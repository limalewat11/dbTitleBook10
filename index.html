<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Introduction to the Devout Life</h2><p>A New Translation of an Enduring Classic. In late 1608, St. Francis de Sales, the Catholic Bishop of Geneva, published his first edition of the Introduction to the Devout Life. It sold out quickly. In September of 1609, he published the second edition with additional material and revisions. A third edition was published in 1610, a fourth in 1616, and his fifth and final edition was published in 1619. This book is a new translation of de Sales' 1619 edition. On December 28th, 1622, St. Francis died at the age of 55. He was canonized a Saint in 1665 and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1877. The depth and breadth of the Introduction, written by one of the Church&#x2019;s eminent spiritual directors, has made it an enduring classic. De Sales' insights and practical guidance for keeping our lives centered on Christ are timeless and will forever change your life and deepen your devotion to God. As St. Francis de Sales says: "LIVE JESUS! Yes, Lord Jesus, live and reign in our hearts forever and ever. Amen."</p><p></p><h2>The School for Good and Evil: The Ever Never Handbook</h2><p><p>Soman Chainani&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>New York Times&nbsp;</em>bestselling series The School for Good and Evil returns with <em>The Ever Never Handbook!</em> Gorgeous full-color illustrations bring your favorite characters like Sophie, Agatha, and Tedros back to school through maps, quizzes, alumni portraits, and more.</p><p>Wish you could go to the School for Good and Evil?

Tens of thousands of people have already used this groundbreaking guide to shatter the vicious sugar stronghold. Now it's your turn!<br><br>Use the easy-to-follow meal plans and more than 90 simple recipes in this book to bust a lifetime of sugar and carb cravings in just three weeks. Three levels of the program make it approachable for anyone, whether you're starting from scratch or from a gluten-free, grain-free, and/or Paleo/primal lifestyle.<br><br><i><b>The 21-Day Sugar Detox</b></i>&nbsp;even includes special modifications for athletes (endurance, CrossFit, HIIT-style, and beyond), pregnant/nursing moms, pescetarians, and people with autoimmune conditions.<br><br>What you'll experience on this program will be different from a lot of other "diet" programs out there that promote extremely restricted eating; encourage you to consume only shakes, juices, or smoothies; or rely heavily on supplements and very-low-calorie or very-low-fat diets to ensure success. The goal of any detox program&nbsp;<i>should</i>&nbsp;be to support your body in naturally cleansing itself of substances that create negative health effects--and that's exactly what&nbsp;<i><b>The 21-Day Sugar Detox</b></i>&nbsp;does.<br><br>By focusing on quality protein, healthy fats, and good carbs, this program will help you change not only the foods you eat, but also your habits around food, and even the way your palate reacts to sweet foods. You'll likely complete the program and continue eating this way much of the time thereafter because you'll feel so amazing. After changing your everyday eating habits, you will begin to gain a new understanding of how food works in your body--and just how much nutrition affects your&nbsp;<i>entire</i>&nbsp;life. There's no reason to wait!<br><br><b>Sugar is taking over our lives.</b><br><br>But why? And is it only those sweet, refined white crystals that are causing us problems, or could there be more to the story?<br><br>Let's be honest: The problem isn't just sugar itself. It's the refined, nutrient-poor carbohydrates that carry tons of calories, but no real nutrition. In our world, these are the easiest foods to grab on the go, but they leave us fat, sick, tired, and downright unhappy.<br><br>The effect that sugar, "hidden" carbs, and refined, processed foods have on our bodies goes far beyond our waistlines. We can't focus, we can't sleep, we have irrational mid-afternoon cravings, and we can't even make it through the day without wanting--or needing--to prop up our energy levels with caffeine or even more sugar! What can we do to break free from this cycle?&nbsp;<i><b>The 21-Day Sugar Detox</b></i>&nbsp;is here to help.<br></p><p><b>Diane Sanfilippo</b> holds a BS from Syracuse University and is a Certified Nutrition Consultant who specializes in blood sugar regulation and digestive health.

They are stuck on the same things. Some of the things that hold climbers back from improving their climbing standard are the same as they were twenty years ago: motivation, managing time, and not being able to analyse and correct their own basic technical or tactical errors. But they are also stuck for a new set of reasons. Twenty years ago, the problem was that no one knew how to train for climbing. Information was scarce and couldn&#39;t travel fast among the participants. Today, it&#39;s the opposite problem. Book after book lists techniques for climbing, exercises for climbing, tips for climbing. Navigating this barrage of information, filtering out the irrelevant and homing in on what matters to your life, your climbing and your circumstances has been the limiting step for today&#39;s climber. This book is the first to present the science of improving at climbing in a way that will actually help you make confident decisions and stay focused on the things that will make the biggest difference. Dave Macleod has crystallised 16 years experience as a world class climber, sport scientist and renowned coach into an accessible and thought provoking guide to improving at rock climbing.</p><p></p><h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage Maps and Miscellany (Accessory, D&amp;D Roleplaying Game)</h2><p><b>Descend into Undermountain with this collection of dungeon maps and adventure cards for the world&#x2019;s greatest roleplaying game. <br></b><br> This accessory contains resources that Dungeon Masters can use to enhance the experience of running <i>Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</i>, a <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> hardcover adventure sold separately. <br><br> Contained within this durable folder are 16 cardstock sheets designed for use with dry-erase markers.

They will learn classic visual storytelling techniques such as conveying meaning with images and directing the viewer's eye. Glebas also teaches how to spot potential problems before they cost time and money, and he offers creative solutions on how to solve them. <br><br>* Uses the classic story of '1001 Arabian Nights' to show how to storyboard stories that will engage an audience's attention and emotions.<br>* With 1001 drawings in graphic novel format plus teaching concepts and commentary.<br>* All of the storyboarding examples have a real project context rather to engage a very visual audience on their own terms and teaches through demonstration.</p><p>Francis Glebas worked as a story artist for Disney Feature Animation on Aladdin, Lion King, Pocahontas, Hunchback of Notre Dame, Dinosaur, Treasure Planet and Hercules. He also directed Pomp and Circumstance starring Donald Duck in Fantasia 2000 and Piglet's BIG Movie.

Francis also works as a creative consultant, having worked with the Irish Government, Korean Government, General Motors, Los Alamos Labs, Walt Disney Imagineering and other film studios.<p></p><p>"Francis Glebas has put together a really comprehensive and thought-provoking look at the art and craft of film making, specifically directing. His approach, which is to ask a lot of seemingly innocent questions, has much the same effect as the good storytelling he is trying to teach us.it draws us in and makes us think. I can't imagine anyone, in or out of our business, who won't find any number of helpful ideas as they work their way through the filmmaking jungles!!"--Roy Disney, Director Emeritus and consultant for The Walt Disney Company "Francis Glebas was one of our most talented storyboard artists at Disney, and it was our great fortune to have him on the story team. He has a wealth of experience to share."--Jeffrey Katzenberg, CEO, Dreamworks Animation</p> <p>"A veritable bible of visual storytelling techniques and advice. Loaded with pictures, the book is set up like a storyboard for the material she wants to convey. Covering everything from why we watch movies to the most effective ways to build and maintain drama, she teaches how to keep your audience riveted to the screen. And if you're worried that you may not have the drawing chops to create good storyboards, don't worry - she's on it. Even if you can't draw a straight line, she teaches how to use whatever you've got, the barest minimum of drawing skills, to create the most effective boards you can imagine. Ever wondered why you look where you do on the screen? It's not a coincidence, the director is pointing your attention in very specific directions. Glebas doesn't just tell you how to direct the eye, she explains the why of it - how our brain works and how the director plays with those elements to convince us that what is taking place on screen is real; and not just real but urgent and dramatic. The book covers everything a director needs to know in order to prepare the storyboard for an effective and memorable film. All you have to add is your story! Highly recommended for the following areas of study: Animation, Theatre, Film Studies at the high school, college, and university levels. And it's a must buy for libraries that collect texts on these subjects."<b>--Animation World Network.com</b></p></p><h2>Colonial America: An Interactive History Adventure (You Choose: Historical Eras)</h2><p>Europeans came to the American colonies in the 1600s and 1700s in search of a better life.

When someone takes it out of an outdated format and makes it readable, searchable and understandable. The Imitation of Christ has been in print for over 500 years for a good reason. It is powerful, beautiful and heart piercing. James Watkins has taken those words and reworked them into ninety daily readings, arranged by topic.

Each dot is a ship; each ship is laden with boxes; each box is laden with goods. In postindustrial economies, we no longer produce but buy, and so we must ship. Without shipping there would be no clothes, food, paper, or fuel. Without all those dots, the world would not work. Yet freight shipping is all but invisible.

A freelance journalist, she has written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Harpers</i>, and the <i>Financial Times</i>. She lives in London.<p>Introduction</p> <p>Friday. No sensible sailor goes to sea on the day of the Crucifixion or the journey will be followed by ill-will and malice. So here I am on a Friday in June, looking up at a giant ship that will carry me from this southern English port of Felixstowe to Singapore, for five weeks and 9,288 nautical miles through the pillars of Hercules, pirate waters, and weather. I stop at the bottom of the ship&#x2019;s gangway, waiting for an escort and stilled and awed by the immensity of this thing, much of her the color of a summer-day sky, so blue; her bottom is painted dull red, her name&#x2014;<i>Maersk Kendal</i>&#x2014;written large on her side.</p> <p>There is such busyness around me. Everything in a modern container port is enormous, overwhelming, crushing. Kendal, of course, but also the thundering trucks, the giant boxes in many colors, the massive gantry cranes that straddle the quay, reaching up ten stories and over to ships that stretch three football pitches in length. There are hardly any humans to be seen. When the journalist Henry Mayhew visited London&#x2019;s docks in 1849, he found &#x201c;decayed and bankrupt master butchers, master bakers, publicans, grocers, old soldiers, old sailors, Polish refugees, broken-down gentlemen, discharged lawyers&#x2019; clerks, suspended Government clerks, almsmen, pensioners, servants, thieves.&#x201d; They have long since gone. This is a Terminator terminal, a place where humans are hidden in crane or truck cabs, where everything is clamorous machines.</p> <p>It took me three train journeys to reach Felixstowe from my northern English home. On one train, where no seats were to be had, I swayed in the vestibule with two men wearing the uniform of a rail freight company. I&#x2019;m about to leave on a freighter, I said, but a ship. They looked bewildered. A ship? they said. &#x201c;Why on earth do you want to go to sea?&#x201d;</p> <p>Why on earth.</p> <p>I am an islander who has never been maritime. I don&#x2019;t sail or dive. I swim, although not in terrifying oceans. But standing here in the noise and industry, looking up almost two hundred feet&#x2014;higher than Niagara Falls&#x2014;to the top of <i>Kendal</i>, I feel the giddiness of a Christmas morning child. Some of this is the rush of escape, for which I had reasons. Some is the pull of the sea. And some comes from the knowledge that I am about to embark to a place and space that is usually off-limits and hidden. The public is not allowed on a ship like this, nor even on the dock. There are no ordinary citizens to witness the workings of an industry that is one of the most fundamental to their daily existence. These ships and boxes belong to a business that feeds, clothes, warms, and supplies us. They have fueled if not created globalization. They are the reason behind your cheap T-shirt and reasonably priced television. But who looks behind a television now and sees the ship that brought it? Who cares about the men who steered your breakfast cereal through winter storms? How ironic that the more ships have grown in size and consequence, the less space they take up in our imagination.</p> <p>The Maritime Foundation, a charity that promotes seafarer matters, recently made a video called <i>Unreported Ocean</i>. It asked the residents of Southampton, a port city in England, how many goods are transported by sea. The answers were varied but uniformly wrong. They all had the interrogative upswing of the unsure.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thirty-five percent?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not a lot?&#x201d;</p> <p>The answer is, nearly everything. Sometimes on trains I play a numbers game. A woman listening to headphones: 8. A man reading a book: 15. The child in the stroller: at least 4 including the stroller. The game is to reckon how many of our clothes and possessions and food products have been transported by ship. The beads around the woman&#x2019;s neck; the man&#x2019;s iPhone and Japanese-made headphones. Her Sri Lanka&#x2013;made skirt and blouse; his printed-in-China book. I can always go wider, deeper, and in any direction. The fabric of the seats. The rolling stock. The fuel powering the train. The conductor&#x2019;s uniform; the coffee in my cup; the fruit in my bag. Definitely the fruit, so frequently shipped in refrigerated containers that it has been given its own temperature. Two degrees Celsius is &#x201c;chill&#x201d; but 13 degrees is &#x201c;banana.&#x201d;</p> <p>Trade carried by sea has grown fourfold since 1970 and is still growing. In 2011, the 360 commercial ports of the United States took in international goods worth $1.73 trillion, or eighty times the value of all U.S. trade in 1960. There are more than one hundred thousand ships at sea carrying all the solids, liquids, and gases that we need to live. Only six thousand are container vessels like <i>Kendal</i>, but they make up for this small proportion by their dizzying capacity. The biggest container ship can carry fifteen thousand boxes. It can hold 746 million bananas, one for every European on one ship. If the containers of Maersk alone were lined up, they would stretch eleven thousand miles or nearly halfway around the planet. If they were stacked instead, they would be fifteen hundred miles high, 7,530 Eiffel Towers. If <i>Kendal</i> discharged her containers onto trucks, the line of traffic would be sixty miles long.</p> <p>Trade has always traveled and the world has always traded. Ours, though, is the era of extreme interdependence. Hardly any nation is now self-sufficient. In 2011, the United Kingdom shipped in half of its gas. The United States relies on ships to bring in two-thirds of its oil supplies. Every day, thirty-eight million tons of crude oil sets off by sea somewhere, although you may not notice it. As in Los Angeles, New York, and other port cities, London has moved its working docks out of the city, away from residents. Ships are bigger now and need deeper harbors, so they call at Newark or Tilbury or Felixstowe, not Liverpool or South Street. Security concerns have hidden ports further, behind barbed wire and badge wearing and keep out signs. To reach this quayside in Felixstowe, I had to pass through several gatekeepers and passport controllers, and past radiation-detecting gates often triggered by naturally radioactive cargo such as cat litter and broccoli.</p> <p>It is harder to wander into the world of shipping, now, so people don&#x2019;t. The chief of the British navy&#x2014;who is known as the First Sea Lord, although the army chief is not a Land Lord&#x2014;says we suffer from &#x201c;sea blindness&#x201d; now. We travel by cheap flights, not ocean liners. The sea is a distance to be flown over, a downward backdrop between takeoff and landing, a blue expanse that soothes on the moving flight map as the plane jerks over it. It is for leisure and beaches and fish and chips, not for use or work. Perhaps we believe that everything travels by air, or magically and instantaneously like information (which is actually anchored by cables on the seabed), not by hefty ships that travel more slowly than senior citizens drive.</p> <p>You could trace the flight of the ocean from our consciousness in the pages of great newspapers. Fifty years ago, the shipping news was news. Cargo departures were reported daily. Now the most necessary business on the planet has mostly been shunted into the pages of specialized trade papers such as <i>Lloyd&#x2019;s List</i> and the <i>Journal of Commerce</i>, fine publications but out of the reach of most, when an annual subscription to <i>Lloyd&#x2019;s List</i> costs more than $2,000 a year. In 1965, shipping was so central to daily life in London that when Winston Churchill&#x2019;s funeral barge left Tower Pier to travel up the Thames, it embarked in front of dock cranes that dipped their jibs, movingly, with respect. The cranes are gone now or immobile, garden furniture for wharves that house costly apartments or indifferent restaurants.</p> <p>Humans have sent goods by water for four thousand years. In the fifteenth century BC, Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt sent a fleet to the Land of Punt and brought back panther skins and ebony, frankincense and dancing pygmies. Perhaps Hatshepsut counts as the first shipping tycoon, before the Romans, Phoenicians, and Greeks took over (she was certainly the only Egyptian queen who preferred to be called king). Shipping history is full of such treats and treasures. Cardamom, silk, ginger, and gold, ivory and saffron. The Routes of Spice, Tea, and Salt, of Amber and Incense. There were trade winds, sailor towns and sails, chaos and color. Now there are freight routes, turnarounds, and boxes, and the cool mechanics of modern industry, but there is still intrigue and fortune. Maersk ships travel regular routes named Boomerang and Yo Yo (from Australia and Yokohama), or the Bossa Nova and Samba around South America. There are wealthy tycoons still, Norse, Greek, and Danish, belonging to family companies who maintain a level of privacy that makes a Swiss banker seem verbose. Publicly listed shipping companies are still a minority. Even shipping people admit that their industry is clubby, insular, difficult. In this business, it is considered normal that the official Greek shipowners&#x2019; association refuses to say how many members it has, because it can.</p> <p>Maersk is different. It must be, because it is letting me onto a working ship, usually barred to ordinary citizens. Even Maersk officers are no longer permitted to take family members to sea because of concerns about safety from pirates. But Maersk is known for risks, at least in the places where its name is known at all, which is in shipping and Denmark. I find Maersk fascinating. It is the Coca-Cola of freight with none of the fame. Its parent company A. P. M�ller&#x2013;Maersk is Denmark&#x2019;s largest company, its sales equal to 20 percent of Denmark&#x2019;s GDP; its ships use more oil than the entire nation. I like the fact that Maersk is not a household name outside the pages of <i>Lloyd&#x2019;s List</i>; that it has an online store selling Maersk-branded T-shirts and cookie tins called Stargate, after the company symbol of a seven-point star, white on a background of Maersk Blue, a distinct color that can be created from a Pantone recipe. The star has seven points, goes an employee joke, because they work seven days a week. I like that Maersk is a first name. It&#x2019;s like a massive global corporation named Derek. For much of recent history the company was run by Arnold Maersk Mc-Kinney M�ller, son of the founder, a pleasingly eccentric patriarch who worked until he died in 2012 at age ninety-eight. Mr. M�ller was known for his firm control of his firm; for walking up five flights of stairs to his office, although when he reached ninety-four he allowed his driver to carry his briefcase; for being one of only three commoners to receive Denmark&#x2019;s Order of the Elephant; and for driving around Copenhagen in a modest car although he was one of the two richest people in Denmark. The other inherited Lego.</p> <p>Reuters, in a profile of Maersk, describes it as &#x201c;active primarily in the marine transportation sector.&#x201d; Behind that &#x201c;primarily&#x201d; are multitudes. Founded in 1904 with one ship named <i>Svendborg</i>, Maersk&#x2014;through its subsidiary Maersk Line&#x2014;now operates the largest container shipping company in the world, with a fleet of six hundred vessels. It also has the vast and dizzying interests of a global corporation. It is active in 130 countries and has 117,000 employees. It is looking for and drilling for oil and gas in Denmark, Angola, Brazil, Greenland, Qatar, Algeria, Norway, Iraq, the United States, and Kazakhstan. If you have visited Denmark, you have probably shopped in a Maersk-owned supermarket. You can save in a Maersk-owned bank. The list of its companies and subsidiaries is twelve pages long, double columns. Its revenues in 2011 were $60.2 billion, only slightly less than Microsoft&#x2019;s. Microsoft provides the software that runs computers; Maersk brings us the computers. One is infamous. Somehow the other is mostly invisible.</p> <p>This is remarkable, given the size of its ambition. Maersk is known for its experiments with economies of scale. Its E class ship (according to an internal classification system) <i>Emma Maersk</i>, built in 2005, excited the industry partly because she could carry at least fifteen thousand containers. Triple-E class ships, expected in 2014, will carry eighteen thousand and be able to fit a full-sized American football field, an ice-hockey arena, and a basketball court in their holds, if they care to. <i>Emma</i> was envied by naval architects and engineers, but her arrival in Felixstowe in December 2006 also caught the public imagination. With her 150 tons of New Zealand lamb and 138,000 tins of cat food, she carried 12,800 MP-3 players, 33,000 cocktail shakers, and 2 million Christmas decorations; she became SS <i>Santa</i>, come to call.</p> <p>SS <i>Santa</i> demonstrated more than industrial hubris. She also proved how little an ordinary citizen understands about shipping. For two weeks afterward, Felixstowe received calls from people wanting to know if she was still in port. She had come and gone in twenty-four hours. I have met well-meaning men&#x2014;and too few women&#x2014;in boardrooms across London and New York who complain about this ignorance. They want a more visible image for an industry that in the UK alone employs 634,900 people, contributes �8.45 billion in taxes, and generates 2 percent of the national economy, more than restaurants, takeaway food, and civil engineering combined, and only just behind the construction industry. They despair that shipping draws attention only with drama and disaster: a cruise ship sinking, or an oil spill and blackened birds. They would like people to know the names of the <i>Wec Vermeer</i>, arrived from Leix�es and heading for Rotterdam, or the <i>Zim Genoa</i>, due in from Ashdod, not just <i>Exxon Valdez</i> and <i>Titanic</i>. They provide statistics showing that the dark days of oil spills are over. Between 1972 and 1981, there were 223 spills. Over the last decade there were 63. Each year, a shipping publicist told me, &#x201c;More oil is poured down the drain by mechanics changing their engine oil than is spilled by the world&#x2019;s fleet of oil tankers.&#x201d;</p> <p>Yet the invisibility is useful, too. There are few industries as defiantly opaque as shipping. Even offshore bankers have not developed a system as intricately elusive as the flag of convenience, under which ships can fly the flag of a state that has nothing to do with its owner, cargo, crew, or route. Look at the backside of boats and you will see home ports of Panama City and Monrovia, not Le Havre or Hamburg, but neither crew nor ship will have ever been to Liberia or Mongolia, a landlocked country that nonetheless has a shipping fleet. For the International Chamber of Shipping, which thinks &#x201c;flags of convenience&#x201d; too pejorative a term (it prefers the sanitized &#x201c;open registries&#x201d;), there is &#x201c;nothing inherently wrong&#x201d; with this system. A former U.S. Coast Guard commander preferred to call it &#x201c;managed anarchy.&#x201d;</p> <p>Danish-owned <i>Kendal</i> has also flagged out, but to the national registry of the United Kingdom. On her monkey deck she flies the Red Ensign, the British maritime Union flag. This makes her a rarity. After the Second World War, the great powers in shipping were Britain and the United States. They had ships and supplied men to sail them. In 1961 the United Kingdom had 142,462 working seafarers. The United States owned 1,268 ships. Now British seafarers number around 24,000. There are fewer than one hundred oceangoing U.S.-flagged ships. Only 1 percent of trade at U.S. ports travels on an American-flagged ship, and the U.S. fleet has declined by 82 percent since 1951. Who in western Europe or America now knows a working seafarer? At a nautical seminar held on a tall ship&#x2014;a proper old sailing vessel&#x2014;in Glasgow, a tanker captain told a story that got laughs, but it was sad. When online forms offer him drop-down options to describe his career, he selects...</p></p><h2>Like Dreamers: The Story of the Israeli Paratroopers Who Reunited Jerusalem and Divided a Nation</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the Everett Family Jewish Book of the Year Award (a National Jewish Book Award) and the RUSA Sophie Brody Medal.</strong></p><p>In <em>Like Dreamers</em>, acclaimed journalist Yossi Klein Halevi interweaves the stories of a group of 1967 paratroopers who reunited Jerusalem, tracing the history of Israel and the divergent ideologies shaping it from the Six-Day War to the present.</p><p>Following the lives of seven young members from the 55th Paratroopers Reserve Brigade, the unit responsible for restoring Jewish sovereignty to Jerusalem, Halevi reveals how this band of brothers played pivotal roles in shaping Israel&#x2019;s destiny long after their historic victory.

The most symbolic triumph for the young nation was the reunification of Israeli West Jerusalem and Jordanian East Jerusalem, achieved at great cost by a group of paratroopers from the 55th Paratroopers Reserve Brigade. In restoring Jewish sovereignty to the Holy City, these men fulfilled the dream of two millennia, changing the history of Israel and of the Middle East. And as veteran journalist Yossi Klein Halevi shows in <em>Like Dreamers</em>, they played pivotal roles in shaping Israel's destiny long after their resounding military success.</p><p>A masterful storyteller, Halevi tracks down seven members of the 55th Brigade and traces their lives through the decades following the Six-Day War. But as his narrative reveals, despite the intensity of their shared experience protecting Israel, in their postwar paths they nurture drastically divergent visions for the country's future. Yoel Bin-Nun emerges at the forefront of the religious Zionist West Bank settlement movement, but Arik Achmon&#x2014;the chief intelligence officer of the 55th&#x2014;becomes a spiritual father of the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. Achmon becomes a driving force in the growth of Israel's capitalist economy, whereas Avital Geva, in addition to building a reputation as a leading conceptual artist, ardently defends the socialist kibbutzim. And while Geva is among the foremost activists in Peace Now, Udi Adiv helps create an anti-Zionist terror underground in Damascus, eventually serving twelve years in an Israeli prison.</p><p>Charting the ideological differences among this band of brothers, Halevi weaves a nuanced and insightful chronicle of modern Israel. His fascinating, diligently researched examination of each man's motivations and actions&#x2014;supported by extensive interviews with their friends, family members, and comrades-in-arms&#x2014;humanizes the country 's complex political landscape, facilitating a deeper understanding of the forces that influence its evolution as a state.</p><p>Yossi Klein Halevi is an American-born writer who has lived in Jerusalem since 1982. He is a senior fellow of the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem and the author of&nbsp;<em>At the Entrance to the Garden of Eden:&nbsp;A Jew's Search for God with Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Like Dreamers: The Story of the Israeli Paratroopers Who Reunited Jerusalem and Divided a Nation</em>, which won the Jewish Book Council's Everett Family Book of the Year Award for Best Jewish Book in 2013.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.<p>I</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The sun beats down on the palace, and Lerial tries not to trudge as he makes his way out into the private south courtyard that has always served as the arms practice area for the family&#x2014;since the palace was completed some ten years earlier. The north and south courtyards are the same size, half that of the main central courtyard, with its multiple fountains and its walled gardens. The north courtyard has two fountains, making it cooler than the south courtyard, with its small single fountain, its paved open area for weapons practice, while the central courtyard boasts four fountains, spaced so that their mist cools the entire open space.</p> <p>The wooden wand Lerial carries feels heavier than the cupridium blade he will use once his father has decided he is accomplished enough to ride with the Lancers on patrol missions, against either Heldyan border forces or the nomadic raiders that occasionally make their way northward through the grasslands of Merowey.</p> <p>Lerial knows the heavy feel of the wand comes from what awaits him in sparring with Lephi, who is only three years older, and not that much taller, but far more at ease with a weapon in his hand than is Lerial, whether the weapon is a sabre or a bow or lance, not that Lerial has had any practice with a lance, and little enough with a bow.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you ready?&#x201d; asks Lephi from the sunlit center of the courtyard, where he stands waiting, raising the heavy wooden wand that approximates a Lancer&#x2019;s sabre.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming.&#x201d; Lerial walks from the shadows cast by the three upper levels of the palace and into the sunlight, a brightness whose intensity always seems to surprise him. He can feel the fine grit under the soles of his boots, grit that is everywhere no matter how often the rough courtyard tiles are swept.</p> <p>Lephi, of course, stands with his back to the sun. Lerial takes a position with the brilliant white sun to his left and motions with his wand for Lephi to move to a point directly across the circle marked in red and black tiles.</p> <p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do that in battle,&#x201d; observes Lephi.</p> <p>&#x201c;No&nbsp;&#x2026; but I can choose to fight or not and take a position.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not always.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lerial just waits for Lephi to move or attack.</p> <p>After several moments, Lephi moves, taking a position directly across from his younger brother. Lerial sets his feet, lifts his blade, and concentrates on Lephi and his brother&#x2019;s wand.</p> <p>Lephi half turns, starts to do what looks to be a thrust, but Lerial knows the movement is a feint, because his brother&#x2019;s feet do not move, nor does he shift his weight. Instead of trying to block a thrust that will not come, Lerial merely holds his guard. Then Lephi suddenly drops and brings his wand up, and Lerial barely can beat down the thrust and has to move to the side.</p> <p>Wands move quickly, and then even more quickly. Lerial is already sweating heavily with the effort of countering Lephi&#x2019;s constant attacks, thrusts, and counterthrusts&nbsp;&#x2026; and just trying to react.</p> <p>Abruptly, Lephi turns a thrust into a twisting move that rips Lerial&#x2019;s wand out of his sweaty hand. The older youth grins. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t see that one.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lerial doesn&#x2019;t reply but moves to the side of the circle to recover his wand. When he picks it up, the grip of the hilt feels rougher in places where grit has clung to the dampness from his hand. Maybe that will help.</p> <p>In the shadows, he can see Amaira, and her mother, his aunt Emerya, and Ryalah, all three sitting at a small table. Amaira and Ryalah are playing pegboard, but Emerya has been watching the sparring. Why? The other courtyards are cooler. He is still wondering when Lephi speaks.</p> <p>&#x201c;That was quick. Do you want to try again?&#x201d; Lephi lifts his wand.</p> <p>Lerial considers the invitation, ignoring Lephi&#x2019;s tone, a tone that implies that Lerial is smaller and weaker, and always will be. He smiles, painful as it is. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t get any better if I don&#x2019;t keep trying.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the spirit.&#x201d;</p> <p>Again, Lerial can sense the undertone by which Lephi suggests all the trying in the world won&#x2019;t help Lerial. He finds his teeth clenching. He takes a deep breath and tries to relax before he slowly walks back and takes a position on the edge of the circle.</p> <p>Lerial and Lephi spar for almost a glass.</p> <p>By the time they are both exhausted, Lerial&#x2019;s shirt is dripping wet, and he has bruises in too many places. Those bruises would be far worse if Lephi had not pulled his strikes, Lerial knows, and that leaves him feeling even more despondent when he leaves the circle.</p> <p>Ryalah and Amaira have left, perhaps following Lephi, but Emerya remains at the table near the small fountain.</p> <p>&#x201c;You worked hard, Lerial,&#x201d; she says kindly.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hard, yes, but not good enough to hold my own.&#x201d; Lerial takes a deep breath. &#x201c;There ought to be a way for me to do better against Lephi.&#x201d; He tries to keep his words from sounding despondent, even though that is how he feels. He glances at his aunt, whose once shimmering red hair is now mostly white, although he can sense that she still is a strong healer with a core of black order.</p> <p>&#x201c;There is&nbsp;&#x2026; if you&#x2019;re willing to work at it,&#x201d; Emerya says quietly.</p> <p>&#x201c;There is? Really? Can you show me?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re willing to pay the price.&#x201d;</p> <p>The utter seriousness of her tone and the feeling of truthfulness behind her words cools his enthusiasm almost as quickly as a bucket of winter water from the Swarth might have.</p> <p>&#x201c;Come see me after dinner. If anyone asks, tell them that I think it&#x2019;s time for you to learn something about battlefield healing.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t that be lying? If it is, Mother will know.&#x201d; If she concentrates.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to begin teaching you about some healing, and I will. That will help you with bladework.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lerial can&#x2019;t help but frown.</p> <p>&#x201c;Trust me. It will. It will also be harder than practicing with Lephi&nbsp;&#x2026; until you learn how.&#x201d; Emerya smiles. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s true of every skill worth having, you&#x2019;ll discover.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You sound like Grandmere.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Where do you think I learned such matters?&#x201d; For a moment, Emerya seems to be somewhere else. Abruptly, she smiles. &#x201c;After dinner, then? My apartments?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you. I&#x2019;ll be there.&#x201d; What other choice does he have? No matter how hard Lerial tries, no matter how much instruction he gets from his father, or from Undercaptain Woelyt, Lephi seems to be getting better faster than he is.</p> <p>He takes his time walking back to his room up on the third level, where the breezes are stronger, but it is a good glass before he has cooled down enough to wash up and change into trousers and a plain pale green shirt for dinner. He walks to the window and stands there, letting the light spring breeze flow past him as he looks to the north, out over the small city that Cigoerne has become just in the years he can remember. Once there was the single pier where the <i>Kerial</i> had been moored until operating the fireship had become too dangerous, and Lerial&#x2019;s father had ordered it dismantled and the fittings and metal turned to other uses, with the limited amount of cupridium remaining being chaos-forged into Lancer sabres, lighter and stronger than the heavy iron blades of Afrit or Heldya. Now there are two shorter piers, used mostly for trading vessels&nbsp;&#x2026; and the handful of craft used by the Lancers to patrol the river.</p> <p>Finally, Lerial makes his way down to the small dining terrace off the main courtyard. There, every evening when the weather is good and when his father is in Cigoerne, the family shares refreshments before dining. At least, Lerial reflects, they have for as long as the palace has been complete, and that has been for not quite eleven years, not that he can remember those first years very clearly.</p> <p>His mother is already there, sitting at the largest table and talking with his aunt. Unlike Emerya, Xeranya is blond, with shoulder-length curly hair, and freckles that Lerial has inherited across her nose and below her eyes, eyes that are a watery but penetrating green. She has a strong nose, like Lerial, and an equally strong chin, unlike Lerial, whose chin is more modest. She wears a green blouse and loose green pantaloons, what most healers wear, especially in public, where all women also wear loose silky scarves that cover their hair and lower face&#x2014;or are supposed to do so.</p> <p>Emerya, dressed in similar fashion, although the green of her garb is slightly darker, nods to Lerial and then looks back to Xeranya. Amaira and Ryalah are at another small table, moving the pegs on the circular board.</p> <p>&#x201c;I won!&#x201d; declares Ryalah. &#x201c;This time I won!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Good, dear,&#x201d; says Xeranya, in the calm voice that Lerial associates with healers, since both his mother and Emerya speak that way, and so did his grandmother, and all were healers. &#x201c;But please don&#x2019;t shout it to the world. Boasting is very unbecoming.&#x201d;</p> <p>The brown-eyed and dark-haired Amaira offers an amused smile, and Lerial understands that Ryalah&#x2019;s victory might not have been entirely due to her skill.</p> <p><i>That&#x2019;s fine when you&#x2019;re six, but if Lephi tried that now, you&#x2019;d be furious.</i> As it is, Lerial bridles at his older brother&#x2019;s condescending attitude when they spar.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good evening, Mother, Aunt Emerya!&#x201d; Lephi&#x2019;s cheerful voice comes from behind Lerial. He strides past Lerial toward the refreshment table. There he picks up a glass carafe&#x2014;the crystal carafes are reserved for meals with officials from Swartheld or with important merchanters&#x2014;and starts to fill a squarish tumbler with a pale red vintage.</p> <p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to drink wine, Lephi,&#x201d; Xeranya says, &#x201c;water it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, Mother.&#x201d; Lephi smiles.</p> <p>Lerial can order-sense his brother&#x2019;s anger, and that means both his aunt, and possibly his mother, can as well, but no one says a word.</p> <p>Lephi pours a small amount of water into the wine and swirls it, then walks over to the large round table that will seat eight, but is occupied only by the two women. He takes a seat on the far side of the table, facing the nearest fountain in the courtyard, a fountain with a set of nozzles that encircle a statue of Lerial and Lephi&#x2019;s grandsire, the Emperor Lephi, and spray a mist that both shrouds the statue and helps cool the courtyard. In turn, Lerial steps to the refreshment table and half fills a pewter mug with the light lager. He joins the others at the &#x201c;adult&#x201d; table, taking a place beside Emerya.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a cool spring, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; asks Xeranya, clearly changing the subject from whatever she and Emerya had been discussing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Cooler than last year, but warmer than two years ago,&#x201d; replies Emerya. &#x201c;I still think we&#x2019;ll have a hot summer. The river&#x2019;s lower, too, a good yard.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You think that will affect the maize?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not here, but it will farther downstream, especially south of Luba.&#x201d; Emerya glances toward the archway that leads to the main corridor of the palace.</p> <p>&#x201c;Will that mean raiders from Afrit?&#x201d; asks Lephi.</p> <p>Lerial can sense the eagerness in his brother&#x2019;s voice. <i>Because Father has said he can ride on some Lancer patrols?</i></p> <p>&#x201c;The arms-commander of Afrit has sent a dispatch to your father saying that, if there are raiders, he will be pleased to execute publicly any who are captured, either by our Lancers or his armsmen.&#x201d; Xeranya smiles. &#x201c;I suspect that dispatch was posted in every Afritan town on our northern border.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That might not stop them,&#x201d; Lephi declares.</p> <p>&#x201c;It will,&#x201d; says Emerya. &#x201c;The Duke&#x2019;s arms-commander is a man of his word, for better or worse.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lephi starts to say something&#x2014;until Xeranya looks at him.</p> <p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have problems with Afrit, and we don&#x2019;t need them,&#x201d; Xeranya says, as though Lephi had not even opened his mouth. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s a hot summer again this year, we&#x2019;ll have to deal with more marauders from Merowey&nbsp;&#x2026; and who knows what the Duke of Heldya will do?&#x201d;</p> <p>Emerya nods.</p> <p>At that moment, Xeranya glances in the direction of the archway, then smiles in pleasure as a tall and broad-shouldered figure steps onto the terrace. &#x201c;Kiedron, dear, I was getting worried.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to worry about.&#x201d; The Duke of Cigoerne offers a smile in return as he nears the table. His dark brown hair still shows not a sign of silver, nor do his thick dark eyebrows, nor would any beard he grew, although he has never grown one, not that Lerial recalls. &#x201c;The tariff inspectors found finished cloth inside cotton bales in a Meroweyan flatboat headed to Swartheld. The trader who owns the flatboat insisted that he&#x2019;d taken the cargo on good faith&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t like the idea of the Duke of Cigoerne acting as a tariff justicer for Afrit,&#x201d; declares Xeranya.</p> <p>&#x201c;We can use the golds, and they only call for me when it&#x2019;s a question of law.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But Afrit gets half the golds,&#x201d; says Xeranya.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d both suffer if they paid tariffs to us and then to Afrit,&#x201d; replies Kiedron. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d have to patrol the Swarth day and night. Whether they port here or in Swartheld or any of the Afrit river towns, we get a share of the tariffs.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not a huge share,&#x201d; rejoins Xeranya. &#x201c;And we have to rely on the Duke&#x2019;s count.&#x201d;</p> <p>That, Lerial knows, is always less than it should be, but it is another matter never mentioned except among family&#x2014;and never by any children.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s better than fighting over it, don&#x2019;t you think? Besides, the arrangement means that more traders from the south stop here for provisions and other goods that they can sell downriver without paying tariffs. That&#x2019;s helped build Cigoerne. We can&#x2019;t afford to dream about what cannot yet be. We just need to build, brick by brick. Those tariffs are what funded the ministry building and what pay for not only the river port inspectors but also for some of the tariff collectors and others.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What did you decide on the cloth smuggler?&#x201d; asks Emerya smoothly before Xeranya can say more.</p> <p>&#x201c;We took a tenth part of the cloth and fined him two golds. He should consider himself fortunate.&#x201d;</p> <p>Even Lerial knows that the cloth or the proceeds from its sale will not be reported to Duke Atroyan&#x2019;s inspectors. The golds will, because they are recorded on the passage documents.</p> <p>&#x201c;He should indeed,&#x201d; declares Xeranya.</p> <p>&#x201c;And for dinner?&#x201d; asks Kiedron, before turning to the refreshment table and pouring a full tumbler of the deep red wine.</p> <p>&#x201c;Goat biastras,&#x201d; replies Xeranya. &#x201c;Young goat.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lerial wonders from where the cooks had obtained the marinated sweet peppers that surround the strips of braised goat before each tube is batter-dipped and fried. It seems early for peppers.</p> <p>&#x201c;The peppers came from the sheltered garden on the south side of the palace, Lerial,&#x201d; explains Emerya.</p> <p>Her reply to his unspoken question reminds him, again, of how really good healers can sense how people feel even when they say nothing or their faces reveal little, although he suspects his expression might well have been less than impassive.</p> <p>&#x201c;Better biastras than burhka,&#x201d; says Kiedron with a smile.</p> <p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;d actually prefer the burhka.&#x201d; Xeranya smiles. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re having that for dinner tomorrow, but I&#x2019;ll tell the cooks to be sparing with the chilies.&#x201d;</p> <p>Before long, everyone is seated at the long dining table, with Lerial&#x2019;s father at the head, and his mother to his right, and Lephi to his left. Emerya sits beside Lephi and Lerial beside his mother and across from his aunt. Amaira is seated on Lerial&#x2019;s other side, with Ryalah beside Emerya.</p> <p>Because he serves Amaira before himself, Lerial is one of the last to try a biastra. He hopes that the &#x201c;young&#x201d; goat is less gamey than what he has tasted before. Not only is it barely gamey, but the white cream sauce he has drizzled over the biastra is excellent, with the piquancy of a good cheese and a hint...</p></p><h2>Ghoul</h2><p>In 1984, Timmy Graco and his friends find their summer vacation plagued by terror, adventure, and evil when they stumble upon a nightmarish creature eating the dead in a local cemetery, who then starts attacking the living, forcing them to take action.

Indeed, at a moment when anyone may engage in direct transactions internationally for services previously bought and sold only locally (lodging, for instance, through online sites), it has become clear that, even in ordinary matters, judicial awareness can no longer stop at the water&#x2019;s edge.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br> To trace how foreign considerations have come to inform the thinking of the Court, Justice Breyer begins with that area of the law in which they have always figured prominently: national security in its constitutional dimension&#x2014;how should the Court balance this imperative with others, chiefly the protection of basic liberties, in its review of presidential and congressional actions? He goes on to show that as the world has grown steadily &#x201c;smaller,&#x201d; the Court&#x2019;s horizons have inevitably expanded: it has been obliged to consider a great many more matters that now cross borders. What is the geographical reach of an American statute concerning, say, securities fraud, antitrust violations, or copyright protections? And in deciding such matters, can the Court interpret American laws so that they might work more efficiently with similar laws in other nations?<br><br>While Americans must necessarily determine their own laws through democratic process, increasingly, the smooth operation of American law&#x2014;and, by extension, the advancement of American interests and values&#x2014;depends on its working in harmony with that of other jurisdictions. Justice Breyer describes how the aim of cultivating such harmony, as well as the expansion of the rule of law overall, with its attendant benefits, has drawn American jurists into the relatively new role of &#x201c;constitutional diplomats,&#x201d; a little remarked but increasingly important job for them in this fast-changing world.<br><br> Written with unique authority and perspective, <i>The Court and the World</i> reveals an emergent reality few Americans observe directly but one that affects the life of every one of us.

He is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C.9781101946190|excerpt<br><br>Breyer / THE COURT AND THE WORLD<br><br>1<br><br>Silence<br><br>Cicero and His &#x201c;Political Question&#x201d; Counterpart<br><br>&#x201c;the laws fall silent&#x201d;<br><br>Cicero set forth what would eventually become one of the best-�known legal principles concerning the role of courts during wartime. Two thousand years ago he wrote, &#x201c;Silent enim leges inter arma,&#x201d; which I should like to translate as &#x201c;When the cannons roar, the laws fall silent.&#x201d; When the senator wrote those words, he was responding to civil strife that had erupted in Rome, where armed gangs had taken control of the streets. They were never punished, for their leaders had been elected to public office. Still, we see the point of Cicero&#x2019;s remark: When the security of the state is threatened, do not expect the laws to apply. To what extent has that principle governed the actions of American courts?<br><br>Consider the principle in the context of the American Civil War. At the very outset, President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus.1 That ancient writ traditionally allows anyone in detention to challenge the lawfulness of his confinement by getting word to a judge that he is being held, in his view, without legal authority. And the judge can then tell the jailer, the local sheriff, say, to &#x201c;bring me the body.&#x201d; Questioning both the jailer and the prisoner, the judge can discover the legal basis, or the lack thereof, for the prisoner&#x2019;s detention. It would be difficult to point to a more important legal protection against arbitrary imprisonment.<br><br>President Lincoln&#x2019;s suspension of the writ in effect allowed his military to arrest civilians arbitrarily, without court review. He had seen firsthand a pressing need for such an extraordinary measure. On the way to his inauguration, he had been forced to sneak through Baltimore under cover of night in order to avoid a pro-�secession mob, while transferring from one train station to another.2 Lincoln knew that Union troops from the West and the North would have to negotiate the same station transfer on their way south. And he feared the effect this might have on their ability to travel, on the city of Baltimore itself, and on the State of Maryland, which itself stood on the brink of secession.3<br><br>By suspending the writ, Lincoln intended to allow Northern troops to arrest disloyal Baltimore citizens. And that is just what they did. Early on the morning of May 25, 1861, on the orders of General William H. Keim, they arrested John Merryman, who had been a ringleader in anti-�Northern riots that spring, and held him at Fort McHenry, a nearby post under the command of General George Cadwalader.4 Merryman immediately asked a nearby federal court to issue a writ of habeas corpus. And the court&#x2019;s judge, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, sitting as a local circuit judge, agreed to do so.5<br><br>At first glance, Lincoln&#x2019;s actions to stop judges like Taney from issuing the writ might seem constitutional, for the Constitution authorizes suspension of the writ of habeas corpus &#x201c;when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.&#x201d;6 But this grant of authority appears in Article I, which deals with Congress&#x2019;s powers, not in Article II, which addresses the powers of the President. Hence, Taney concluded, the President, by acting without congressional authority, had violated the Constitution.7<br><br>President Lincoln&#x2019;s reaction to the court&#x2019;s decision is well known. He did not release John Merryman. Neither did he appeal the ruling, as he might have done. Rather, he defended his right to take decisive unilateral action. A few weeks after Merryman&#x2019;s arrest, he asked Congress, &#x201c;Are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?&#x201d;8 A week later Attorney General Edward Bates presented Congress with a report justifying Lincoln&#x2019;s decision to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.9<br><br>Still, the same day as the Bates report, Merryman was released on bail, and Lincoln did not prosecute him. And two years later Congress itself suspended the writ of habeas corpus, thereby curing the constitutional defect. The controversy about the President&#x2019;s powers fizzled out without any definite resolution.10<br><br>Merryman&#x2019;s detention, however, is but one of many examples of how President Lincoln suspended or sidestepped constitutional protections of civil liberty in the name of national security. He also authorized his generals to censor the press, to prevent citizens from speaking vociferously against the war (accusing the President of &#x201c;malfeasance,&#x201d; for example), to arrest suspected supporters of the enemy, and, often, to hold prisoners without trial irrespective of whether ordinary courts where they might have been tried were open and functioning. The generals exercising this authority did so by general order; they did not need to prove that, say, hostilities required their actions. In this way, they imprisoned about thirteen thousand citizens during the war.11 Secretary of State William H. Seward once told a British minister,<br><br>I can touch a bell on my right hand and order the imprisonment of a citizen of Ohio; I can touch a bell again and order the imprisonment of a citizen of New York; and no power on earth, except that of the President, can release them. Can the Queen of England do so much?12<br><br>This attitude reflects that of many American presidents during wartime. During World War I, the Wilson administration successfully prosecuted distributors of leaflets urging resistance to the draft. It barred leftist magazines from using the mails. And it jailed Eugene V. Debs, the leader of the American Socialist Party (who subsequently received nearly one million votes in the presidential election of 1920 while incarcerated).13 During World War II, President Roosevelt ordered the internment of more than seventy thousand Americans of Japanese origin, an action that the Supreme Court upheld.<br><br>Roosevelt&#x2019;s attorney general, Francis Biddle, once said that &#x201c;[t]he Constitution has not greatly bothered any wartime President.&#x201d;14 During war, the executive and legislative branches typically believe that the foreign threat&#x2014;�not the preservation of civil liberties&#x2014;�is the paramount concern. And at times throughout American history, the judiciary has agreed. While the Civil War raged, with the exception of Merryman, the courts did not meaningfully interfere with presidential or legislative decisions.<br><br>Once the Civil War was over, however, the Court was in a position to take a different view, and in 1866 it heard the case of Ex parte Milligan. Two years earlier, just before the war&#x2019;s conclusion, a Northern general stationed with his troops in Indiana had arrested Lambdin P. Milligan and four other civilians. The general charged them with conspiring to foment an insurrection designed to help the South. He set up a special military tribunal, which tried the accused, convicted them, and passed a sentence of death. The defendants asked an ordinary federal court to hear their claim that the army could not try American citizens in a special military court, at least not when conditions in the area were peaceful and ordinary civil courts were open. The case eventually reached the Supreme Court.15<br><br>Urging the Court to deny the defendants&#x2019; claim, the government&#x2019;s lawyer took a page from Cicero and argued that &#x201c;[t]he officer executing martial law is at the same time supreme legislator, supreme judge, and supreme executive. As necessity makes his will the law, he only can define and declare it.&#x201d;16 The government maintained that the Constitution&#x2019;s provisions protecting basic human rights are &#x201c;peace provisions . . . and, like all other conventional and legislative laws and enactments, are silent amidst arms, and when the safety of the people becomes the supreme law.&#x201d;17<br><br>The Court unanimously rejected this claim. All its members agreed that the Constitution&#x2019;s protections applied and that Milligan must be released. A minority of the justices added an explanation to the effect that Congress had not enacted legislation permitting military trials for civilians, implying that the result might have been different under such circumstances.18 The majority, however, held that the Constitution did not permit military trials of American civilians in places where, and at times when, ordinary civil courts were open, whether or not Congress enacted laws authorizing such proceedings.19<br><br>Milligan, then, represents something of a retreat on the part of the Court from the absolutism of Cicero, and a willingness to enforce constitutional protections in the face of a claim by the executive that the laws should be silent &#x201c;amidst arms.&#x201d; Still, it bears emphasizing that the case was decided only after the war had ended and relative normalcy had returned. We should not be surprised to find a different judicial attitude in later cases decided in the heat of battle, such as the World War II case of Korematsu. If Milligan signaled to the executive branch that there were limits to what the Court would permit in the name of wartime necessity, it was something less than a full or permanent flight from Cicero.<br><br>&#x201c;the political thicket&#x201d;<br><br>The doctrine of the &#x201c;political question&#x201d; is more specific and better developed than Cicero&#x2019;s maxim as crisis jurisprudence, but as applied to questions of national security, it is nonetheless in the same spirit. It provides a technical legal basis for courts to refuse to consider the lawfulness of presidential action taken pursuant to either his wartime or his foreign affairs powers. Indeed, by walling off many of the President&#x2019;s wartime and foreign affairs decisions from review, it is but one step removed from Cicero.<br><br>The doctrine says that in certain instances, the Constitution gives not to the courts but to other branches of government the power to decide whether an action violates the Constitution. In this way, the laws, including the Constitution, do not necessarily fall &#x201c;silent.&#x201d; They still apply to the government action in question. But it is for Congress or the President, not the courts, to determine what the law requires given the national security threat.<br><br>The doctrine has a venerable provenance. In 1803 Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in Marbury v. Madison: &#x201c;By the constitution of the United States, the president is invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience.&#x201d;20<br><br>The Court has since invoked the doctrine in both wartime and foreign relations cases. During the War of 1812, for example, the President called up the New York State militia for service. Jacob Mott, a member of the militia, refused to comply. He was court-�martialed and convicted of refusing to report for duty. He appealed, and his case came to the Supreme Court.21<br><br>Mott conceded that the Constitution gives Congress the power to &#x201c;provide for calling forth the militia, to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.&#x201d;22 He agreed that Congress had enacted a statute stating that<br><br>whenever the United States shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe, it shall be lawful for the President of the United States to call forth such number of the militia of the State or States most convenient to the place of danger, or scene of action, as he may judge necessary to repel such invasion.23<br><br>But, Mott argued, the President had failed to establish the presence of an &#x201c;imminent danger of invasion.&#x201d; Hence he had not met the statutory requirement. And since the Constitution gave him no independent power to call up the militia, Mott argued his call-�up was impermissible.24<br><br>The Court rejected Mott&#x2019;s claim, not because it agreed with the President about the risk of invasion, but because it thought this risk was the kind of question that the Constitution denied the Court the power to decide. Justice Joseph Story wrote that<br><br>the power to call the militia into actual service is certainly felt to be one of no ordinary magnitude. But . . . it is, in its terms, a limited power, confined to cases of actual invasion, or of imminent danger of invasion. . . . [I]s it to be considered as an open question . . . to be contested by every militia-�man who shall refuse to obey the orders of the President? We are all of opinion, that the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen, belongs exclusively to the President, and that his decision is conclusive upon all other persons.25<br><br>The Court further developed the &#x201c;political question&#x201d; doctrine during the 1840s, in a case concerning the government of Rhode Island.26 The petitioners had argued that the new state constitution&#x2014;�under which their rivals had claimed authority and called upon the federal government for military support&#x2014;�violated the federal Constitution&#x2019;s guarantee of a &#x201c;republican form of government.&#x201d;27 But the Supreme Court held that the matter was a &#x201c;political question,&#x201d; grounding its decision in the idea that the political branches should have unfettered power over national security matters. Referring back to Mott&#x2019;s case, Chief Justice Taney explained why the Court could not second-�guess a determination by Congress or the President as to the legitimacy of a state&#x2019;s government:<br><br>After the President has acted and called out the militia [in support of one group alleging to be the true state government], is a Circuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire whether his decision was right? Could the court, while the parties were actually contending in arms for the possession of the government, call witnesses before it and inquire which party represented a majority of the people? If it could, then it would become the duty of the court (provided it came to the conclusion that the President had decided incorrectly) to discharge those who were arrested or detained by the troops in the service of the United States or the government which the President was endeavoring to maintain. If the judicial power extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and not of order.28<br><br>The same theme would be expounded by the Court into the twentieth century, in Chicago &amp; Southern Airlines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., a case involving the award of an international airline route.29 A statute had given the courts the power to review route awards to airlines by the Civil Aeronautics Board. The Court, however, held that this power did not apply when the President himself had approved the final decision. That is because, as Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote, the<br><br>President, both as Commander-�in-�Chief and as the Nation&#x2019;s organ for foreign affairs, has available intelligence services whose reports neither are nor ought to be published to the world. It would be intolerable that courts, without the relevant information, should review and perhaps nullify actions of the Executive taken on information properly held secret. Nor can courts sit in camera in order to be taken into executive confidences. But even if courts could require full disclosure, the very nature of executive decisions as to foreign policy is political, not judicial. Such decisions are wholly confided...</p><h2>What the Dormouse Said: How the 60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer</h2><p>An analysis of the political and cultural forces that gave rise to the personal computer chronicles its development through the people, politics, and social upheavals that defined its time, from a teenage anti-war protester who laid the groundwork for the PC revolution to the imprisoned creator of the first word processing software for the IBM PC. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Thanks to the cunning of history and the wondrous strangeness of Northern California, the utopian counterculture, psychedelic drugs, military hardware and antimilitary software were tangled together inextricably in the prehistory of the personal computer.

The unlikely thief is Benjamin Ziskind, a thirty-year-old quiz-show writer. As Benjamin and his twin sister try to evade the police, they find themselves recalling their dead parents&#x2014;the father who lost a leg in Vietnam, the mother who created children's books&#x2014;and their stories about trust, loss, and betrayal.<br><br>What is true, what is fake, what does it mean? Eighty years before the theft, these questions haunted Chagall and the enigmatic Yiddish fabulist Der Nister ("The Hidden One"), teachers at a school for Jewish orphans. Both the painting and the questions will travel through time to shape the Ziskinds' futures.<br><br>With astonishing grace and simplicity, Dara Horn interweaves a real art heist, history, biography, theology, and Yiddish literature. Richly satisfying, utterly unique, her novel opens the door to "the world to come"&#x2014;not life after death, but the world we create through our actions right now.</p><p>Following in the footsteps of her breakout debut <i>In the Image</i>, Dara Horn's second novel, <i>The World to Come</i>, is an intoxicating combination of mystery, spirituality, redemption, piety, and passion. Using a real-life art heist as her starting point, Horn traces the life and times of several characters, including Russian-born artist Marc Chagall, the New Jersey-based Ziskind family, and the "already-weres" and "not-yets" who roam an eternal world that exists outside the boundaries of life on earth. <p> At the center of the story is Benjamin Ziskind, a former child prodigy who now spends his days writing questions for a television trivia show. After Ben's twin sister Sara forces him to attend a singles cocktail party at a Jewish museum, Ben spots <i>Over Vitebsk</i>, a Chagall sketch that once hung in the twins' childhood home.

It's a cold case, but for Detective Harry Bosch, it stirs up memories of his childhood as an orphan. He can't let it go. As the investigation takes Bosch deeper into the past, a beautiful rookie cop brings him alive in the present. No official warning can break them apart--or prepare Bosch for the explosions when the case takes a few hard turns. Suddenly all of L.A. is in an uproar, and Bosch, fighting to keep control, is driven to the brink of an unimaginable decision.</strong></p><p>Since his first appearance in 1992's Edgar-winning <i>The Black Echo</i>, Detective Hieronymous "Harry" Bosch has joined Dennis Lehane's Patrick and Angie, George Pelecanos's Derek Strange, and Greg Rucka's Atticus Kodiak in the pantheon of new-school hard-boiled detectives. Rather than giving Bosch a clever gimmick (like Jeffery Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme, who is a quadriplegic), Michael Connelly embraces the noir archetype: Bosch, an L.A. homicide detective, is a chain-smoking loner who refuses to play by his superiors' rules. Although he has quit smoking, Harry's still the same tightlipped outsider, taking each crime as a personal affront as he tries to cleanse his beloved city of the darkness he sees engulfing it. <p> In <i>City of Bones</i>, Connelly's eighth Bosch title, Bosch and his well-dressed partner, Jerry Edgar, are working to identify a child's skeleton, buried for 20 years in the forest off Hollywood's Wonderland Drive, and to bring the killer to belated justice. For Bosch this is more than just another homicide, as the mystery child, beaten and abandoned, comes to represent much of what he sees as evil in his city. Add in a tragic love affair with a fellow cop, complications from overzealous media, and the growing feeling that he's fighting a losing battle about which no one cares, and the usually stoic Bosch is pushed to his limits. This isn't the strongest plot Connelly has concocted for Bosch, but it leads to an ending the whole series has been building toward. The conclusion may not shock longtime fans, but it will leave them wondering where the series will go from here. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p>Michael Connelly is a former journalist and author of over twenty books, including the bestselling Harry Bosch series. His novels Blood Work and The Lincoln Lawyer have been made into major motion pictures. He has won numerous awards for his journalism, as well as an Edgar Award, a Nero Wolfe prize, a Macavity Award, an Anthony Award, and the 2009 Carvalho Prize for his books.

Despite an occasionally perceptible British bias, the authors have tried hard to paint a colorful, vivid picture of the many faces and varieties of English. The text is never dull, but is enlivened by innumerable examples and by interviews with representative individuals: a minister in Scotland, a couple from the Appalachians, a storekeeper in Newfoundland, a Philadelphia shoeshine man, a cockney fruitseller, an Australian farm family, the president of Sierra Leone, a writing professor in India.

At the beginning of the seventeenth century, however, Run's harvest of nutmeg turned it into the most lucrative of the Spice Islands, precipitating a fierce and bloody battle between the all-powerful Dutch East India Company and a small band of ragtag British adventurers led by the intrepid <b>Nathaniel Courthope</b>. The outcome of the fighting was one of the most spectacular deals in history: Britain ceded Run to Holland, but in return was given another small island, Manhattan.A brilliant adventure story of unthinkable hardship and savagery, the navigation of uncharted waters, and the exploitation of new worlds, <b>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</b> is a remarkable chapter in the history of the colonial powers.</p><p>Would you believe that nutmeg formed the basis of one of the most bitter international conflicts of the 17th century, and was also intimately connected to New York City's rise to global preeminence? Strange but true: nutmeg was, in fact, one of the most prized commodities in Renaissance Europe, and its fascinating story is told in Giles Milton's delightful <i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i>. <p> The book deals with the competition between England and Holland for possession of the spice-producing islands of Southeast Asia throughout the 17th century. Packed with stories of heroism, ambition, ruthlessness, treachery, murder, torture, and madness, <i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i> offers a compelling story of European rivalry in the tropics, thousands of miles from home, and the mutual incomprehensibility which often comically characterized relations between the Europeans and the local inhabitants of the prized islands.</p> <p> At the center of the action lies Nathaniel Courthope, a trusty lieutenant of the East India Company, who took and held the tiny nutmeg-producing island of Run in the face of overwhelming Dutch opposition for more than five years, before being treacherously murdered in 1620. To avenge his death, and the loss of the island, the British took the Dutch North American colony at Manhattan. (As Milton wittily remarks, although Courthope's death "robbed England of her nutmeg, it gave her the biggest of apples").</p> <p> Inevitably inviting comparisons with Dava Sobel's <i>Longitude</i>, <i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i> is a charming story that throws light on a neglected period of European history, and analyzes its fascination with the "spicy" East. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>Giles Milton</b> is the author of <b>The Riddle and the Knight</b>, a critically acclaimed history of the explorer <b>Sir John Mandeville</b>.</p><h2>Love You More</h2><p>One question, a split-second decision, and Brian Darby lies dead on the kitchen floor.

Or maybe a professor of Russian history. Instead he became a bestselling thriller writer, and winner of the International Thriller Writers Award for Best Novel for</em> Killer Instinct<em> and winner of the Barry and Gumshoe Awards for Best Thriller for </em>Company Man.<p></p> <p>I just took a break from writing my new book to read the latest by Lisa Gardner, who's one of the very few writers on my must-read list. Usually, when I'm deep into a novel, I read very little in the genre. But Lisa Gardner sent me an advance copy of <em>Love You More</em>, and I pretty much dropped everything and read it through the weekend.</p> <p>I've been a fan of Lisa's D.D. Warren series for some time, but she's truly outdone herself with this one. It grabs you on the first page and keeps you guessing until the final chapter, moving effortlessly between first person and third person narration, weaving an extraordinary amount of research into nonstop action.</p> <p><em>Love You More</em> starts with a crime we think we understand. Massachusetts State Trooper Tessa Leoni's husband Brian is dead in their kitchen, and Trooper Leoni has been beaten almost to death. It looks to everyone like a case of a battered wife defending herself at last. But Leoni's six-year-old daughter, Sophie, is missing, and the trooper's story is full of holes--holes that become even wider and more curious as Boston Police Detective Sergeant D.D. Warren and her old lover, friend and former partner Bobby Dodge investigate.</p> <p>Warren is dealing with issues of her own, as her relationship with Alex (who never appears in person in this installment) reaches a major turning point, one with implications for Warren's investigation and beyond. (I'm not going to give away what that is. You'll have to read it to find out for yourself.) The nature and power of Trooper Leoni's attachment to her daughter are central to this story: just how much does Leoni love her daughter, and to what lengths will she go to protect her? Is it possible that a mother so devoted could kill her own child?</p> <p>As Warren and Dodge follow the trail of clues, they uncover secrets at every turn: a terrible crime in Leoni's adolescence, a shameful secret of her husband's, and unimaginable betrayal among comrades and friends. Stakes escalate to a climax that is shocking, sad and deeply satisfying.</p> <p><em>Love You More</em> stands out in the crowded field of thrillers not only because it's a terrific book, but because it features two compelling and believable female protagonists. Trooper Leoni tells us her own story in the first person, alternating with the third-person narrative of Warren's investigation. Leoni's motives emerge over the course of the book, but her passion and conviction draw us in even before we know whether she's guilty or innocent. We cannot argue with her absolute drive, even as we root for Warren and Dodge to make sure justice is done. It's a remarkable juggling act that requires rare talent, and readers will be anxious for the next installment in D.D. Warren's adventures.</p> <p>I've noticed that a lot of guys have some kind of prejudice against thrillers written by women. Take my word for it: Lisa Gardner has the suspense chops to compete with Harlan Coben, Lee Child, and Michael Connelly. Anyone who's already read Tess Gerritsen, Karin Slaughter, Sandra Brown, or Mary Higgins Clark knows that some of the most gripping thrillers around are written by women.</p> <p>If you haven't yet discovered Lisa Gardner, now's the perfect time to start. <em>Love You More</em> is going to win her a legion of new fans and launch her right to the top of the lists along with Nora Roberts and Tami Hoag--and Stieg Larsson.</p> <p><strong>A Letter from Author Lisa Gardner</strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> True confession time: for a woman who makes her living writing extremely diabolical suspense novels, I have no stomach for gore. Scary movies? Can&#x2019;t watch them. Most of the crime shows on prime time? Egads, no way! Haunted houses? My husband has had to carry me out. It&#x2019;s embarrassing but true.<p></p> <p>So when I first received the invitation to conduct research at the famed Body Farm at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, I didn&#x2019;t know what to do with myself. As a forensics aficionado and thriller author, I just had to visit. A chance to learn first-hand how to search for buried remains? Or how to establish time of death for skeletal remains? Or the amount of forensic evidence that can still be retrieved from cremated bones? Sign me up!</p> <p>On the other hand, this would involve walking the fabled Death&#x2019;s Acre, which generally features several hundred decomposing bodies. I had to consider not just what I was going to see, but what I was going to smell, touch, feel. The squeamish mom in me worried I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to take it. And no one wants to be the one who barfs in front of trained professionals.</p> <p>What&#x2019;s a girl gonna do? Of course I went.</p> <p>The Anthropological Research Facility, aka the Body Farm, was founded in the early &#x2018;80s by Dr. William Bass. Up until then, the discovery of decomposed remains often led to a time of death plus or minus several years. Obviously, this complicated the homicide investigation. Dr. Bass&#x2019;s solution: bury a body, see how long it took to skelatonize, and scientifically establish a rate of decomp.</p> <p>Of course, many variables immediately came into play: buried or unburied, clothed or clothed, hot humid conditions, cold frosty conditions, animal activity, insect activity, etc., etc. In the end, Dr. Bass couldn&#x2019;t bury one body, he needed hundreds. Some donations were unclaimed remains from the ME&#x2019;s office. Hundreds of others are directed donations from people who wanted to contribute to the advancement of science after their death.</p> <p>This kind of generosity makes Death&#x2019;s Acre less a macabre wooded plot and more like hallowed ground. Instead of listening to anthropologists merely analyze body parts, I heard stories of people and families, of victims and criminal prosecutions, of crafty murderers and even craftier forensics experts. I learned of stories told in bone.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, the more the head anthropologist Dr. Lee Jantz humanized the remains we studied, the more bearable I found the sights and smells to be. When I cradled the feather-light cranial plate of a newborn infant in my hand, I could both marvel as its rose petal size and feel the weight of one parent&#x2019;s heart-breaking contribution. I was both mesmerized by the skeleton collection, which took up endless rows of metal shelves, and amazed by how a scientist such as Dr. Jantz could pick up a single piece of cremated bone and tell you the person&#x2019;s gender, approximate age, chronic health conditions and probable occupation.</p> <p>Bones, I learned, aren&#x2019;t just body parts, but an organic record of who we are, what we did, where we lived, and often, how we died. And in the right hands, bones allow the dead to speak. Think a murderer can cover his tracks with a burn barrel and lighter fluid? Think again. Think you can thwart time of death by freezing remains? Nope. Think you can get away with murder? Thanks to forensic anthropologists such as Dr. Jantz, not likely.</p> <p>I came to the Body Farm expecting to be immersed in death, and instead, found a new appreciation for life. And while my family still refuses to let me tell stories about my research over dinner, I had a great time working with the anthropologists on my March 2011 release Love You More. Just remember, when you come to the key scene in the snowy woods&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll know which one I&#x2019;m talking about&#x2014;I worked for that scene.</p> <p>I walked Death&#x2019;s Acre, and I never threw up.</p> <p></p><b>Lisa Gardner </b>is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of thirteen novels.

His endless crusades frustrated both businessman and politicians in Fort Worth, TX.&nbsp; Norris was also a publicity hound who was brash and abrasive.&nbsp; His enemies knew that he was a formidable foe.&nbsp; On July 17, 1926, Norris shot and killed an unarmed man in the church office.&nbsp; David Stokes's <i>The Shooting Salvationist </i>offers the complete story of&nbsp; the shooting, the criminal trial, and their aftermath&nbsp; Eighty-five years ago, this event captured the attention of the entire nation.&nbsp; Modern readers will likewise be enthralled by David Stokes's skillful presentation of this shocking crime.&nbsp; The story is simply incredible, yet every word is true. &nbsp;And you won't put this book down until reach the end!&nbsp; -- <b>Chris Rose, Andover Bookstore</b><br>&#x201c;For all the colorful characters who became part of Fort Worth&#x2019;s history, surely none surpassed J.

His oratory and penchant for publicity brought thousands into his congregation and at one point, First Baptist was among the largest churches in the world, a mega church before the phrase was coined. Unfortunately, for all his oratorical skills, Norris&#x2019; horizons were limited by several criminal indictments brought on by his tendency for violence.<br>In this book David Stokes tells the J.

In 1970, Borman went to work for Eastern Airlines, a company "riddled with inept management and uncaring unions," to eventually take over as president and CEO. His most difficult task: cutting labor costs. The book describes Eastern's prolonged, bitter struggle to remain independent, a management/labor fight Borman lost in 1986 when Eastern became part of Texas Air. The most impressive section of this highly readable autobiography, coauthored with novelist Sterling ( The President's Plane Is Missing ), is the depiction of Borman's confrontations with intransigent labor leaders and the dynamics of their negotiations. Also memorable is the tribute to Susan Borman's poignant struggle to be "the Perfect Wife married to the Perfect Husband who was the Perfect Astronaut in a Perfect American Family raising Perfect Children." Borman is now an aviation consultant.

Through a remarkable discovery linking Biblical alphabets to our genetic code, the "language of life" may now be read as the ancient letters of a timeless message. Regardless of race, religion, heritage or lifestyle, the message is the same in each cell of every woman, child and man, past and present. <p>With nearly one third of the world&#x2019;s nations currently embroiled in armed conflict, such proof of a universal bond offers compelling evidence that we are greater than any beliefs that have separated us in the past. Through this newly found expression of unity we find a place to begin when our differences seem insurmountable. </p><p>In this all-new original research, Gregg Braden shares the life-changing discovery that led him from a successful career in aerospace and defense to an extensive 12-year study of the most sacred and honored traditions of humankind. Through his global search and controversial findings: </p><p>� Discover the coded message of our cells from the day of our origins <br>� Experience that message as a universal principle of unity that makes war based in our differences obsolete <br>� See the recently revealed fragment of the Dead Sea Scrolls validating the text discovered in our cells <br>� Discover tangible and unprecedented evidence that we are part of a greater existence <br>� Learn how the message in your DNA becomes the foundation to resolve conflict; and offers a method, and a reason to believe that peace is possible within families and between nations</p></p><p>Author and computer systems designer Gregg Braden wrapped this entire book around the premise that God's name is literally encoded into every human body. According to Braden's logic, the basic elements of DNA--hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon--directly translate into specific letters of the Hebrew alphabets (YHVA), which then translate into the original name of God. Braden's hope is that knowing that God's signature is carried within each cell of the estimated six billion humans on earth will give humankind the evidence we need to overcome our differences and renew our faith: <p> </p><blockquote>Beyond Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Shinto, Native, Aboriginal, white, black, red, or yellow; man, woman, or child, the message reminds us that we are human. As humans, we share the same ancestors and exist as the children of the same Creator. In the moments that we doubt this one immutable truth, we need look no further than the cells of our body to be reminded. This is the power of the message within our cells. </blockquote> <p> One could argue that this melding of spirituality and science may be the next frontier in human evolution. Nonetheless, skeptics could also argue that this DNA=YHVA equation is an eerie coincidence, instead of a quantum breakthrough--like folding a $20 bill in a certain shape and seeing the twin towers in flames (Braden dispels such skepticism by asserting that the "odds that this relationship has occurred by chance are approximately 1 in 200,000"). This is neither a consistent or easy read. Some passages are filled with dense, analytical stretches of cross referencing ancient texts with modern science. Others are more prosaic as Braden explains his beautifully optimistic hope for peace on Earth. --<i>Gail Hudson</i></p>New York Times bestselling author Gregg Braden has been a featured guest at international conferences and media specials, exploring the role of spirituality in technology. A former senior computer systems designer (Martin Marietta Aerospace), computer geologist (Phillips Petroleum), and technical operations supervisor (Cisco Systems), Braden is now considered a leading authority on bridging the wisdom of our past with the science, technology, and peace of our future. <p>His journeys into the remote mountain villages, monasteries, and temples of times past, coupled with his background in the hard sciences, uniquely qualify him to bring the benefit of long-lost traditions to the forefront of our lives today. </p><p>From his controversial book The Isaiah Effect, ISBN: 060980796X; the groundbreaking, Awakening to Zero Point, ISBN: 1889071099; and his pioneering work in Walking Between the Worlds, ISBN: 1889071056; Gregg Braden ventures beyond the traditional boundaries of science and spirituality, offering meaningful solutions to the challenges of our time.

It is thought that prehistoric people saw marshland as sacred. Because it is neither land nor sea but a mixture of both, they saw it as a kind of bridge to the afterlife--neither land nor sea, neither life nor death. This is why they often buried treasure, or even bodies, at the edge of marshland. There have been several discoveries of so-called bog bodies, prehistoric bodies preserved in peaty marshland soil. The most famous of these is probably Tollund Man, discovered in Denmark in 1950. Tollund Man, who dates from the Iron Age, was hanged before being thrown into a peat bog. Was he a sacrifice to the gods, an offering in return for safe passage across the treacherous ground? No one really knows.</p> <p>Norfolk is on the east coast of England. Less than ten thousand years ago, this land would have been part of the European landmass, now Scandinavia. It's no wonder, then, that Norse belief was strong in the area. My story is fictional but there have been many real-life archaeological discoveries on the Norfolk coast. At Holme-next-the-Sea, a wooden henge was discovered, believed to date from the Bronze Age. At the center of the henge circle was a tree, planted upside down. Was this Yggdrasil, the world tree of Norse legend? The tree on which Odin was sacrificed for the good of mankind? Again, no one knows.

C. Beaton</b> has won international acclaim for her bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries and the Agatha Raisin mystery series. She is also the author of more than one hundred romance titles and a series of romantic suspense novels, the Edwardian Mystery series. Born in Scotland, she now divides her time between Paris and the English Cotswolds.</p>From the always sunny Beaton comes this Christmas special of a book featuring policeman Hamish Macbeth (Death of an Addict, etc.) and two minor Yuletide mysteries. In the fishing village of Lochdubh, Christmas looms, but there are no decorations or Christmas trees as the conservative Calvinist population declines to decorate. The lanky and amiable Hamish is told to cover the beat of a neighboring town, Cnothan, as well, where someone has made off with not only the village Christmas lights but also the huge tree. Back in Lochdubh, crusty loner Mrs. Gallagher reports that her beloved cat, Smoky, has been stolen. While investigating, Hamish meets the attractive new schoolteacher, Maisie Pease, who quickly decides she'd like to help Hamish forget his previous love interest, Priscilla Halburton-Smythe. As Hamish works on the two cases, he also makes the acquaintance of the Andersons, a strict and reserved couple whose daughter, Morag, longs for a traditional Christmas. In this mystery without a murder, Beaton reintroduces familiar characters like the spinster Curry sisters and local seer Angus Macdonald, while working in newcomers such as Maisie. It's light fun throughout, though all but Beaton's die-hard readers will find this Christmas carol too cozy by half.

Bringing into focus the high drama of their World Series appearances from 1962 to 1972 and their pivotal games, Michael Leahy explores these men&#x2019;s interpersonal relationships and illuminates the triumphs, agonies, and challenges each faced individually.</p><p>Leahy places these men&#x2019;s lives within the political and social maelstrom that was the era when the conformity of the 1950s gave way to demands for equality and rights. Increasingly frustrated over a lack of real bargaining power and an iron-fisted management who occasionally meddled in their personal affairs, many players shared an uneasy relationship with the team&#x2019;s front office. This contention mirrored the discord and uncertainty generated by myriad changes rocking the nation: the civil rights movement, political assassinations, and growing hostility to the escalation of the Vietnam War. While the nation around them changed, these players each experienced a personal and professional metamorphosis that would alter public perceptions and their own.</p><p>Comprehensive and artfully crafted, <em>The Last Innocents</em> is an evocative and riveting portrait of a pivotal era in baseball and modern America.</p></p><p><p>It&#x2019;s rare for a team to encapsulate an era as indelibly as the Los Angeles Dodgers did the 1960s.

Outside the public eye, these seven Dodgers&#x2014;friends, mentors, and confidants&#x2014;struggled to understand their place in society and in a sport controlled by owners whose wishes were fiat. Even as they starred in games watched by millions, they coped with anxieties and indignities their fans knew nothing about&#x2014;some of their wounds deeply personal, others more common to the times, though no less painful.

In <i>H Is for Hawk</i>, you will meet Mabel, not your typical bloodthirsty specimen, as she is trained to hunt like the goshawks of yore. It is this brash, slightly mad undertaking that wrenches Macdonald free from despair, and brings her to a place where she can begin again. Doesn&#x2019;t sound like your kind of thing? You&#x2019;d be surprised. Macdonald&#x2019;s gorgeously wrought prose holds you in thrall from the first page, and provides something akin to the escape, and salvation, that nature provides her. In &#x2018;Hawk&#x2019; you will also learn about the famed Arthurian novelist T.H. White, a kindred soul to Macdonald in certain ways. One of the things that endeared him to her was his &#x201c;childish delight&#x201d; with all things wild, something you&#x2019;ll be hard-pressed not to experience as soon as you tap into this tome. <i>&#x2013;Erin Kodicek</i></p>HELEN MACDONALD is a writer, poet, illustrator, historian and affiliate at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge.

Here, amid the weariness of life in the country, the famous actress Arkadina presides over a household riven with desperate love, with dreams of success and dread of failure. It is her son, Konstantin, who one day shoots a seagull; it is the novelist Trigorin who will one day write the story of the seagull so casually killed; but it is Nina, the seagull herself, whose life to come will rewrite the story. </p><p>This new translation of <i>The Seagull</i>--made by Tom Stoppard for the Peter Hall Company at the Old Vic in 1997--was produced by The Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival in New York City in 2001.

Their glamorous presence not only disrupts the performance but soon takes on a more profound significance for the lives of all those present.

It is ages 4-14 that make up the second act, as Catherine Newman puts it in this delightfully candid, outlandishly funny new memoir about the years that "your children will remember as childhood." Following Newman's son and daughter as they blossom from preschoolers into teenagers, CATASTROPHIC HAPPINESS is about the bittersweet joy of raising children--and the ever-evolving landscape of issues parents traverse. In a laugh out-loud, heart-wrenching, relatable voice, Newman narrates events as momentous as grief and as quietly moving as the moonlit face of a sleeping child. From tantrums and friendship to fear and even sex, Newman's fresh take will appeal to any parent riding this same roller coaster of laughter and heartbreak.</p><p>Catherine Newman is the author of the memoir <i>Waiting For Birdy</i>. She is the etiquette columnist for <i>Real Simple</i> magazine, a regular contributor to the <i>New York Times</i> Motherlode blog, and editor-in-chief of the James Beard Award winning kids cooking magazine<i> ChopChop</i>. She lives in Amherst, Massachusetts with her family.<b>Praise for <i>Catastrophic Happiness<br><br></i></b>"Ultimately the most fascinating character isn't her family, but Newman herself. This is because <b>the book's force lies</b> not in what it tells us about parenting, but <b>in its sensitive portrayal of the blurring of self that happens after one has children</b>. . . For Newman, this question of where she begins and ends is less of a riddle than a Buddhist koan. Wisely, she never tries to solve it. <b>Her goal, in parenting and in writing, is only to figure out how to love from within it."</b>&#x2015;<b>Elissa Strauss</b>, <b><i>New York Times Book Review<br></i></b><br><br>"Part of what makes Ms. Newman so good is her butterfly prose, colorful and light on its feet; part of it is her marvelous ability to reassure. It's affirming for parents to see their lives reflected back at them, and in a theme-park fun house no less, with all of the dreary bits made stretchy and silly. I adore her sideways sense of humor."<br>&#x2015;<b>Jennifer Senior</b>, <b><i>New York Times<br></i></b><br><br>"In writing that comes close to poetry, Newman really does manage to capture this bittersweet side of parenting, without overemphasizing either the bitter or the sweet. It's the two together that epitomize the job of raising and loving people who are destined to grow up and leave you, and her ability to see this that makes this book so uniquely good."&#x2015;<b>Malena Watrous</b>, <b><i>San Francisco Chronicle<br></i></b><br><br>"This is a book about mothers and children, or really, about how the job of mothering changes a woman, inevitably, irrevocably, and sometimes uncomfortably. Newman's self-awareness is what makes the book work; it's a portrait of striving toward a perfection that never existed, while loving the imperfection that surrounds us." <br>&#x2015;<b>Kate Tuttle</b>, <b><i>Boston Globe<br></i></b><br><br>"Winsome and funny."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>People Magazine<br></i></b><br><br>"An intimate account about the hectic joy of raising children and embracing the silver lining of all those inevitable hair-pulling-out mom moments."&#x2015;<b><i>Glamour.com</i></b><br><br>"<i>Catastrophic Happiness</i> celebrates the absurdly lovely mess of the parenting years."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>More <br></i></b><br><br><b><i></i></b>"You know those taunting posts that promise to make you "feel all the feels" only to leave you annoyed and let down?

Dick</h2><p>Philip K. Dick was a master of science fiction, but he was also a writer whose work transcended genre to examine the nature of reality and what it means to be human. A writer of great complexity and subtle humor, his work belongs on the shelf of great twentieth-century literature, next to Kafka and Vonnegut. Collected here are twenty-one of Dick's most dazzling and resonant stories, which span his entire career and show a world-class writer working at the peak of his powers. <br><br>In "The Days of Perky Pat," people spend their time playing with dolls who manage to live an idyllic life no longer available to the Earth's real inhabitants. "Adjustment Team" looks at the fate of a man who by mistake has stepped out of his own time. In "Autofac," one community must battle benign machines to take back control of their lives. And in "I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon," we follow the story of one man whose very reality may be nothing more than a nightmare. The collection also includes such classic stories as "The Minority Report," the basis for the Steven Spielberg movie, and "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale," the basis for the film Total Recall. Selected Stories of Philip K.

The modern concept of hell and damnation owes everything to this work, and it is the rock upon which vernacular Italian was built. Its influence is woven into the very fabric of Western imagination, and poets, painters, scholars, and translators return to it endlessly.<br><br>This new verse translation (with facing-page Italian text) by internationally famed scholar and master teacher Robert Hollander and his wife, poet Jean Hollander, is a unique collaboration that combines the virtues of maximum readability with complete fidelity to the original Italian-and to Dante's intentions and subtle shadings of meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book reflects Robert Hollander's faultless Dante scholarship and his nearly four decades' teaching experience at Princeton. The introduction, notes, and commentary on the poem cannot be matched for their depth of learning and usefulness for the lay reader. In addition, the book matches the English and Italian text on the Web site of the Princeton Dante Project, which also offers a voiced Italian reading, fuller-scale commentaries, and links to a database of some sixty Dante commentaries. <br><br><b>The Inferno</b> opens the glories of Dante's epic wider for English speakers than any previous translation, and provides the interpretative apparatus for ever-deeper excursions into its endless layers of meaning and implication. It is truly a Dante for the new millennium.</p><p>Translation is always an imperfect art, demanding from its practitioners a level of dual fidelity that even a seasoned bigamist would envy. And no work of art has prompted more in the way of earnest imperfection than Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>. Transforming those intricate, rhyme-rich tercets into English has been the despair of many a distinguished translator, from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to W.S. Merwin (whose estimable rendition of <i>Purgatorio</i> found the poet rattling over more than one linguistic speed bump). Now comes a fresh rendition of the <i>Inferno</i> from a husband-and-wife team. Robert Hollander, who has taught Dante for nearly four decades at Princeton, supplies the scholarly muscle, while his wife, poet Jean Hollander, attends to the verbal music.<p> How does their collaboration stack up? In his introduction, Robert Hollander is quick to acknowledge his debt to John D. Sinclair's prose trot of 1939, and to the version that Charles Singleton derived largely from his predecessor's in 1970. Yet the Hollanders have done us all a favor by throwing Sinclair's faux medievalisms overboard. And their predilection for direct, monosyllabic English sometimes brings them much closer to Dante's asperity and rhythmic urgency. One example will suffice. In the last line of Canto V, after listening to Francesca's adulterous aria, the poet faints: "<i>E caddi come corpo morto cade</i>." Sinclair's rendering---"I swooned as if in death and dropped like a dead body"--has a kind of conditional mushiness to it. Compare the punchier rendition from the Hollanders: "And down I fell as a dead body falls." It sounds like an actual line of English verse, which is the least we can do for the supreme poet of our beleaguered civilization.</p><p> Robert Hollander has also supplied an extensive and very welcome commentary. There are times, perhaps, when he might have broken ranks with his academic ancestors: why not deviate from Giorgio Petrocchi's 1967 edition of the Italian text when he thinks that the great scholar was barking up the wrong tree? In any case, the Hollanders' <i>Inferno</i> is a fine addition to the burgeoning bookshelf of Dante in English. It won't displace the relatively recent verse translations by Robert Pinsky or Allen Mandelbaum, and even John Ciardi's version, which sometimes substitutes breeziness for accuracy, can probably hold its own here. But when it comes to high fidelity and exegetical generosity, this <i>Inferno</i> burns brightly indeed. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>&#x201c;The most accessible and the closest to the Italian...with ample commentary easily and unobtrusively available at the end of each Canto.&#x201d;&#x2013;Tim Parks, <i>The New Yorker<br></i><br>&#x201c;The Hollanders...act as latter-day Virgils, guiding us through the Italian text that is printed on the facing page.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>The Economist<br><br></i>&#x201c;Probably the most finely accomplished and may well prove the most enduring.... The annotation...is crowded with useful insights and bits of information and keeps us abreast of scholarly opinion across the ages.&#x201d;&#x2013;R.W.B.

Europe's past is littered with states and kingdoms, large and small, that are scarcely remembered today, and while their names may be unfamiliar-Aragon, Etruria, the Kingdom of the Two Burgundies-their stories should change our mental map of the past. We come across forgotten characters and famous ones-King Arthur and Macbeth, Napoleon and Queen Victoria, right up to Stalin and Gorbachev-and discover how faulty memory can be, and how much we can glean from these lost empires.

The author will gather a wide variety of first-person accounts that are not generally available elsewhere, relying primarily on unpublished manuscript accounts and contemporaneous newspaper articles. Each article covering an event or battle will be placed within its context, with background information on the author of the article, a historical introduction evaluating the article&#39;s accuracy and significance, and a &#34;for further reading&#34; list of sources.</p><p>Peter Cozzens is a Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Department of State and the author of several acclaimed books on the Civil War and Western history, including The Civil War in the West (0-252-02236-X) and General John Pope: A Life for the Nation (0-252-02363-3).Prolific author Cozzens (The Civil War in the West) has assembled a collection of contemporaneous accounts of the military campaigns against the Apache Indians in the American Southwest in this first of five volumes about the Indian Wars. The materials include army reports, diaries of participants, periodical articles, and newspaper accounts. All were selected on the basis of the writers' involvement and their lack of easy availability elsewhere. The result is a comprehensive, albeit disjointed, account of the Apache Wars. Background information on the people and events is adequate, and references for additional reading are given. Lacking are maps designed to orient the reader to the various campaigns, and some of the editorial notes would have been more useful had they been included in the text.

Kertzer is the author of, among other books, Prisoner of the Vatican, The Popes Against the Jews, and The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara, winner of the National Jewish Book Award and a finalist for the National Book Award. He is provost of Brown University and professor of anthropology and Italian studies.Introduction: Italys Birth and Near Demise Modern Italy, it could be said, was founded over the dead body of Pope Pius IX. Although Italy had been a geographical label since Roman times, the idea that a distinctive Italian people inhabited the boot-shaped peninsula and its islands was more recent, and the notion that they should have an independent state of their own more recent still. Only with the French Revolutions attack on the principles of absolutism and divinely ordained hierarchy could such an idea gain ground, and only with the rise of nationalism as the political creed of the nineteenth century could &#34;Italy for the Italians&#34; become the new watchword. But creating a sense of common Italian identity among the people of the peninsula was no easy matter. Not only were they not accustomed to being part of the same country, few of them spoke Italian, 97 percent speaking a kaleidoscope of dialects and languages that were in good part mutually unintelligible. In the aftermath of Napoleons defeat in 1814, the Italian nationalist movement faced a peninsula that was divided into a patchwork of states and duchies propped up by foreign forces, the Austrian empire foremost among them. But the nationalists were not entirely discouraged, for they knew that autocratic mini-states were vulnerable to the wrath of their subjects from within and to armies from without. Assorted dukes and kings had painfully learned the latter lesson when Napoleons armies had, not many years earlier, swept through the peninsula and deposed them all. For Italys nationalists, then, the most daunting obstacle was not the Austrian occupation of northeastern It- aly, nor the tottering Bourbon monarchy that ruled all of the South and Sicily, nor the assorted dukes and their duchies. No, there was a far greater power, a far more imposing foe, one that cut the peninsula in two, blocking North from South, its capital the legendary city of Romulus and Remus, the symbol of Italys ancient greatness. For more than a thousand years the popes had ruled over these Papal States, a swath of territory that extended from Rome northward through Umbria and the Marches to Ferrara and Bologna. Deposing the duke of Modena or the grandduke of Tuscany, or even driving the Austrians out of Lombardy and Veneto, was one thing. Deposing the pope from his thousand-year earthly reign was something very different, for the pope, though having little in the way of military might, had weapons that no other ruler could ever hope to wield. What the pope had was the belief - enshrined in official Church dogma and pronounced by parish priests throughout the land - that he ruled over a divinely ordained kingdom as Gods representative on earth. The creation of a unified Italian state, the pope insisted - and in this he had centuries of Church teachings to back him up - was contrary to Gods wishes. It could only be accomplished by force, and anyone taking part in such an assault would be throwing in h</p><h2>The Holmes Manual</h2><p><p><strong>No-nonsense advice from the star of HGTV&#x2019;s <em>Holmes Makes It Right</em> and <em>Holmes Inspection</em></strong></p><ul> <li>Why are my windows fogging up?</li> <li>What can I do about a squeaky floor?</li> <li>Why is my bedroom so much colder than the rest of the house?</li> <li>Are tankless water heaters worth the money?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>From top to bottom, outside to inside, Mike answers homeowners&#x2019; most common questions and provides solutions for everyday problems.

He lives in Oxford, Mississippi.1<br><br> Lillie Virgil stood high on a north Mississippi hill at daybreak listening to old Ruthie Holder talk about the man who'd run off with her grandson's Kawasaki four-wheeler and her brand-new twelve-gauge Browning. Ruthie said she'd just gotten home from the Piggly Wiggly with a week's worth of groceries when this skinny, bucktoothed varmint jumped out of the bushes and started in with a lot of crazy talk.<br><br> "What exactly did he say, Miss Holder?"<br><br> "He told me that the g.d. Mexican cartel was in my kitchen making chorizo and eggs and if I walked inside they'd have their way with me," she said. "I told him it was a lot of foolish talk, but he insisted on going in without me. Next thing I knew, he was running out with my Browning and headed to the shed."<br><br> Lillie reached down and lowered the volume on the police radio. She was tall, with an athlete's lean muscles and lots of crazy light brown hair she kept neat in a bun and under a ball cap. That day, she wore gold aviator glasses, a Glock 19 on her hip, and chewed gum, as she asked, "Have you ever seen this asshole before?"<br><br> "This man wasn't wearing a shirt or shoes, just a pair of ragged old Levi's," Ruthie Holder said. "He had a tattoo of Hank Williams Junior on his back. Do you think I'd ever consort with trash like that?"<br><br> "No, ma'am," Lillie said. Ruthie ran the Citizens Bank for years, served as president of the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and still offered her harp-playing skills to local weddings and funerals. Lillie didn't think she even knew "All My Rowdy Friends" or "Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound."<br><br> "I sure love that gun," Ruthie said. "I won it in a raffle. And since my husband died, it gave me a lot of comfort."<br><br> "Understand that," Lillie said. "I feel the same way about the Winchester I had at Ole Miss. I won a lot of tournaments with her."<br><br> "Her?" Ruthie said. "Didn't know a gun could be a woman."<br><br> Lillie smiled and shrugged. Standing tall, feeling good after running five miles that morning, finishing it off with a hundred push-ups and a hundred sit-ups. If she was going to watch over Tibbehah County in the years to come, better be in shape. "Makes complete sense to me," she said. "What'd this man look like and which way did he head?"<br><br> "He was ugly."<br><br> "Yes, ma'am," Lillie said. "But can you be more specific, Mrs. Holder?"<br><br> "Skinny and rangy. Black hair, but shaved down," she said. "Wore an earring. And had thin little hairs sprouting on his chin. Like some kind of animal. What does all that matter? How many folks do you know riding four-wheelers without shirts and sporting a tattoo of Hank Junior?"<br><br> Lillie grinned at her. "In this county?" she asked. "About every other son of a bitch."<br><br> Lillie told her they'd find him, already knowing they were looking for an authentic piece of crap named David John Norwood. She'd arrested Norwood for aggravated assault and drug possession a few weeks after becoming acting sheriff, back when the newly elected sheriff Rusty Wise got himself killed. Norwood only got probation and was left to raise hell and stir shit across the county as he pleased.<br><br> Lillie climbed into her Jeep Cherokee with its big gold star on the door, grabbed the mic, and called in to Mary Alice at dispatch. "Can you get me D. J. Norwood's parole officer?" she said.<br><br> "Oh, Lord," Mary Alice said. "What's that boy done now?"<br><br> "Same old shit," Lillie said. "Lost his fucking mind. Also get me Jimmy Deets over at Wildlife. I think Norwood's headed way, way off road and into the Big Woods."<br><br> "Which direction?"<br><br> "Headed north," Lillie said. "I say he's going into the National Forest, looking for the Trace."<br><br> "Why?"<br><br> "Probably because he wants to be with the rest of the animals," she said. "Let Deets know he is armed, dangerous, and crazy as hell."<br><br> Lillie Virgil knocked her Cherokee in gear, following the muddy ATV tracks until they hit a dirt road into the hills. The back wheels of the Jeep spun out dirt and gravel before finding solid footing. She lowered the window and listened, chewing gum, rifle in the passenger seat at her side.<br><br> So you were a cheerleader?� Fannie Hathcock asked the young girl sitting in a chair in front of her.<br><br> "Yes, ma'am."<br><br> "Don't 'Yes, ma'am' me or I won't ever give you a job," Fannie said. "Just how old do you think I am?"<br><br> "I don't know," the girl said. She shuffled in her seat and glanced away. "Hate to say."<br><br> "But old," Fannie said. "You think I'm over-the-hill? Too old to show my goodies to fat old truckers?"<br><br> "I didn't mean nothing by it," the girl said. "I just was trying to be respectful, is all. You dress real nice. Smell good. And you own your own place."<br><br> Fannie smoothed down the lace on her white Valentino skirt, black shirt open wide at the throat. She wore a bright ruby in the shape of a heart on a chain around her neck. "You like it better than the old place?"<br><br> "I never saw the old place," the girl said. "My dad used to go there. When he'd go on a drunk with his uncle and them. My mom said it was against God. But she's always saying things like that."<br><br> Fannie, a true and authentic redhead cap to cat, rested her butt-nice and tight, for a woman in her forties-on the edge of her desk. Her office door was open, and from where she looked over the girl's shoulder she could get a good bird's-eye view of the floor of Vienna's. Vienna's Place is what she'd rechristened the renovated space of a true Mississippi shithole called the Booby Trap. Vienna was Fannie's grandmother, the woman who taught her the Golden Rule-Men will do anything for pussy. Vienna sure had made her rich.<br><br> Fannie tapped at a Dunhill box and lifted a small brown cigarillo into her mouth and looked down at the girl. Bleached blonde hair, a dull, freckled face, and one piercing in her nose and one in the tongue. She also had a streak of black in the blonde. Girl said she was eighteen, but Fannie would need to see some ID. That's the last thing she needed-trouble with the law over damn Southern jailbait.<br><br> "You know some tricks?" Fannie said.<br><br> "Excuse me?"<br><br> "I don't mean your twat, baby," she said. "I mean with all the cheerleading. Flips, tumbling. A damn naked handstand."<br><br> "I was a flyer."<br><br> "What the hell's a flyer?"<br><br> "I was on top," the girl said. "Bigger girls would lift me up and toss me into the air."<br><br> "Nobody will toss you around here," Fannie said. "We look out for our girls. Nobody gets hurt. I'm not Johnny Fucking Stagg."<br><br> "I hear the money is real good."<br><br> "It is," Fannie said, spewing smoke from the side of her mouth. "But the house gets forty percent. And you need to tip your bouncer and the DJ every damn night. You need to get straight with that right off."<br><br> The girl's freckled face dropped. She looked down at her stubby little fingers, with black nail polish, probably thinking that she could keep all that trucker cash as long as she showed off those perky young boobies and shook that smooth, shaved tail.<br><br> "OK," the girl said. "When can I start?"<br><br> "When can you show me some ID?"<br><br> The young girl opened up her purse. She had on a short pink T-shirt, cutoff jeans, and cheap brown boots inlaid with cactuses and cowboys. She showed her ID. Looked to be she was telling the truth.<br><br> "Ever get nekkid?" Fannie said.<br><br> "Sure."<br><br> "For money?"<br><br> The girl shrugged.<br><br> "All of it flashing and jiggling on a hot white stage," Fannie said. "With nasty old truckers and gray-headed perverts wanting to lick you like a damn ice cream cone."<br><br> "I can do it."<br><br> "Lap dance is forty bucks," Fannie said. "I never minded the grind. But I sure minded the smell."<br><br> "What if they mess with you?" the girl said, looking Fannie full on in the eye now. "What if they're wanting to touch you and all?"<br><br> "They can touch up top all they want, but never below," Fannie said. "One of them wants to start dialing home with his digits, you just make sure Lyle knows."<br><br> The girl looked confused. "Who's Lyle?"<br><br> "Runs a group of Bad News Bears around here called the Born Losers," she said. "They ride bikes and raise hell out of the motel across the street. The Golden Cherry. When they're not too drunk or stoned, they offer us some protection. That's the other rule-Don't mess with the bikers. They're hired help."<br><br> "Yes, ma'am."<br><br> "God damn it."<br><br> "Sorry."<br><br> Fannie smiled while the smoke scattered from the office and out into the big open space of Vienna's. Ceiling fans broke it apart. She'd taken down old Johnny's place to the studs and built it back up, with a new tin roof, heart pine floors, and a long old bar she'd had shipped piece by piece from Kansas City, Missouri. Fannie "Belle" Hathcock had just upped the class in this north Mississippi town by a hundred and fifty percent.<br><br> "Whatta you say, girl?" Fannie said.<br><br> "Forty percent?"<br><br> "Let me know if you find better job opportunities in Jericho," Fannie said. "I heard they're hiring a fry cook down at the Sonic."<br><br> In his previous life as the go-to Hollywood stuntman, Quinn Colson�s dad, Jason, must�ve landed on his head a few times. Ever since he�d come back to Jericho, he�d been filled with all kinds of crazy ideas, schemes, and various delusions. There was a kids� go-cart track he wanted to open in the parking lot of the old Kentucky Fried Chicken, or bring a Hooters to the people of Tibbehah County-he knew some people in Memphis who�d back him-and, lately, he�d been talking about turning Quinn�s farm into a dude ranch.<br><br> Quinn didn't have time for any of it. He'd been going on little sleep since returning from Afghanistan seven days earlier, where he'd been training a local police force on behalf of the U.S. government. He was in his mid-thirties now, tall and lean, with a sharp-chiseled face, the high cheekbones from some Choctaw blood mixed in the ornery Scotch-Irish. Overseas, he'd let his hair grow out a bit, and now he sported a neat dark beard. He had on an old white tee and a pair of Levi's, as he watched the sun rise across his land, smoking a Liga Privada, with his cattle dog, Hondo, laying at his feet.<br><br> Jason rode up soon after, lashing his quarter horse to Quinn's truck's tailgate. "Hadn't you shaved yet?" Jason said.<br><br> "Barbershop's been closed since Mr. Jim died."<br><br> "Might oughtta keep it," Jason said. "Women sure do love outlaws."<br><br> "That what you were?" Quinn said. "Out in L.A.?"<br><br> Jason grinned. "If that's what they wanted," he said. "Then, sure. Beach bunnies could call me Jesse James. Come on and walk with me, I got something to talk about."<br><br> "We can talk right here on the porch."<br><br> "Be better if we get up, see some things, get the old imaginations working."<br><br> "Hell, Dad," Quinn said. "I know exactly what you're wanting to show me and the answer is no thank you. Can't you just let a man rest a bit? Sit back and fire up a stick with his dog he hasn't seen in a long while?"<br><br> "Plenty of time for Hondo," Jason said. "But opportunity? Opportunity doesn't come around that often. Can't you hear that sound?"<br><br> "That's just the cicadas," he said. "Screwing in the trees. They sure love all this heat."<br><br> Quinn stood up, stretched, and walked back into the old tin-roofed farmhouse that had stood on his family's land since 1895 and grabbed a pair of beaten cowboy boots. He slid them on, broken-in and comfortable, and returned, the screen door thwacking behind him. The house had a natural shotgun cooling effect between front door and back that helped as the summer wound down.<br><br> He reached for his cigar, burning on top of a coffee mug, and followed.<br><br> Jason was in his mid-sixties, wiry and fit, with a weathered face from years of drinking, fighting, and professionally racking up the odometer on his body. He kept a mustache and goatee, now snow-white like his longish hair. His T-shirt read stunts unlimited, an organization he'd helped found in the 1970s with a crazy man from Arkansas named Hal Needham. As Jason walked, Quinn noted the limp in his right leg was growing worse. The ball socket in his dad's hip and some of his femur had been telescoped when a landing platform busted on the set of The Fall Guy.<br><br> It was hard for Quinn to pass judgment on someone who punished his body. Quinn's ten years as a U.S. Army Ranger, most of it as a sergeant in some godforsaken country, had left him with a lot of mileage and scars. The years he'd spent as Tibbehah County sheriff had earned him a couple of gunshot wounds, which the people repaid by voting him out of office a year ago.<br><br> He followed his father through a ragged, twisting trail into some second-growth woods of pine, oak, and cedar, fringes of the land being eaten up by kudzu. It had rained the night before and the air smelled of damp earth and leaves, the canopy above him a bright green, lichen on the big trunks of oaks almost glowing. Water continued to drip on pine needles.<br><br> "I know you've just gotten home," Jason said, "but you need to think on the future. You need to think about what's going to be here after I'm gone and you're gone. Don't you want to leave something for Little Jason? Or if you and Anna Lee start having kids of your own?"<br><br> "Nothing's going to happen to this land," Quinn said. "And I don't think I'm having kids anytime soon."<br><br> "Y'all talking?"<br><br> Quinn didn't answer.<br><br> "I started late," Jason said. "Missed out on a lot of things."<br><br> "You missed out on a lot of things because you lived thousands of miles away."<br><br> "For a damn good reason."<br><br> Quinn just nodded, not sure if his dad had seen him or not, the older man intent on getting up the trail with that bad leg, cresting the hill over to the land that he wanted to discuss with Quinn. When the trail ended, so did the trees. And most living things. That rotten son of a bitch Johnny Stagg had strip-cleared one hundred acres of property that had once belonged to Quinn's uncle. When Uncle Hamp had fallen behind on some gambling debt, Stagg had swooped in, taken over the land, cut down every single tree, and bulldozed what was left. Johnny Stagg was like that. Conservation and the environment were four-letter words to his kind. And the reason every morning was a little brighter now with Stagg in federal prison.</p><h2>The House of the Scorpion</h2><p>Series: National Book Award Winner for Young People's Literature, Newbery Honor Book, Printz Honor Book<br><br>Matteo Alacr�n was not born; he was harvested.<br>His DNA came from El Patr�n, lord of a country called Opium--a strip of poppy fields lying between the United States and what was once called Mexico. Matt's first cell split and divided inside a petri dish. Then he was placed in the womb of a cow, where he continued the miraculous journey from embryo to fetus to baby. He is a boy now, but most consider him a monster--except for El Patr�n. El Patr�n loves Matt as he loves himself, because Matt is himself.<br><br>As Matt struggles to understand his existence, he is threatened by a sinister cast of characters, including El Patr�n's power-hungry family, and he is surrounded by a dangerous army of bodyguards. Escape is the only chance Matt has to survive. But escape from the Alacr�n Estate is no guarantee of freedom, because Matt is marked by his difference in ways he doesn't even suspect.</p><p>Fields of white opium poppies stretch away over the hills, and uniformed workers bend over the rows, harvesting the juice. This is the empire of Matteo Alacran, a feudal drug lord in the country of Opium, which lies between the United States and Aztlan, formerly Mexico. Field work, or any menial tasks, are done by "eejits," humans in whose brains computer chips have been installed to insure docility. Alacran, or El Patron, has lived 140 years with the help of transplants from a series of clones, a common practice among rich men in this world. The intelligence of clones is usually destroyed at birth, but Matt, the latest of Alacran's doubles, has been spared because he belongs to El Patron. He grows up in the family's mansion, alternately caged and despised as an animal and pampered and educated as El Patron's favorite. Gradually he realizes the fate that is in store for him, and with the help of Tam Lin, his bluff and kind Scottish bodyguard, he escapes to Aztlan. There he and other "lost children" are trapped in a more subtle kind of slavery before Matt can return to Opium to take his rightful place and transform his country.<p> Nancy Farmer, a two-time Newbery honoree, surpasses even her marvelous novel, <i>The Ear, The Eye and the Arm</i> in the breathless action and fascinating characters of <i>The House of the Scorpion</i>. Readers will be reminded of Orson Scott Card's Ender in Matt's persistence and courage in the face of a world that intends to use him for its own purposes, and of Louis Sachar's <i>Holes</i> in the camaraderie of imprisoned boys and the layers of meaning embedded in this irresistibly compelling story.

It&#39;s an expanded view of reality, a higher dimensional view brought to Earth by Tom Kenyon&#39;s amazing ability to contact and communicate with beings from other dimensions. Arcturians are brilliant, fearless and highly evolved. They have been, and will continue to be, our guardians and protectors. Includes a companion CD of the Nakura, an Arcturian sound meditation for exploring other dimensions of consciousness and the &#34;channeled&#34; sounds from an Arcturian Re-Genesis Chamber-all of them using Tom Kenyon&#39;s almost four-octave voice.</p><p></p><h2>On Mexican Time: A New Life in San Miguel</h2><p>An American writer and his wife find a new home&#x2014;and a new lease on life&#x2014;in the charming sixteenth-century hill town of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.<br><br>When Los Angeles novelist Tony Cohan and his artist wife, Masako, visited central Mexico one winter they fell under the spell of a place where the pace of life is leisurely, the cobblestone streets and sun-splashed plazas are enchanting, and the sights and sounds of daily fiestas fill the air. Awakened to needs they didn&#x2019;t know they had, they returned to California, sold their house and cast off for a new life in San Miguel de Allende. <b>On Mexican Time</b> is Cohan's evocatively written memoir of how he and his wife absorb the town's sensual ambiance, eventually find and refurbish a crumbling 250-year-old house, and become entwined in the endless drama of Mexican life. Brimming with mystery, joy, and hilarity, <b>On Mexican Time</b> is a stirring, seductive celebration of another way of life&#x2014;a tale of Americans who, finding a home in Mexico, find themselves anew.</p><p>In the mid-1980s, Tony Cohan and his artist wife, Masako, decided they had had enough of the hectic pace and inherent insecurities of life in Los Angeles and made tracks for the historic town of San Miguel de Allende in central Mexico. At first they rented rooms in a hotel. Then, when the hotel became less appealing, they graduated to renting an apartment. Almost inevitably, they eventually found themselves buying a 250-year-old hacienda on the verge of collapse, with wonderfully elegant Spanish colonial architecture and a garden brimming with papayas, avocados, and custard apples. <p> What followed was a love affair with a country and its people that has endured. <i>On Mexican Time</i> is a lyrical attempt to capture the Mexican magic that bewitched the two of them. Cohan introduces us to a quirky cast of Mexicans and expats, including murderers, idealists, philanderers, and writers. Spanning 15 years, the book conveys something of the curiously intangible passage of time, as we watch girls become mothers, marriages drift apart, and friends come and go. The text is rich with sensuous details, and Cohan is excellent at conveying the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes of a country that he clearly adores. </p><p> <i>On Mexican Time</i> is much less of a glib chronicle than other books of the "charming new life in paradise" genre. Although he is not averse to the odd moment of portentousness, Cohan makes a gentle and elegant guide through the experiences of expat life in San Miguel. <i>--Toby Green</i></p>?A seductive (but never sentimental) journey into a different way of life. Readers, pack your bags.?--Entertainment Weekly<br><br>?Cohan describes life in Mexico as ?intimate, voluptuous, sense-driven,? a phrase that also describes On Mexican Time.?--Boston Sunday Globe<br><br>?On Mexican Time is more than a travelogue, more than a vicarious journey for the reader.

Birds sang in the trees, bees buzzed in the blossom. The sky was hazy, though, and thunderheads on the horizon threatened rain later. But, for now, the air was hot and heavy. And, in the old cesspit behind the gardener's shed, a young man was treading water.<br><br>Well . . . treading, anyway.<br><br>Vimes stood back a little way and lit a cigar. It probably wouldn't be a good idea to employ a naked flame any nearer to the pit. The fall from the shed roof had broken the crust.<br><br>'Good morning!' he said cheerfully.<br><br>'Good morning, your grace,' said the industrious treadler.<br><br>The voice was higher pitched than Vimes expected and he realized that, most unusually, the young man in the pit was in fact a young woman. It wasn't <i>entirely</i> unexpected - the Assassins' Guild was aware that women were at least equal to their brothers when it came to inventive killing - but it nevertheless changed the situation somewhat.<br><br>'I don't believe we've met?' said Vimes. 'Although I see you know who I am. You are . . .?'<br><br>'Wiggs, sir,' said the swimmer. 'Jocasta Wiggs. Honoured to meet you, your grace.'<br><br>'Wiggs, eh?' said Vimes. 'Famous family in the Guild'<br><br>"Sir" will do, by the way. I think I once broke your father's leg?'<br><br>'Yes, sir. He asked to be remembered to you,' said Jocasta.<br><br>'You're a bit young to be sent on this contract, aren't you?' said Vimes.<br><br>'Not a contract, sir,' said Jocasta, still paddling.<br><br>'Come now, Miss Wiggs. The price on my head is at least-'<br><br>'The Guild council put it in abeyance, sir,' said the dogged swimmer. 'You're off the register. They're not accepting contracts on you at present.'<br><br>'Good grief, why not?'<br><br>'Couldn't say, sir,' said Miss Wiggs. Her patient struggles had brought her to the edge of the pit, and now she was finding that the brickwork was in very good repair, quite slippery and offered no handholds. Vimes knew this, because he'd spent several hours one afternoon carefully arranging that this should be so.<br><br>'So why were you sent, then?'<br><br>'Miss Band sent me as an exercise,' said Jocasta. 'I say, these bricks really are jolly tricky, aren't they?'<br><br>'Yes,' said Vimes, 'they are. Have you been <i>rude</i> to Miss Band lately? Upset her in any way?'<br><br>'Oh, no, your grace. But she did say I was getting over-confident, and would benefit from some advanced field work.'<br><br>'Ah. I see.' Vimes tried to recall Miss Alice Band, one of the Assassins' Guild's stricter teachers. She was, he'd heard, very hot on practical lessons.<br><br>'So . . . she sent you to kill me, then?' he said.<br><br>'No, sir! It's an exercise! I don't even have any crossbow bolts! I just had to find a spot where I could get you in my sights and then report back!'<br><br>'She'd believe you?'<br><br>'Of course, sir,' said Jocasta, looking rather hurt. 'Guild honour, sir.'<br><br>Vimes took a deep breath. 'You see, Miss Wiggs, quite a few of your chums have tried to kill me at home in recent years. As you might expect, I take a dim view of this.'<br><br>'Easy to see why, sir,' said Jocasta, in the voice of one who knows that their only hope of escaping from their present predicament is reliant on the goodwill of another person who has no pressing reason to have any.<br><br>'And so you'd be <i>amazed</i> at the booby traps there are around the place,' Vimes went on. 'Some of them are pretty cunning, even if I say it myself.'<br><br>'I certainly never expected the tiles on the shed to shift like that, sir.'<br><br>'They're on greased rails,' said Vimes.<br><br>'Well done, sir!'<br><br>'And quite a few of the traps drop you into something deadly,' said Vimes.<br><br>'Lucky for me that I fell into this one, eh, sir?'<br><br>'Oh, that one's deadly too,' said Vimes. '<i>Eventually</i> deadly.' He sighed. He really wanted to discourage this sort of thing but . . . they'd put him off the register? It wasn't that he'd <i>liked</i> being shot at by hooded figures in the temporary employ of his many and varied enemies, but he'd always looked at it as some kind of vote of confidence. It showed that he was annoying the rich and arrogant people who ought to be annoyed.<br><br>Besides, the Assassins' Guild was easy to outwit. They had strict rules, which they followed quite honourably, and this was fine by Vimes, who, in certain practical areas, had no rules whatsoever. <br>Off the register, eh? The only other person not on it any more, it was rumoured, was Lord Vetinari, the Patrician. The Assassins understood the political game in the city better than anyone, and if they took you off the register it was because they felt your departure would not only spoil the game but also smash the board . . .<br><br>'I'd be jolly grateful if you could pull me out, sir,' said Jocasta.<br><br>'What? Oh, yes. Sorry, got clean clothes on,' said Vimes. 'But when I get back to the house I'll tell the butler to come down here with a ladder. How about that?'<br><br>'Thank you very much, sir. Nice to have met you, sir.'<br><br>Vimes strolled back to the house. Off the register? Was he allowed to appeal? Perhaps they thought-<br><br>The scent rolled over him.<br><br>He looked up.<br><br>Overhead, a lilac tree was in bloom.<br><br>He stared.<br><br>Damn! Damn! <i>Damn!</i> Every year he <i>forgot</i>. Well, no. He never forgot. He just put the memories away, like old silverware that you didn't want to tarnish. And every year they came back, sharp and sparkling, and stabbed him in the heart. And today, of all days . . .<br><br>He reached up, and his hand trembled as he grasped a bloom and gently broke the stem. He sniffed at it. He stood for a moment, staring at nothing. And then he carried the sprig of lilac carefully back up to his dressing room.<br><br>Willikins had prepared the <i>official</i> uniform for today. Sam Vimes stared at it blankly, and then remembered. Watch Committee. Right. The battered old breastplate wouldn't do, would it . . . Not for His Grace the Duke of Ankh, Commander of the City Watch, Sir Samuel Vimes. Lord Vetinari had been very <i>definite</i> about that, blast it.<br><br>Blast it all the more because, unfortunately, Sam Vimes could see the point. He hated the official uniform, but he represented a bit more than just himself these days. Sam Vimes had been able to turn up for meetings with grubby armour, and even Sir Samuel Vimes could generally contrive to find a way to stay in street uniform at all times, but a Duke . . . well, a Duke needed a bit of polish. A Duke couldn't have the arse hanging out of his trousers when meeting foreign diplomats.<br><br>Actually, even plain old Sam Vimes never had the arse hanging out of his trousers, either, but no one would have actually started a war if he had.</p><h2>The Search for God and Guinness: A Biography of the Beer That Changed the World</h2><p><p><b>The history of Guinness, one of the world's most famous brands, reveals the noble heights and generosity of a great family and an innovative business.</b> </p><p>It began in Ireland in the late 1700s. The water in Ireland, indeed throughout Europe, was famously undrinkable, and the gin and whiskey that took its place was devastating civil society. It was a disease ridden, starvation plagued, alcoholic age, and Christians like Arthur Guinness-as well as monks and even evangelical churches-brewed beer that provided a healthier alternative to the poisonous waters and liquors of the times. This is where the Guinness tale began. Now, 246 years and 150 countries later, Guinness is a global brand, one of the most consumed beverages in the world. The tale that unfolds during those two and a half centuries has power to thrill audiences today: the generational drama, business adventure, industrial and social reforms, deep-felt faith, and the beer itself.</p><p>"Frothy, delicious, intoxicating and nutritious!No, I'm not talking about Guinness Stout-I'm talking about Stephen Mansfield's fabulous new book...The amazing and true story of how the Guinness family used its wealth and influence to touch millions is an absolute inspiration." - Eric Metaxas, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author</p><p>"It's a rare brew that takes faith, philanthropy and the frothy head of freshly-poured Guinness and combines them into such an inspiriting narrative. Cheers to brewmaster Stephen Mansfield! And cheers to you, the reader! You're in for a treat." - R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., Founder and editor-in-chief of <i>The American Spectator</i></p></p><p>Stephen Mansfield is a New York Times bestselling author and a popular speaker who is becoming one of the nation&#x2019;s most respected voices on religion in American culture. He is author of The Faith of George W. Bush, The Faith of the American Soldier, Then Darkness Fled: The Liberating Wisdom of Booker T. Washington, and Never Give In: The Extraordinary Character of Winston Churchill, among other works of history and biography. In 2008, Mansfield wrote The Faith of Barack Obama, intended as an objective look at Obama&#x2019;s religious life and the controversies that have surrounded it. The book reflects Mansfield&#x2019;s ability to compassionately describe theological and political views that are not necessarily his own, an ability he movingly demonstrated in his book on the life and views of Pope Benedict XVI. Founder of both The Mansfield Group, a research and communications firm, and Chartwell Literary Group, which creates and manages literary projects, Stephen is also in wide demand as a lecturer and inspirational speaker.</p><h2>Gratitude: Reflections on What We Owe to Our Country</h2><p>The conservative columnist renews his call for a year of voluntary national service for young people eighteen and over, in areas such as health, day care, and the environment, to strengthen their feeling and appreciation for their nation</p><p>5 1-hour cassettesThere is a growing debate in the United States as to whether the young should be encouraged or even compelled to give a year of "national service" to help the nation cope with its social problems, e.g., health care and illiteracy. While not advocating compulsory service, Buckley does argue that the young should be encouraged, through various rewards and sanctions, to give a year of service out of gratitude for civil liberties inherited and protected. While the idea seems to have merit on the surface, criticisms (cited by Buckley) that it smacks of totalitarianism, as well as the question of how this would be paid for on top of the national debt and the savings &amp; loan crisis make the idea less attractive.

Him. The Husband. Hero. Hunk.<br>The Boy Next Door. The Paramour. The Je t'adore.</i><br><br>Behind every famous man is a great woman&#x2014;and from the quick-tongued Mrs. Darwin to the lascivious Frau Freud, from the adoring Queen Kong to the long-suffering wife of the Devil himself, each one steps from her counterpart's shadow to tell her side of the story in this irresistible collection. Original, subversive, full of imagination and quicksilver wit, this is Carol Ann Duffy at her beguiling best.</p><p><b>Carol Ann Duffy </b>has been Britain's Poet Laureate since 2009. Her collections include<i> The World's Wife</i>, <i>Rapture</i>, and<i> The Bees</i>, which won the Costa Poetry Award. She has also received the Whitbread, Forward and T. S. Eliot Prizes, and the Lannan and E. M. Forster Prize in the U.S.The voices of Mrs. Tiresias, Mrs. Faust, Mrs. Quasimodo and other wives wittily recast myth and history from a woman's point of view in the pages of Manchester-based Duffy's fifth collection. Self-contained Penelope is not waiting for her Odysseus; frustrated Mrs. Sisyphus is married to a workaholic; Pygmalion's statue, tired of being pestered by her groping suitor, "changed tack/ grew warm, like candle wax/ kissed back"--and after sex gets dumped. But while Duffy's revisionist dramatic monologues are rife with clever twists, this material has been well mined by such poets as Alta, Margaret Atwood and Alicia Ostriker. Even references to Viagra, sheep-cloning and Monica Lewinsky seem an updating of Transformations (1971), Anne Sexton's deadpan fairy tales studded with cultural references, with the poems trapped in a similarly polarized conception of gender relations. Thus Thetis is brutalized in a new way each time she changes form--man is cross-bow to her albatross, charmer to her snake, fisherman to her mermaid--and to Queen Herod, the Christ child is simply a threat to her infant girl: he's "The Wolf. The Rip. The Rake. The Rat./The Heartbreaker. The Ladykiller. Mr. Right." The luckiest in love is Mrs. Beast, married to a devoted creature that's hung like a mule, and just as hardworking: "And if his snot and trotters fouled/ my damask sheets, why, then, he'd wash them. Twice." The flippant tone elicits chuckles, but one imagines these characters would've come a longer way by now, baby. (Apr.) FYI: Duffy's anthology Time's Tidings: Greeting the 21st Century includes 50 contemporary poets, each of whom is represented by a poem of his or her own on "time," and by a favorite poem on the same subject.

She tells her story in <i>Homesick, My Own Story</i>, a Newbery Honor Book. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ms Fritz is the author of forty-five books for children and young people. Many center on historical American figures, gaining her a reputation as the premier author of biographies for children and young people. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among the prestigious awards Ms. Fritz has garnered are: a medal from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a May Hill Arbuthnot Lecture, a Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, an American Book Award, a Christopher Award, a Boston Globe-Horn Book Non-Fiction Award, a<i> New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year, and many ALA Notable Books of the Year, <i>School Library Journal </i>Best Books of the Year, and ALA<i> Booklist</i> Editors&#x2019; Choice Awards.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Grade 4-7-A look at "the first great wave of European exploration" (1421-1522) through brief portraits of various participants. Fritz does many things well here. She writes with ease and humor, including details that add color and humanity to historical figures, and skillfully incorporates research into her narrative. She presents the heroic aspects of the voyages, as well as evidence of the arrogance, cruelty, and greed many of these men displayed. Despite all the good attributes, the book suffers because of the complexity of the subject matter. By including so many different individuals, the issue becomes complicated; after a while, the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese names start to run together. Some of the men's lifetimes and discoveries overlap, which makes it even more difficult to sort out who did what... and when. The illustrations are beautiful, entertaining, Renaissance-inspired pencil drawings. They include many amusing touches, such as the island of Porto Santo being overtaken by rabbits, but because they are in black and white and almost too finely drawn, they do not have a great deal of child appeal. A map at the beginning of each chapter shows the explorer's route. An outline of the continents appears on the end papers, but there aren't enough world maps throughout the book to enable readers to get a more complete picture of how the "discovered" countries fit into the world as a whole.

To be honest, I didn&#x2019;t like the whole thing. He wanted me to dress up in combat gear and read this corny-as-hell line while I saluted the viewer. It made me want to puke.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What was the line?&#x201d; Opie asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Christ, Ope,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;Why do you want to know all of this? I mean, right now? At this very moment? I find it highly inappropriate.&#x201d;</p><p>Wilcox looked at his watch. Nearly five minutes to the Wal-Mart delivery, the mission, and the action. He and Opie sat up front in the white Ford van, smoking Marlboro reds just like they had back in all those mud-slapped Zamindawar compounds. Cord was in back loading the AR-15s they&#x2019;d modified, duct-taping the magazines back-to-back for easy loading. The guns were untraceable. The van stolen. They&#x2019;d picked it off that morning at the Oak Court Mall in Memphis, switching the plates taken off a similar model.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You got me into this, least you can tell me how it all happened,&#x201d; Ope said. &#x201c;If you hadn&#x2019;t noticed, we&#x2019;re knee-deep in Shit City.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, what if I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You brought it up,&#x201d; Opie said. &#x201c;You said it was the reason you and Crissley got into it. Since she has no fucking clue what we&#x2019;re doing, she wanted you to go back and beg for your old job.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She was pissed,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;She thought she was going to get a cherry-red Mustang out of the deal.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the line?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Come on, buddy.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why the hell not?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;OK, OK,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;You really want to know? So, I&#x2019;m dressed in my battle fatigues and salute the camera and say, &#x2018;At Big T Southaven Ford, we never leave a customer behind.&#x2019; The fat-ass sales guys look to me and salute back. Then a flag unfurls out of my ass and the band strikes up, &#x2018;God Bless America.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; Opie said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. That fucking sucks. Humiliating. Are you even allowed to wear your uniform? I mean, isn&#x2019;t that against regulations?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t wear my dress blues,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;Just some utilities. And a helmet. They made me wear a fucking helmet. It was something from Word War II.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What about your medals?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They wanted me to wear them, but I told them hell no. I mean, I do have a speck of dignity somewhere I forgot. I&#x2019;d run out of money. It&#x2019;s not like winning a Silver Star led to some financial reward. I figured if anything, it might help jumpstart my country music career, but you know how that turned out.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I thought you sounded great,&#x201d; Opie said. &#x201c;Kind of like a more hard-edged Kenny Chesney.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That hurts, Ope,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;You know how much I hate that bald-ass pussy. If I hear that song &#x2018;Me and Tequila&#x2019; one more time, I&#x2019;m going to blow my fucking brains out.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opie, freckle faced and jug-eared, grinned. That was the one thing about Ope, he could drive you crazy with his diarrhea mouth, but damn if he wasn&#x2019;t game for walking into hell itself with a positive attitude. He was the kind of guy who&#x2019;d make jokes while you were tip-toeing though the poppy fields waiting for an IED to blow off your dick. &#x201c;I remember how you hated that song when you found me down in Florida.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Find you, hell,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;I fucking rescued you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Rescued me from pouring cocktails to women in bikinis,&#x201d; Opie said. &#x201c;Tough gig.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You were picking up trash on the beach and living with your grandpa,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;Those women all over you were cashing their Social Security checks.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jonas Cord moved up between the two front seats of the van and looked out the windshield. They&#x2019;d done a week of recon last month, hours of laying out the plan on maps, timing every mile and stashing the Kawasakis. The only thing they couldn&#x2019;t have predicted was the damn rain. Great falling sheets of it between where they&#x2019;d parked and the target. Jonas, hard, muscular, and absolutely humorless, leaned up between them and said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t see shit.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Life ain&#x2019;t all blueberries and paper airplanes,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;We say we&#x2019;re going to take the hill, we take the hill. I don&#x2019;t care if we&#x2019;re ass-deep in hailstones or a monsoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, we got a monsoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Spring showers,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;Bring spring pussy.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re late,&#x201d; Cord said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Two minutes,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;Get your panties out of a twist.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What if it&#x2019;s longer?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That we adapt,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;Adjust. Overcome. Clint Eastwood shit. Have you forgotten everything you&#x2019;ve learned, sergeant?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cord grinned and disappeared back into the back of the van. A minute later, a big gray armored truck rolled up in front of the Jericho First National bank and idled there with its headlights shining bright onto the entrance, red taillights glowing. When the guard stepped out into the rain and reached for the big sacks, Cord hit the timer on his watch.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you see his commercial?&#x201d; Opie said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, I saw it,&#x201d; Cord said. &#x201c;Also saw him open up for a Jimmy Buffett tribute band at the dog track in West Memphis. I&#x2019;d say I&#x2019;ve seen too much.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How was it?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He had one good song,&#x201d; Cord said. &#x201c;Real tearjerker about coming home from war and finding out momma didn&#x2019;t know his name.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That one was true.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opie and Cord didn&#x2019;t say anything, knowing they&#x2019;d gone one place that a Marine just couldn&#x2019;t tread. Talking about another Marine&#x2019;s momma. After all, there were tattoos for that and everything. As American as apple pie and a gallon of milk. Cord handed him and Opie a couple of masks to cover their faces, Donald J. Trump, and two AR-15s locked and jacked with a double-dick magazine. Cord would stay behind the wheel, he and Opie would run into the bank and make a large withdrawal.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This looks like a nice town,&#x201d; Opie said, sliding the Trump mask over his face and pulling the rifle&#x2019;s charging pin. &#x201c;White lights in those old trees on the Square. A big gazebo. Should we feel bad?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Wilcox said. &#x201c;Life isn&#x2019;t fair. Look at you guys and then look at me. It should be a crime that I got to be born so damn good-looking.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilcox checked his watch and put on his mask, remembering last time it had been Yoda and before that Santa Claus. He liked Trump better, it&#x2019;d scare the crap out of folks and would also make the news. Wilcox loved making the news. The Trump Bandits. He could see it now.</p><p>The guard appeared back outside the bank and crawled up front with the driver. Two minutes later, they were gone and the diversion well in motion. A little tight but manageable. A minute later, they heard the sirens. A cop car passed, and then two more headed toward Highway 45. It almost looked like a parade.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilcox and Opie got out of the van and walked together in the rain. Both carried their guns in big, oversized black canvas bags. The rubbery latex mask caught in a puckered gesture, yellow fake hair flapping in the wind.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside, Wilcox pulled out the weapon, shot at the ceiling, and shouted, &#x201c;Anyone moves and I&#x2019;ll grab &#x2018;em by the pussy.&#x201d;</p><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b>&#x2014;</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier that morning, Quinn Colson sat in a back booth of the Fillin&#x2019; Station diner finishing his third cup of coffee. He signaled the waitress, Miss Mary, for a refill right before Boom Kimbrough walked through the door and took off his jacket. He&#x2019;d known Boom for most of his life, the two growing up and hunting and fishing all over Tibbehah County. Boom still doing his fair share of hunting, coming in that morning dressed in an orange vest, even though he&#x2019;d had his right arm blown off six years ago while serving in the Guard in Iraq. He now wore a bright silver prosthetic device that Boom bragged was good for about any job except for wiping his ass.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary refilled the coffee and noticed Boom. She walked back toward the kitchen for his morning sausage biscuit and tall Mountain Dew without being asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I saw that big-ass Tom,&#x201d; Boom said. &#x201c;So close, hearing that gobble-gobble call. But man. He knew I was around. Got spooked and flew back into the woods.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You coming on or going off?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;On,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;Lillie&#x2019;s off today. Spending time with her kid.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She still pissed at you?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the one who wanted me to run. After a woman takes down a local hero, there&#x2019;s nowhere else for her to go but down.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This county wouldn&#x2019;t have elected a woman anyway,&#x201d; Boom said. &#x201c;Men don&#x2019;t have the nuts. A woman like Lillie Virgil scared the shit out of them. She talks straight and tells the truth.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Too qualified,&#x201d; Quinn said. The previous fall, the acting sheriff, Lillie Virgil, had charged the longtime football coach with molesting kids, and the whole town blamed her for the fallout. Instead of the coach. The locals didn&#x2019;t make a hell of a lot of sense. But Lillie told Quinn that if he didn&#x2019;t step up and take her place, everything they&#x2019;d worked for would turn to shit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And they settle for your broke-down ass.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quinn saluted him with the coffee mug and leaned back as Mary slid two sausage biscuits before Boom. The woman had been waiting tables at the Filling Station since Quinn was a kid, back when his Uncle Hamp had been sheriff and took visitors every morning at the same booth. More business getting done at the diner than at the office where Quinn had been sheriff for nearly five years, except for a year or so where he had been voted out of office. He was dressed in a stiff khaki uniform shirt, crisp Levi&#x2019;s, and polished cowboy boots. His Beretta 9mm rested on his belt and his uncle&#x2019;s old rancher coat hung by the front door.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; Boom said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to cause no trouble. But ever since the first of the year, old man Skinner been riding my ass. He wants me gone from the County Barn and he wants to put in his own people.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you hear that?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;From Skinner,&#x201d; Boom said. &#x201c;That motherfucker been shitting on everything since he took over the county supervisors. You know what he was like before he retired and said he was out of the life, letting Stagg run things. He&#x2019;s too old and too mean to do Jericho any good.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell him that,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;First of the year, Skinner announced to the supervisors and county employees that he intended to make Tibbehah a more godly place. Just like it&#x2019;d been when he was a boy. Leaving out the parts about the Klan, killings, and moonshine wars. But that&#x2019;s exactly the kind of horseshit people around here believe and trust.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And how&#x2019;d you get elected?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nobody else wanted the job,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;Including Lillie, if she was really honest about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How&#x2019;s your momma and them?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Daddy?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hadn&#x2019;t heard a word since he shagged ass.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ophelia?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quinn drank some coffee and watched Boom shove most of an entire biscuit in his mouth and chew.

The moment he stepped over the threshold, he noticed the smell of the house. It was . . . it was antiseptic, somehow. Not that young Peter, standing there so neatly attired in his blue shorts, white shirt, and yellow sweater vest, would have known the word "antiseptic." That was a big, important word. Most four-year-olds hadn't heard the word, couldn't use it in context, couldn't even come close to spelling it. In this regard, Peter Parker, who had celebrated his birthday the previous August at a big and splendid party where his parents had made a marvelous fuss over him, was no different. By age five, however, he would be able to correctly define and spell it . . . along with "microbiology," "cellular," and "mitosis." On the other hand, he would continue to stumble over "photosynthesis" and "paleontologist" until he reached the ripe old age of six.<br><br>Peter, however, wasn't looking that far ahead. Five and six were an eternity away. All that concerned Peter at that moment was the here and now. And what was here, and what wasn't.<br><br>He was here. These strange people whom he had supposedly met once, when he was a baby--but he sure couldn't remember--were here. That weird smell was here.<br><br>His parents were not.<br><br>The living room in which he was standing didn't seem even remotely inviting. The cushions of the couch were covered in plastic. He'd tried to sit on one and hadn't liked the way it had stuck to the underside of his legs. So he'd slid off it, but it had made this really weird squeaky "ripping" sound, and he hadn't liked that either.<br><br>The man and woman who were bringing the last of his things into the house, who were speaking in hushed whispers to the woman named Miss Hemmings--the "social worker," she'd been called--those people weren't paying any attention to him. That suited him fine. Perhaps he could simply reside there like a ghost, no one noticing him. When he was hungry, he could snitch food from the kitchen, presuming they had one, and otherwise be left alone.<br><br>He wanted that more than anything . . . particularly to be left alone by the man, who reminded him a little of his father. Except it wasn't him, and that made him feel all the more uneasy.<br><br>The door closed, shutting out the outside world. The smell of the plastic cushions threatened to suffocate him. He would have screamed if he could have worked up the energy to do so, but he felt wrung out, like a sponge.<br><br>The carpet was weird, too. It felt slightly moist under his feet, as if it had been just washed. Just to add to the assault, there was a lemony smell coming from all the wood furniture. He stared down at his reflection on the coffee table. There were flowers arranged neatly on a small lacy thing in the middle of it. He leaned forward to smell the flowers. The flowers, he realized belatedly, were fake. They were the only things in the whole living room that didn't smell.<br><br>"Well, Peter," said the man, coming into the room. He clapped his hands once and rubbed them briskly together. The magician at Peter's birthday party had done something similar, right before he'd produced coins from out of nowhere. He'd pretended he'd pulled them from thin air, but Peter had spotted the sleight-of-hand. In a loud voice he'd explained every single one of the magician's tricks, to the irritation of the conjurer and the endless amusement of his parents. His mother's laugh still rang in his ears. He hadn't yet been able to grasp the notion that he would never hear that laughter again.<br><br>"Well, Peter," the man said again, "would you like to sit down?"<br><br>"No, sir," Peter said politely, addressing the older man as "sir," just as his parents had always taught him.<br><br>"Land sakes, child," the woman said. "You can't just plan to stand there forever. Why won't you sit?"<br><br>He saw no reason to lie. "I don't like the plastic."<br><br>"The plastic protects the cushions," she said reasonably. "You understand that, don't you, Peter?"<br><br>"No, ma'am."<br><br>"Oh." She seemed vaguely disappointed. He felt as if he'd let her down in some way.<br><br>"Peter . . ." And the man got down on one knee. Closer up, the resemblance between this man and Peter's father was more striking. He had that same square jaw, that same laughter in his eyes. His hair was a different color, more red in it, and his eyebrows were bushier. Peter's nostrils flared. The man smelled funny, too.<br><br>"Why are you sniffing me, Peter? Are you part cocker spaniel?"<br><br>"You have a funny smell, sir."<br><br>"That would be my aftershave."<br><br>"It was his Christmas present," the woman said proudly. She sat down on the couch, her hands neatly folded in her lap. The couch made that same weird plastic-creaking sound when she sat on it. "Do you like it?"<br><br>"Smells like poop, ma'am," Peter said.<br><br>Her mouth immediately stretched to a thin line, while the man guffawed heartily. "He has his father's tact," the man said . . . and then immediately looked contrite. "I'm sorry, Peter. I spoke without thinking."<br><br>Peter's eyebrows knit. "You have to think to speak, don't you, sir?"<br><br>"Less often than you've been led to believe. And please, Peter, call me Uncle Ben. Have you ever heard of your Uncle Ben?" Encouraged by the boy's prompt nod, he said, "What have you heard?"<br><br>"That you make . . ." He frowned, trying to recall the word. ". . . perverted rice."<br><br>Now it was the woman's turn to laugh, as Uncle Ben's cheeks reddened slightly. "Different Uncle Ben, Peter. And I think you mean 'converted' rice."<br><br>"Oh." He was studying the woman now, comparing her automatically to the only woman who'd had a major place in his life. Her face was narrower, her eyes a bit more sunken. Her hair, which was brown with gray streaks, was tied back in a severe bun. She had a long neck and her hands tended to flutter toward it, as if she was trying to cool down waves of heat. "Okay," he added, to fill the silence.<br><br>"I'm your Aunt May," she told him. She said this with a great deal of gravity, as if she were revealing one of the great secrets of the universe.<br><br>"Okay," he said again.<br><br>The man clapped his hands together again. Peter waited for a dove to appear or a coin to drop out of the air. None was forthcoming. "Would you like to see your room, Peter?"<br><br>Finally something he understood. He nodded eagerly. "Do you wanna see where I drew some cowboys on the wall?" he asked.<br><br>Ben and May exchanged puzzled glances. "What do you mean, Peter?" Ben asked.<br><br>"Where I drew some cowboys. When I was little. Mommy yelled at me, and tried to wash them off, but you can still see them, 'cause I used markers."<br><br>"Ohhh," Ben said, and it sounded a little like a moan when he said it. "Peter, I mean your new room. Here."<br><br>"Can't I go back to my old room?"<br><br>"Peter, dear," said May, and she took his hand in hers. Her hand felt cold, but smooth, as if she'd put some sort of lotion on it. He noticed a few brown spots on the back of her hand and wondered what it would be like to connect them. "Your old room is back in Wisconsin. I thought the social worker explained it. . . . You'll be staying here, in New York. With us."<br><br>"Can't we stay at my house?"<br><br>"But Peter, this is where we live. And this is where you're going to live now," Ben told him, trying desperately to sound upbeat about it. "We'll make a good home here for you."<br><br>Obviously this Uncle Ben and Aunt May weren't getting it. "I have a home," Peter explained, politely but firmly.<br><br>"Peter . . ."<br><br>"You know what you need?" Aunt May suddenly said briskly. She didn't clap and rub her hands. Instead she patted them on her knees. "Some nice, freshly baked cookies. Why don't you go upstairs and get your things unpacked, and I'll whip up some cookies. Do you like chocolate chip?" When Peter nodded eagerly, she flicked a finger across the end of his nose in a playful manner. "I thought you might." She rose as she asked, "Is there anything else you'd like?"<br><br>"Yes, please."<br><br>"And what would that be?" She leaned over, hands resting on her knees. "What would you like?"<br><br>"My mommy and daddy."<br><br>She winced at that, and Ben, trying to sound kindly but firm, said, "Peter . . . you have to understand, you're going to live with us now."<br><br>"I don't want to," Peter told him firmly. He wasn't rude, wasn't whining or crying. He couldn't have been more polite if he'd been ordering a meal in a restaurant. "I want my mommy and daddy. Please," he put in almost as an afterthought.<br><br>"They're not here, Peter . . ." Ben began.<br><br>"Can I talk to them at least? Can you call them?"<br><br>"Peter," and Ben took him firmly by the shoulders. "Your parents . . . they're with God now."<br><br>"When are they coming back?"<br><br>Ben's lower lip was quivering. Peter had never seen a grown-up cry, and the feeling made his stomach queasy. He didn't think it was something that grown-ups did. Ben coughed loudly, took a deep breath, and said, "They're not coming back, Peter."<br><br>"I want to talk to them."<br><br>"You can't. They . . . they went away. . . ."<br><br>"I want to talk to them. Make them come back."<br><br>"Peter . . ."<br><br>"Make them come back!" And the sound and agony that ripped from Peter's throat terrified the child himself, because he couldn't believe that it was his own voice sounding like that. His eyes went wide, pupils tiny and swimming in a sea of white, and without another word he turned and bolted up the nearby steps.<br><br>Looking a lot older than he had a few minutes earlier, Ben turned to May and sighed dryly, "Well, that went well."<br><br>Peter sat on the floor in the middle of the room, his knees drawn up to just under his chin. He could have been a statue; he was that immobile. The room itself wasn't terrible, but it didn't feel especially warm. In Peter's room--his real room--all the furniture kind of looked like it went together. Here it seemed as if some random stuff had been stuck together in one place. At least none of it was covered in plastic.<br><br>Uncle Ben had brought up the last of his suitcases some time ago. Peter hadn't spoken to him. The truth was, he was embarrassed about his outburst and was quite certain that Uncle Ben was angry with him. So he had felt it wisest not to say anything and hope that, eventually, Uncle Ben would forget that he had shouted in such an inappropriate manner. That's what his mother would have said. "In-ap-pro-pri-ate, young man," with her finger waggling one quick downward stroke on every syllable.<br><br>Uncle Ben didn't try to strike up a conversation with him; he didn't seem to know what to say. For his part, Peter was busy focusing all his attention on the spider that was up in the corner of his room. It was quite big, hanging in the middle of an intricately designed web that stretched from the edge of the ceiling down to the upper portion of the wall. He had never seen anything so morbidly curious. On the one hand, it was incredibly ugly; on the other, it possessed such an elegant beauty that he couldn't look away. So Uncle Ben would come and go from the room, grunting slightly and wondering out loud why Peter was packing anvils in his suitcases--which puzzled Peter, who couldn't remember bringing any--while Peter sat there and watched the spider. The sun moved across the sky, the shadows lengthened, Uncle Ben stopped coming in and out, and Peter and the spider stared at each other until time ceased to have any meaning.<br><br>The smell of fresh-baked cookies wafted upstairs, seeping in through the doorway and wrapping the tempting fingers of their aroma around him. For a moment he was sorely tempted to abandon his vigil, which had boiled down to waiting for the spider to move. He resisted, however, although he did shift his posture so that he was sitting cross-legged.<br><br>Finally he heard footsteps again. He recognized them as belonging to Uncle Ben, but he didn't bother to turn around. Then he heard his uncle chuckling softly, and that distracted him. He swiveled his head and regarded his uncle, who was standing in the doorway, leaning against the frame, his arms folded. He was holding a small, wirebound book tucked under his right arm. "What's funny?" asked Peter.<br><br>"You just remind me so much of Ricky, that's all," said Uncle Ben. "Same serious face. I'll show you pictures of him at your age, if you want."<br><br>"Who's Ricky?"<br><br>"Ricky. Richard. Your dad."<br><br>Peter blinked in confusion. "How come you know my dad?"<br><br>Uncle Ben's jaw dropped. "How come I . . . ? Peter!" he said in astonishment. And then he sat down on the floor with Peter, just like his mom and dad used to. "Peter, your dad . . . he was my little brother! Didn't you understand that?"<br><br>Peter shook his head. "I thought you were my uncle."<br><br>"I am! An uncle or an aunt is what you call someone who is a brother or sister of a parent . . . in this case, your father."<br><br>Peter frowned, digesting that bit of information. "So . . . so Aunt May is my dad's sister?"<br><br>Ben made that odd sound that was a combination of laughter and a cough. "Peter, Aunt May is my wife!"<br><br>"You married your sister?" Peter was by now hopelessly confused.<br><br>"No, Peter." Rubbing the bridge of his nose between beefy fingers, Ben said, "We call her your aunt because she's married to me, which is the other way someone can be an aunt or uncle. By marriage. Understand?"<br><br>"I guess so," said Peter, who thought he did but wasn't 100 percent sure. Then he took a deep breath and let it out unsteadily. "My mom and dad aren't coming back, are they?"<br><br>"No, Peter," Ben told him, as gently as he could. "They were killed in an airplane crash. It was an accident."<br><br>"No," Peter said flatly. "It wasn't."<br><br>"It wasn't?" said Ben curiously.<br><br>Peter shoved his hand into one of the bags and extracted a stack of comic books. "They were secret heroes. Like . . . spies. And they were helping their country, and a bad guy, like the Red Skull, killed them." He held up an old issue of a comic, spine-rolled and tattered.</p><h2>American Farmstead Cheese: The Complete Guide To Making and Selling Artisan Cheeses</h2><p><p>This comprehensive guide to farmstead cheese explains the diversity of cheeses in terms of historical animal husbandry, pastures, climate, preservation, and transport-all of which still contribute to the uniqueness of farm cheeses today.<br> Discover the composition of milk (and its seasonal variations), starter cultures, and the chemistry of cheese.

Therefore, artisan cheesemakers adhere to the traditional methods of their craft to bring forth the nuances in flavor that are generated through the intimate connection with the seasons and the environment. The finest cheese may vary, but it should vary within a certain standard if it is to be commercially marketable. Some artisan cheesemakers benefit from following traditions that produce these results, but most of us are relatively new at the game. For the less experienced cheesemakers, then, traditional methods should be supported by scientific principles to the extent necessary to make consistently high-quality cheese. It is important to note that many of the traditional artisan cheesemakers have strong support from the scientific community in their distinctive agricultural regions. The melding of craft and science is used to strengthen the activity on which their livelihood is based.<br> <br> A cheese such as Cheddar, which was once exclusively made by artisan cheesemakers in Great Britain, has largely turned into the product of an industrial process, though the craft of making Cheddar is still alive. Wheels of Cheddar sealed in cloth bandages, which represent the fruit of an artisan cheesemaker's labor, are still being made. In reading about the history of cheesemaking, we learns that 150 years ago the farm-made Cheddars were more variable in quality because cheesemakers differed in attitude and aptitude--that is, some were better at their craft than others. This could be attributed to many factors, most notably attention to cleanliness during milking and cheesemaking; construction of dairies, creameries, and cheese stores; and systems of cheesemaking. In the case of Cheddar, quality was improved by using methods based on scientific principles--such as the cheddaring process, hygiene, and temperature control during making and aging--that were developed by Joseph Harding in England from the 1850s onward.<br> <br> Joseph Harding dedicated many years to improving the standard of quality for British cheese. He used scientific principles to develop methods for making cheese that did away with some of the guesswork and exorcised the mysticism of certain traditional methods that produced haphazard results. In this way he was able to demonstrate that some "traditional" practices led to poor quality and also showed how to make significant and consistent improvements by following new practices based on an understanding of dairy science. At first cheesemakers were skeptical of his methods, but the string of blue ribbons collected by his family for their Cheddar cheeses proved him the wiser, and several of his daughters went on to consult and work for other cheese businesses in Great Britain and the United States (Cheke, 1959).<br> <br> This is the appropriate way for artisan cheesemakers to use science. It is now common practice to integrate scientific principles with traditional cheesemaking practices to better understand how cheese of the highest quality standard is made. This, in turn, enables dairying regions to maintain and develop viable economic enterprises that are centered on artisanal cheesemaking. The key is to produce cheese with a high level of quality, on which a reputation can be built, thereby ensuring marketability over the long term. As a cheesemaker myself--I make 20,000 pounds/9,000 kg of cheese a year for sale throughout New England--I need an approach that will reduce variability and build a reputation for quality. Therefore, I rely on science to enhance the art of cheesemaking. I use standardized rennet and pure starter cultures made in laboratories, and I test acidity regularly during the cheesemaking process. The rest of what I do is based on my knowledge of the craft, which has been built up over only 20 years.</p></p><h2>Crystal Muse: Everyday Rituals to Tune In to the Real You</h2><p>Crystal Muse explores how you can transform life&#x2019;s challenges into opportunities for growth by being equipped with the right crystals and mindset.

So wherever the probes said life might exist, wherever stars looked friendly to living creatures, humans ventured with some caution, and unfolded their mechanical ears and listened into the dark&#x2014;as <i>Phoenix</i> listened intently during her hundred hours traverse of realspace.<br> &nbsp;<br> She heard nothing at any range&#x2014;which pleased her captains and the staff aboard. <i>Phoenix</i> wanted to find no prior claims to what she wanted, which was a bridge to a new, resources-rich territory, most particularly and immediately a G5 star designated T-230 in the Defense codebooks, 89020 on the charts, and mission objective, in the plans <i>Phoenix</i> carried in her data banks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reach the star, unlimber the heavy equipment ... create a station that would welcome traders and expand human presence into a new and profitable area of space.<br> &nbsp;<br> So <i>Phoenix</i> carried the bootstrap components for that construction, the algaes and the cultures for a station&#x2019;s life-sustaining tanks, the plans and the circuit maps, the diagrams and the processes and the programs, the data and the detail; she carried as well the miner-pilots and the mechanics and the builders and processors and the technical staff that would be, for their principal reward, earliest shareholders in the first-built trading station to develop down this chain of stars&#x2014;Earth&#x2019;s latest and most confident colonial commitment, with all the expertise of past successes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Optics told Mother Earth where the rich stars were. Robots probed the way without any risk of human life...probed and returned with their navigational data and their first-hand observations: T-230 was a system so rich <i>Phoenix</i> ran mass-loaded to the limit, streaking along at a rate a ship dared carry when she expected no other traffic, and when she had no doubt of refuel capabilities at her destination. She shoved the gas and dust around her into a brief, bright disturbance, while her crew ran its hundred-hour routine of maintenance, recalibrations, and navigational checks. The captains shared coffee on the last watch before re-entry, took the general reports, and approved the schedule the way the navigator, McDonough, keyed it.<br> &nbsp;<br> But what the pilot received of that discussion was a blinking green dot on the edge of his display and a vague sense that things were proceeding comfortably on schedule, aboard a ship in good order. Taylor was On, which meant Taylor had input coming at him at rates it took a computer interface to sort, and, insulated from the tendencies of an unassisted human mind to process laterally and distract itself from the rush of data, Taylor had his ears devoted to computer signals and his eyes and his perceptions chemically adjusted to the computer-filtered velocity of the ship&#x2019;s passage.<br> &nbsp;<br> The green dot had to be there before he hyped out. The dot had showed up, and what other human beings did about it was not in any sense Taylor&#x2019;s business or realization. When that exit point came at him, and time folded up in his face, he reached confidently ahead and through space, toward T-230.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was a master pilot. The drugs in his blood made him highly specific in his concentration, and highly abstract in his understandings of the data that flashed in front of his eyes and screamed into his ears. He would have targeted <i>Phoenix</i> into the heart of hell if those had been the coordinates the computer handed him. But it was to T-230 he was looking.<br> &nbsp;<br> For that reason, he was the only one aboard aware when the ship kept going, and time stayed folded.<br> &nbsp;<br> And stayed.<br> &nbsp;<br> His heart began to pound in realtime, his eyes were fixed on screens flashing red, lines, and then dots, as those lines became hypothetical, and last of all a black screen, where POINT ERROR glowed in red letters like the irretrievable judgment of God.<br> &nbsp;<br> Heartbeat kept accelerating. He reached for the ABORT and felt the cap under his fingers. He had no vision now. It was all POINT ERROR. He scarcely felt the latch: and time was still folding as he uncapped the ABORT, for a reason he no longer remembered. Unlike the computer, he had no object but that single, difficult necessity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Program termination.<br> &nbsp;<br> Blank screen.<br> &nbsp;<br> POINT ERROR.<br> &nbsp;<br> God had no more data.<br> &nbsp;<br> II<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> The ship dropped and the alarm sounded: This is not a drill. Computer failure. This is not a drill....<br> &nbsp;<br> McDonough&#x2019;s heart was thumping and the sweat was running from exertion as he pressed the button to query Taylor. Every screen was blank.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is not a drill....<br> &nbsp;<br> The hard-wired Abort was in action. <i>Phoenix</i> was saving herself. She blew off <i>v</i> with no consideration of fragile human bodies inside her.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Phoenix</i> then attempted to re-boot her computers from inflowing information. She queried her captain, her navigator, and her pilot and co-pilot, with painful shocks to the Q-patch. Two more such jolts, before McDonough found data taking shape on his screens at the navigation station.<br> &nbsp;<br> Video displayed the star.<br> &nbsp;<br> No, two stars, one glaring blue-white, one faint red. McDonough sat frozen at his post, seeing in <i>Phoenix</i>&#x2019; future-line a coasting drift to white, nuclear hell.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d; someone asked. &#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a question the navigator took for accusation. McDonough felt it like a blow to his already abused gut, and looked toward the pilot for an answer. But Taylor was just staring at his screens, doing nothing, not moving.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Inoki,&#x201d; McDonough said. But the co-pilot was slumped unconscious or worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get Greene up here. Greene and Goldberg, to the bridge.&#x201d; That was LaFarge on the staff channel, senior captain, hard-nosed and uncompromising, calling up the two backup pilots.<br> &nbsp;<br> McDonough felt the shakes set in, wondered if LaFarge was going to call up all the backups, and oh, one part of him wanted that, wanted to go to his bunk and lie there inert and not have to deal with reality, but he had to learn what that binary star was and where they were and what mistake he might conceivably have committed to put them here. The nutrients the med-plug was shooting into him were making him sick. The sight in front of him was insane. Optics couldn&#x2019;t be wrong. The robots couldn&#x2019;t be wrong. Their instruments couldn&#x2019;t be wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; Karly McEwan was sitting beside him, as stunned as he was&#x2014;his own immediate number two: she was shaken, but she was punching buttons, trying, clamp-jawed as she was, to get sense out of chaos. &#x201c;Sir? Go to default? Sir?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Default for now,&#x201d; he muttered, or some higher brain function did, while his conscious intelligence was operating on some lower floor. The &#x2018;for now&#x2019; that had bubbled up as a caution hit his faltering intelligence like a pronouncement of doom, because he didn&#x2019;t see any quick way to get a baseline for this system. &#x201c;Spectrum analysis, station two and three. Chart comparison, station four. Station five, rerun the initiation and target coordinates.&#x201d; The forebrain was still giving orders. The rest was functioning like Taylor, which was not at all. &#x201c;We need a medic up here. Is Kiyoshi on the bridge? Taylor and Inoki are in trouble.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are we stable?&#x201d; Kiyoshi Tanaka&#x2019;s voice, asking if it was safe to unbelt and go after the pilots, but every question seemed to echo with double meanings, every question trailed off into unknowns and unknowables. &#x201c;Stable as we can be,&#x201d; LaFarge said, and meanwhile the spectral analysis program was turning up a flood of data and running comparisons on every star system on file, a steady crawl of non-matches on McDonough&#x2019;s number one screen, while the bottom of it reported NOT A MATCH, 3298 ITEMS EXAMINED.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting questions from channel B,&#x201d; came from Communications. &#x201c;Specials are requesting to leave quarters. Requesting screen output.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Taylor&#x2019;s routine. Taylor had always given the passengers a view, leaving Earth system, entering the mass points, and leaving them....<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; LaFarge said harshly. &#x201c;No image.&#x201d; A blind man could see it was trouble. &#x201c;Say it&#x2019;s a medical on the bridge. Say we&#x2019;re busy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tanaka had reached Taylor and Inoki, and was injecting something into Taylor, McDonough was aware of that. The passengers were feeling the variance in routine, and the NOT A MATCH hadn&#x2019;t changed.<br> &nbsp;<br> SEARCH FURTHER?<br> &nbsp;<br> The computer had run out of local stars.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Karly, you prioritized search from default one?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;From default,&#x201d; Navigation Two answered. The search for matching stars had started with Sol and the near neighborhood. &#x201c;Our vector, plus and minus ten lights.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The sick feeling in McDonough&#x2019;s gut increased.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing made sense. The backup pilots showed up, asking distracting questions nobody could answer, the same questions every navigator was asking the instruments and the records. The captain told the medic to get Taylor and Inoki off the bridge&#x2014;the captain swore when he said it, and McDonough distractedly started running checks of his own while Tanaka got the two pilots on their feet&#x2014;Taylor could walk, but Taylor looked blind to what was going on. Inoki was moving, but just scarcely: one of the com techs had to haul him up and carry him, once Tanaka unbuckled him and unplugged the tube from his implant. Neither of them looked at Greene or Goldberg as they passed. Taylor&#x2019;s eyes were set on infinity. Inoki&#x2019;s were shut.<br> &nbsp;<br> SEARCH FURTHER? the computer asked, having searched all the stars within thirty lights of Earth.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We stand at 5% on fuel,&#x201d; the captain reported calmly&#x2014;a potential death sentence. &#x201c;Any com pickup at all?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At this star? McDonough asked himself, and: &#x201c;Dead silent,&#x201d; Communications said. &#x201c;The star&#x2019;s noisy enough to mask God-knows-what.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go long range, back up our vector. Assume we overshot the star.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Aye, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A moment later, hydraulics whined up on the hull. The big dish was unpacking and unfolding, preparing to listen. <i>V</i> was down to a crawl safe for its deployment&#x2014;safe, if it was Earth&#x2019;s own Sun, but it wasn&#x2019;t. There was no data on this system. They were gathering it, drinking it in every sensor, but nothing gave them even minimal certainty there wasn&#x2019;t a rock in their path. Nobody had ever come in at a close binary, or a mass as large. God only knew what had happened to the field.<br> &nbsp;<br> McDonough&#x2019;s hands were shaking as he punched up the scope of both search sequences, approaching a hundred lights distant in all directions, search negative, past their objective. They still didn&#x2019;t know where they were, but with 5% fuel in reserve, they weren&#x2019;t leaving soon, either. They had the miner-craft: thank God they had the miner-craft and the station components. They might gather system ice and refuel...<br> &nbsp;<br> Except that was a radiation hell out there, except the solar wind that blue-white sun threw out was a killing wind. This was not a star where flesh and blood could live, and if the miners did go out to work in that, they had to limit their time outside.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or if the ship was, as it might well be, infalling, on a massive star&#x2019;s gravity slope ... they&#x2019;d meet that radiation close-up before they went down.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve rerun the initiation sequence,&#x201d; Greene said, from Taylor&#x2019;s seat. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t find any flaw in the commands.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Meaning Taylor had keyed in on what navigation had given him. A cold apprehension gnawed at McDonough&#x2019;s stomach.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Any answer, Mr. McDonough?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not yet, sir.&#x201d; He kept his voice calm. He didn&#x2019;t feel that way. He hadn&#x2019;t made a mistake. But he couldn&#x2019;t prove it by anything they had from the instruments.<br> &nbsp;<br> A ship couldn&#x2019;t come out of hyperspace aimed differently than it had on entry. It didn&#x2019;t. It couldn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> But if some hyperspace particle had screwed the redundant storage, if the computer had lost its destination point and POINT ERROR was the answer, they couldn&#x2019;t run far enough on their fuel mass to be out of sight of stars they knew.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two stars, in any degree near each other, both with spectra matching the charts, were all they needed. Any two-star match against their charts could start to locate them, and they couldn&#x2019;t be more than five lights off their second mass point, if they&#x2019;d run out all the fuel they were carrying&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t be. Not farther than twenty lights from Earth total at most.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there wasn&#x2019;t a massive blue-white within twenty lights of the Sun, except Sirius, and this wasn&#x2019;t Sirius. Spectra of those paired suns were a no-match. It wasn&#x2019;t making sense. Nothing was.<br> &nbsp;<br> He started looking for pulsars. When you were out of short yardsticks you looked for the long ones, the ones that wouldn&#x2019;t lie, and you started thinking about half-baked theories, like cosmic macrostructures, folded interfaces, or any straw of reason that might give a mind something to work on or suggest a direction they&#x2019;d gone or offer a hint which of a hundred improbables was the truth.</p><h2>Carl&#39;s Sleepy Afternoon</h2><p><p><b>A new book to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i></b><br><b><i></i></b>Carl is finally back! Once again, Alexandra Day has concocted a very busy day for the amazing and all-around resourceful Rottweiler Carl. His owner believes Carl is at home taking a nap, when really he's making tracks all over town. He visits a bakery, makes a delivery for the pharmacist, helps out a veterinarian, and joins in a magician's act in the park. But in the most important event of the day, Carl becomes a real hero when he rescues a litter of puppies from a fire.</p><p>With eight more pages of fun than in the previous Carl books, this captivating adventure, related mostly through pictures, will delight fans old and new.</p></p><p><b>Alexandra Day</b> is the author and illustrator of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> and the rest of the beloved Carl books, including <i>Carl Goes Shopping</i>, <i>Carl's Christmas</i>, <i>Carl's Birthday</i> and <i>Carl's Snowy Afternoon</i>. The Darlings' own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the original model for the main character of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>. Since then, two other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the sequels: the late Arambarri, who was named for one of the Darlings' favorite jai alai players; and Zabala, who currently moonlights as an Our Best Friend therapy dog, visiting hospitals to cheer patients.Twenty years after making his debut in <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>, the Rottweiler who has charmed a generation of readers has lost none of his appeal&#x2014;or his spunk. Here Madeleine's mother tells Carl that she and her daughter are going shopping so he "can have a nice nap." Not likely. When the driver of a thrift-shop van arrives to pick up donated items, Carl helps him load the goods and then jumps into the back of the vehicle, scooting out at a bakery where Madeleine and her mother have stopped. The cherubic tot gleefully spots Carl through the window and surreptitiously feeds him a cookie after he slips inside. The canine hero helps a pharmacist by delivering medicine to a vet, again meets up with Madeleine at a flower stand (where he purloins a bloom and places it in a woman's shopping bag) and rescues puppies from a burning garage. The dog arrives at home, just ahead of his owners. As in past Carl tales, Day injects wry, child-pleasing flourishes: for instance, Carl's appearances go undetected by Madeleine's mother. Playing the key role in relaying the action, Day's stunningly realistic, brightly hued illustrations are as timeless and endearing as the plot. Carl fans young and old will cheer his return as they discover that this anything-but-sleepy canine is aging very well indeed.

Shiatsu is one of the oriental medical disciplines that have made great progress in such therapy. <br> The common conception that shiatsu is no more than the application of strong digital pressure on single points on the body misrepresents the truth. Shiatsu is based on a full oriental medical system, which explains the human body in terms of a network of meridians through which flows an energy called Ki in Japanese. If the flow of Ki through the meridians is smooth, the person is healthy. If the flow becomes sluggish, the person falls ill. The nature of the flow is analyzed on the basis of the Chinese conception of the duality Yin and Yang into two states called Kyo and Jitsu. In the Kyo state, the flow of Ki is sluggish, and the body functions are dulled. In the Jitsu state, the flow is too rapid, and the body functions are overactive. A therapy that fails to take these states into consideration can only further retard the activity of sluggish functions and further stimulate hyperactive ones. In short, such therapy can produce no beneficial effect at all. <br> The way to restore the proper balance to the system of Ki energy is the subject of <em>Zen Shiatsu</em>, the first book on the topic ever published in the English language. In this richly illustrated work, the author thoroughly covers to-nification-sedation, meridian shiatsu (Zen shiatsu). In addition to the services he performs as a therapist, he has devoted many years of study and much effort to developing new shiatsu ideas. <em>Zen Shiatsu</em> is the result of all these efforts. The inclusion of a chapter on self-shiatsu makes this an unusual and valuable book from the standpoint of people interested in home remedies. <br></p><p><br>SHIZUTO MASUNAGA was born in 1925. After graduating from the Psychology Department of the University of Kyoto, he began working in the field of shiatsu. For ten years, he was an instructor at the Japan Shiatsu Institute. At present he is a member of the Japan Psychology Association and the Japan Oriental Medicine Association and the chairman of the Iokai Association for Shiatsu Therapy. <br> <br> The first person to establish a theoretical basis for shiatsu therapy, Masunaga has evolved his own practical method of shiatsu treatment based on his many years of clinical experience and, through his important and widely recognized contributions, has established himself firmly as the leading authority in the field. <br> <br> Some of his numerous written works are WATARU OHASHI grew up in war-torn Hiroshima Prefecture and was saved from near death at the age of two through moxibustion treatment. His familys accounts of this experience created an early interest in oriental healing, and he sought shiatsu instruction after graduating from Chuo University. He began teaching early in his career, and in 1974 he founded the Shiatsu Education Center of America in New York City, where he and his associates conduct classes. <br></p><h2>Great Stories Remembered II</h2><p>A sterling collection of almost &#x201c;forgotten&#x201d; literary gems destined to become instant favorites.</p><p>Joe Wheeler, Ph.D., is professor emeritus of English at Washington Adventist University and cofounder and executive director of the International Zane Grey&#x2019;s West Society.

The few, the proud. From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli. Once a Marine, always a Marine. The United States Marine Corps, with its fiercely proud tradition of excellence in combat, its hallowed rituals, and its unbending code of honor, is part of the fabric of American myth. No other group in America leaves so deep and permanent a mark on its members. Today, though, the Marine Corps feels increasingly besieged, at war with a new kind of enemy the vast social and political forces that it feels threaten to destroy its values. <i>Making the Corps</i> visits the front lines of that war: boot camp, Parris Island, South Carolina, "where the difference begins." Here, old values are stripped away and new, Marine Corps values, forged. Acclaimed military journalist Thomas E. Ricks follows sixty-three raw recruits, the men of recruit platoon 3086, from their hometowns to Parris Island, through boot camp, and into their first year as Marines. As three fierce drill instructors fight a battle for the hearts and minds of this unforgettable group of young men, a larger picture emerges, brilliantly painted, of the growing gulf that divides the military from the rest of America.</p></p><p>Marines are different: distinct not only from ordinary U.S. citizens but from the ranks of the army, navy, and air force as well. The difference begins with boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina, where the history and future of the United States Marine Corps intersect in the training of every new recruit. In <i>Making the Corps</i>, Ricks follows a platoon of young men through 11 grueling weeks of boot camp as their drill instructors indoctrinate them into the culture of the Few and the Proud. Many arrive at Parris Island undisciplined and apathetic; they leave as marines.<p> With the end of the cold war, the role of the American military has shifted in emphasis from making war to keeping peace. "The best way to see where the U.S. military is going is to look at the marines today," says Ricks, as the other armed forces have begun to emulate the marine model. To understand Parris Island--a central experience in the life of every marine--is to understand the ethos of the Marine Corps. Ricks examines the recent changes in the <i>Standard Operating Procedures for Recruit Training</i> (the bible of Parris Island), which indicate how the corps is dealing with critical social and political issues like race relations, gender equality, and sexual orientation. <i>Making the Corps</i> pierces the USMC's "sis-boom-bah" mythology to help outsiders understand this most esoteric and eccentric of U.S. armed forces. <i>--Tim Hogan</i></p>Thomas Ricks is one of America's most esteemed military journalists.

Dominika eased back behind a street pole: it was unlikely that the rabbit was using the snack stop as a way to check his six&#x2014;for the last three days he had shown himself to be oblivious on the street&#x2014;but she wanted to avoid his noticing her too soon. Plenty of other street creatures already had watched her passing through the crowd&#x2014;dancer&#x2019;s legs, regal bust, arc-light-blue eyes&#x2014;cutting her scent, sniffing for strength or frailty.<br> <br>In two practiced glances, Dominika checked the zoo of faces but did not get that tingle on the back of her neck that meant the start of trouble. The rabbit, a Persian, finished tearing the strips of meat with his teeth and tossed the short skewer into the gutter. Apparently this Shia Muslim had no compunctions about eating pork&#x2014;or slathering his face between the legs of hookers, for that matter. He started moving again, Dominika keeping pace.<br> <br>An unshaven and swarthy young man left his friends leaning against the steam-weeping window of a noodle shop, slid in beside Dominika, and put an arm around her shoulder. &#x201c;Je bande pour toi,&#x201d; he said in the crooked French of the Maghreb&#x2014;he had a hard-on for her. Jesus. She had no time for this, and felt the smoldering surge in her stomach running into her arms. No. Become ice. She shook his arm off, pushed his face away, and kept walking. &#x201c;Va voir ailleurs si j&#x2019;y suis&#x201d;&#x2014;go somewhere else, see if I&#x2019;m there&#x2014;she said over her shoulder. The young man stopped short, made an obscene gesture, and spat on the sidewalk.<br> <br>Dominika reacquired the Persian&#x2019;s gray head just as the man entered La Diva, passing through the scrolling lights framing the dance hall&#x2019;s entrance. She drifted toward the door, noted the heavy velvet curtain, and gave him a beat to get inside, this diminutive man who held the nuclear secrets of the Islamic Republic of Iran in his head. He was her prey, a human intelligence target. Dominika ran the edge of her will rasping across the whetstone of her mind. It was to be a hostile recruitment attempt, an ambush, coercive, a cold pitch, and she thought she had an even chance to flip him in the next half hour.<br> <br>Tonight Dominika wore her brown hair down around her shoulders, bangs covering one eye, like an Apache dancer from the 1920s. She wore square-framed tortoiseshell eyeglasses with clear lenses, a Parisian Lois Lane out for the night. But the typing-pool effect was spoiled by the low-cut black sheath dress and Louboutin pumps. She was a former ballerina, her legs shapely and knotted in the calves, though she walked with a nearly imperceptible limp from a right foot shattered by a ballet-academy rival when Dominika was twenty years old.<br> <br><br> <br>Paris. She hadn&#x2019;t breathed the air of the West since she returned to Moscow after being exchanged in a spy swap on a bridge in Estonia months ago. The images of the exchange were fading, the sound of her long-ago steps on the silver-wet bridge increasingly muffled, draped in the fog of that night. Returned home, she had inhaled the Russian air deeply; it was her country, Rodina, the Motherland, but the clean bite of pine forest and loamy black earth was tainted by a hint of liquid corruption, like a dead animal beneath the floorboards. Of course, she had been greeted back home enthusiastically, with florid kudos and good wishes from lumpy officials. She had reported for work at SVR Headquarters&#x2014;referred to as the Center&#x2014;immediately, but seeing her colleagues in the Service once again, the milling herd of the siloviki, the anointed inner circle, had collapsed her spirit. What did you expect? she thought.<br> <br>Things were different with her now. Exquisitely, massively, dangerously different. She had been recruited by a CIA case officer&#x2014;with whom she had fallen in love&#x2014;then vetted, trained, and directed to return to Moscow as a penetration of the Center. She was learning to wait, to listen, to appear to be a wholly quiescent creature of the mephitic atmosphere of her Service. To that end, she had demurred when several idiotic headquarters positions were offered to her&#x2014;she would wait for a job with the kind of access CIA really wanted. She feigned interest in the process and otherwise took the time to attend a short course in operational psychology, and another in counterintelligence: It might be useful in the future to know how mole hunters in her Service would be hunting, how the footsteps in the stairwell would sound when they came for her.<br> <br>She bided her time by looking into their souls, for Dominika was born a synesthete, with a brain wired to see colored auras around people and thereby read passion, treachery, fear, or deception. When she was five years old, Dominika&#x2019;s synesthesia shocked and worried her professor father and musician mother. They made their little girl promise never to reveal this soaring precocity to anyone, even as she grew accustomed to it. At twenty, Dominika was lifted on maroon waves of music at the ballet academy. At twenty-five, she calibrated a man&#x2019;s lust by his scarlet halo. Now just past thirty, being able to divine men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s spirits just possibly would save her life.<br> <br>There was something else. Since her recruitment, Dominika had been visited by images of her late mother, a benign chimera that would appear by her side to offer encouragement and support. Russians are spiritual and emotional, so fondly remembering ancestors was not at all creepy or demented. At least Dominika didn&#x2019;t worry about it, and besides, her mother&#x2019;s spirit fortified her as she resumed her double life, a shimmering hand on her shoulder as she stood at the mouth of the dark cave, smelling the beast inside, willing herself to get on with it.<br> <br>On her return to the Center from the West, there had been two clearance sessions with an oily little man from counterespionage and a saturnine female stenographer. He asked about the ubiytsa, the Spetsnaz assassin who had almost killed her in Athens, and then about being in CIA custody: what the CIA men had been like, what the Americans asked her, what she told them; Dominika had stared down the stenographer, who was swaddled in a yellow haze&#x2014;deceit and avarice&#x2014;and replied that she told them nothing. The bear sniffed at her shoes and nodded, apparently satisfied. But the bear was never satisfied, she thought. It never was.<br> <br>Her exploits, and near escapes, and contact with the Americans cast suspicion on her&#x2014;as it was with anyone returning from active service in the West&#x2014;and she knew the liver-eyed lizards of the FSB, the Federal Security Service, were observing her, waiting for a ripple, watching for an email or postcard from abroad, or an inexplicable, cryptic telephone call from a Moscow suburb, or an observed contact with a foreigner. But there were no ripples. Dominika was normal in her patterns; there was nothing for them to see.<br> <br>So they placed a handsome physical trainer to bump her during the &#x201c;mandatory&#x201d; self-defense course run in an old mansion in Domodedovo, on Varshavskaya Ulitsa off the MKAD ring road. The moldy, spavined house with creaky staircases and a green-streaked copper roof was nestled in an unkempt botanical garden hidden behind a wall with a crooked sign reading VILAR INSTITUTE OF OFFICINAL PLANTS. A few bored class participants&#x2014;a florid Customs Service woman and two overage border guards&#x2014;sat and smoked on benches along the walls of the glassed-in winter garden that served as the practice area.<br> <br>Daniil, the trainer, was a tall, blond Great Russian, about thirty-five years old and imperially slim, with sturdy wrists and pianist&#x2019;s hands. His features were delicate: Jawline, cheek, and brow were finely formed, and the impossibly long lashes above the sleepy blue eyes could stir the potted palm fronds in the winter garden from across the room. Dominika knew there was no such thing as a mandatory self-defense class in SVR, and that Daniil most likely was a ringer dispatched to casually ask questions and eventually elicit from an unwary Dominika that she had colluded with a foreign intelligence service, or passed state secrets, or seduced multiple debauched partners in hot upper berths of swaying midnight trains. It didn&#x2019;t matter what transgressions they harvested. The counterintelligence hounds couldn&#x2019;t define treason, but they&#x2019;d know it when they saw it.<br> <br>She certainly was not expecting to be taught anything along the lines of close-quarters fighting techniques. On the first day, with dappled sunlight coming through the grimy glass ceiling of the winter garden, Dominika was intrigued to see a pale-blue aura of artful thought and soul swirling around Daniil&#x2019;s head and from the tips of his fingers. She was additionally surprised when Daniil began instructing her in Sistema Rukopashnogo Boya, the Russian hand-to-hand combat system, medieval, brutal, rooted in tenth-century Cossack tradition with mystical connections to the Orthodox Church. It was normally taught only to Russian military personnel.<br> <br>She had seen the Spetsnaz assassin use the same moves in the blood-splattered Athens hotel room, not recognizing them for what they were, but horrified at their buttery efficiency. Daniil spared her nothing in training, and she found she enjoyed physically working her body again, remembering the long-ago discipline of her cherished dancing career, the career They had taken away from her. Sistema put a premium on flexibility, ballistic speed, and knowledge of vulnerable points on the human body. As Daniil demonstrated joint locks and submission holds, his face close to Dominika&#x2019;s, he saw something in her fifty-fathom eyes he wouldn&#x2019;t want to stir up unnecessarily.<br> <br>After two weeks, Dominika was mastering strikes and throws that would have taken other students months to learn. She had initially covered her mouth and laughed at the bent-leg monkey walk used to close with an opponent in combat, and the swirling shoulder shrug that preceded a devastating hand strike. Now, she was knocking Daniil down on the mat as often as he dumped her. In the dusty afternoon light of the room, Dominika watched Daniil&#x2019;s back muscles flex as he demonstrated a new technique and she idly wondered about him. The way he moved, he could have been a ballet dancer, or a gymnast. How had he gotten into the killing martial arts? Was he Spetsnaz, from a Vympel group? She had noticed, with the eye of a Sparrow&#x2014;a trained seductress of the state&#x2014;that his ring finger was significantly longer than his index finger. The likelihood existed therefore, according to the warty matrons at Sparrow School, of above-average-sized courting tackle.<br> <br>Estimating the size of a man was not the only thing Dominika had learned at State School Four, Sparrow School, the secret sexpionage academy that trained women in the art of seduction. The classrooms and auditoria in the walled, peeling mansion in the pine forest outside the city of Kazan on the banks of the Volga were in her mind still. She could hear the droning clinical lectures on human sexuality and love. She could see the jumpy, roiling films of coitus and perversion. The lists of sexual techniques, numbered in the hundreds, endlessly memorized and practiced&#x2014;No. 88, &#x201c;Butterfly wings&#x201d;; No. 42, &#x201c;String of pearls&#x201d;; No. 32, &#x201c;The carpet tack&#x201d;&#x2014;would come back to her, uninvited thoughts of the numb days and evil nights, and everything sprinkled with rose water to cloak the musk of rampant male and lathered female, and the dirty-nailed hands squeezing her thighs, and the drops of sweat that hung from the fleshy noses that inevitably, unavoidably, would drip onto her face. She had endured it to spite the svini, the pigs, all of them, who thought she would lie on her back and open her legs. And she would now show them how wrong they were.<br> <br>Calm down, she told herself. She was fighting the building stress of being back in Russia&#x2019;s service, in the embrace of the Motherland, the start of an impossibly risky existence. There was additional anguish: She didn&#x2019;t know whether the man she loved was still alive. And if he was still breathing, her love was a secret she would have to guard to her core, because there was the small detail that he was an American case officer of CIA. She waited for the overdue start of Daniil&#x2019;s sly elicitation, plausible after the earned familiarity of fourteen days of physical training. She would have to be exceedingly careful&#x2014;no baiting, no sarcasm&#x2014;but it was also an opening for a well-timed bit of dezinformatsiya, deception, perhaps a sly hint about her admiration for President Putin. Everything she told Daniil would go back to the FSB, and then the Center, and be compiled with all the other pieces of the &#x201c;welcome home&#x201d; investigation, and ultimately determine whether she would retain her status as an operupolnomochenny, an operations officer. But my, those eyelashes.<br> <br><br> <br>Dominika held her head erect, elegant on a long neck, as she pushed through the musky velvet curtain into the La Diva club. The bouncer at the inner door looked with professional approval at her little black dress, then glanced briefly into her tiny black satin clutch, barely large enough to hold a lipstick and wafer-thin smartphone. He pulled the heavy curtain aside and motioned her to enter. No weapons, he thought. Mademoiselle Doudounes, Miss Big Chest, is clean.<br> <br>Captain Egorova was in fact more than able to dispense lethal force. The lipstick tube in her purse was an elektricheskiy pistolet, a single-shot electric gun, a recent update from SVR technical&#x2014;Line T&#x2014;laboratories, a new version of a venerable Cold War weapon. The disposable lipstick gun fired a murderously explosive 9mm Makarov cartridge accurately out to two meters&#x2014;the bullet had a compressed metal dust core that expanded massively on contact. The only sound at discharge was a single loud click.<br> <br>Dominika scanned the black-lit interior of the club, a large semicircular room filled with chipped tables in the center and tired leatherette booths along the walls. A low stage with old-timey footlights stood dark and empty. Her target, Parvis Jamshidi, sat alone in a center booth pensively looking up at the ceiling. Dominika did a second quick scan, quartering the room, focusing on the far corners: No obvious countersurveillance or lounging bodyguard. She weaved between the tables toward Jamshidi&#x2019;s booth, ignoring the snapped fingers of a fat man at a table, signaling her to come over, either to order another petit jaune or to suggest they go together for thirty minutes to the Chat Noir Design Hotel down the block.<br> <br>She was keyed up as the familiar feel of the hunt, of contact with the opposition, rose in her throat, tightened across her chest, and sw...</p><h2>Kingdom Parables/Favorite Bible Parables for Children</h2><p>The parables of Jesus, including such familiar episodes as &#34;The Good Samaritan&#34; and &#34;The Prodigal Son,&#34; are retold as folk tales with the characters depicted as animals</p><p></p><h2>Space, Time &amp; Medicine</h2><p>What we call modern physics says something entirely new about the world and how it behaves. For many years, these theories have been accepted as the most accurate descriptions we have ever had about our world. Nevertheless, medicine has been reluctant to incorporate these ideas into itself, continuing to view the body as a clockwork mechanism, in which illness is caused by a breakdown of "parts." <br><br>Drawing on his long experience in the practice of internal medicine and his knowledge of modern science, Dr. Dossey shows how medicine can and must be updated. Discussing the new theories of Bell, Godel, and others, he opens up startling questions for medicine: Could the brain be a hologram, in which every part contains the whole? Why have ordinary people been able to raise and lower blood pressure at will, control heart rate, body temperature, even one minute blood vessel, in a way no one can explain? What is the role of consciousness in health and illness? <br><br>Perhaps the most startling of Dr. Dossey's discussions concerns nonlinear time. There is evidence that our obsession with time and our belief that time "flows" (a belief refuted by the new physics) may profoundly affect our health. "Time sickness" is becoming an accepted medical concept, a possible cause of the greatest killer of all&#x2014;heart disease. Dr. Dossey presents remarkable clinical data showing that by changing their view of time, people have been able to positively affect the course of disease. <br><br>Just as the clockwork picture of the universe was abandoned in the onslaught of new data, our mechanistic view of health and illness will give way to new models which, too, will be more consistent with the true face of the universe.</p><p>Larry Dossey, M.D., is a physician of internal medicine.

Many have thought it to be largely a transaction that gets one to heaven. In this riveting book, N. T. Wright explains that God's salvation is radically more than this. At the heart of much vigorous debate on this topic is the term the apostle Paul uses in several of his letters to describe what happens to those in Christ--<em>justification.</em> Paul uses this dramatic image from the law court to declare that Christians are acquitted of the cosmic accusations against them. But justification goes beyond this in Paul's writings to offer a vision of God's future for the whole world as well as for his people. Here in one place Wright now offers a comprehensive account and defense of his perspective on this crucial doctrine. He provides a sweeping overview of the central points in the debate before launching into a thorough explanation of the key texts in Paul's writings. While fully cognizant of tradition and controversy, the final authority for his conclusions is the letters of Paul themselves. Along the way Wright responds to critics, such as John Piper, who have challenged what has come to be called the New Perspective. For Wright, what Paul means by <em>justification</em> is nothing less than God's unswerving commitment to the covenant promise he made to bless the whole world through Abraham and his family. This irenic response is an important contribution for those on both sides of the debate--and those still in between--to consider. Whether you're a fan of Wright's work or have read his critics and would like to know the other side of the story, here is a chance to interact with Wright's views on the issues at stake and form your own conclusions.</p><p>&#34;Frank theological table talk is sometimes a necessary endeavor. Tom Wright&#39;s Justification is his substantive reply to critical work by many, including John Piper, on the New Perspective. Wright correctly reminds us that this approach should be better called New or Fresh Perspectives. The goal is to open up the text concerning what it originally said in the first century, not change it. This book sets up a meaningful and significant conversation between the camps in this debate through its direct interaction with the critique. It should be read and reflected on, just as work on the other side should be. So I recommend this book and say, pull up a chair to the table and pay careful attention to the conversation. In the dialogue, all of us will learn more about what Paul and Scripture say about justification (and a few other things as well).&#34;Read an interview with N. T.

Declaring "We can do it and do it better," these women proved that poor mothers are the real experts on poverty. In 1972 they founded Operation Life, which was responsible for many firsts for the poor in Las Vegas-the first library, medical center, daycare center, job training, and senior citizen housing. By the late 1970s, Operation Life was bringing millions of dollars into the community. These women became influential in Washington, DC-respected and listened to by political heavyweights such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Ted Kennedy, and Jimmy Carter. Though they lost their funding with the country's move toward conservatism in the 1980s, their struggles and phenomenal triumphs still stand as a critical lesson about what can be achieved when those on welfare chart their own course.</p><p>Annelise Orleck is associate professor of history and women's and gender studies at Dartmouth College.

To some frontier, the edge, maybe, of everything possible. I don't know; I never tried to analyze it before. The fear I had was almost like an invitation, a challenge to go forward into something I knew nothing about. That's where I think my personal philosophy of life and my commitment to everything I believe in started, with that moment. I don't know, but I think it might be true. Who knows? What the fuck did I know about anything back then? In my mind I have always believed and thought since then that my motion had to be forward, away from the heat of that flame. </p><p> Looking back, I don't remember much of my first years -- I never liked to look back much anyway. But one thing I do know is that the year after I was born a bad tornado hit St. Louis and tore it all up. Seems like I remember something about that -- something in the bottom of my memory. Maybe that's why I have such a bad temper sometimes; that tornado left some of its violent creativity in me. Maybe it left some of its strong winds. You know, you need strong wind to play trumpet. I do believe in mystery and the supernatural and a tornado sure enough is mysterious and supernatural. </p><p> I was born May 26, 1926, in Alton, Illinois, a little river town up on the Mississippi River about twenty-five miles north of East St. Louis. I was named after my father; he was named after his father. That made me Miles Dewey Davis III, but everybody in my family called me Junior. I always hated that nickname. </p><p> My father was from Arkansas. He grew up there on a farm that his father, Miles Dewey Davis I, owned. My grandfather was a bookkeeper, so good at what he did he did it for white people and made a whole lot of money. He bought five hundred acres of land in Arkansas around the turn of the century. When he bought all that land, the white people in the area who had used him to straighten out their financial matters, their money books, turned against him. Ran him off his land. In their minds, a black man wasn't supposed to have all that land and all that money. He wasn't supposed to be smart, smarter than them. It hasn't changed too much; things are like that even today. </p><p> For most of my life my grandfather lived under threats from white men. He even used his son, my Uncle Frank, as a bodyguard to protect him from them. The Davises were always ahead of the game, my father and grandfather told me. And I believed them. They told me that people in our family were special people -- artists, businessmen, professionals, and musicians -- who played for the plantation owners back in the old days before slavery was over. These Davises played classical music, according to my grandfather. That's the reason my father couldn't play or listen to music after slavery was over, because my grandfather said, "They only let black people play in gin houses and honky-tonks." What he meant was that they -- the white people -- didn't want to listen to no black folks playing classical music anymore; they only wanted to hear them sing spirituals or the blues. Now, I don't know how true this is, but that's what my father told me. </p><p> My father also told me my grandfather told him that whenever he got some money, no matter where or who he got it from, to count it and see if it was all there. He said you can't trust no one when it comes to money, not even people in your family. One time my grandfather gave my father what he said was $1,000 and sent him to the bank with it. The bank was thirty miles away from where they lived. It was about 100 degrees in the shade -- summertime in Arkansas. And he had to walk and ride a horse. When my father got down there to the bank, he counted the money and there was only $950. He counted it again and got the same amount: $950. So he went on back home, so scared he was just about ready to shit in his pants. When he got back he went to my grandfather and said that he lost $50. So Grandpa just stood there and looked at him and said, "Did you count the money before you left? Do you know if it was all there?" My father said, no, he didn't count the money before he left. "That's right," my grandfather told him, "because I didn't give you nothing but $950. You didn't lose anything. But didn't I tell you to count the money, anybody's money, even mine? Here's $50. Count it. And then go ahead on back and put that money in the bank like I told you." Now what you got to keep in mind about all of this is that not only was the bank thirty miles away but it was hotter than a motherfucker. It was cold of my grandfather to do that. But sometimes you've got to be cold like that. It was a lesson my father never forgot and he passed it on to his kids. So today I count <i>all</i> my money. </p><p> My father, like my mother, Cleota Henry Davis, was born in 1900 in Arkansas. He went to elementary school there. My father and his brothers and sisters didn't go to high school, just skipped right over it and went straight to college. He graduated from Arkansas Baptist College, from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, and from Northwestern University's College of Dentistry, so my father received three degrees and I remember looking at them motherfuckers up on his office wall after I got older and saying, "Goddamn, I hope he won't ask me to do that." I also remember seeing a picture somewhere of his graduating class from Northwestern and counting only three black faces there. He was twenty-four when he graduated from Northwestern. </p><p> His brother, Ferdinand, went to Harvard and some college in Berlin. He was a year or two older than my father, and like my father, he skipped over high school. He went straight into college after passing the entrance exam with high scores. He was a brilliant guy also; used to talk to me all the time about Caesar and Hannibal, and black history. He traveled all over the world. He was more intellectual than my father, and a ladies' man and player, editor of a magazine called <i>Color.</i> He was so smart he made me feel almost dumb; he was the only person I knew growing up who made me feel this way. Uncle Ferdinand was something else. I loved being around him, hearing him talk and tell stories about his travels, his women. And he was stylish as a motherfucker, too. I hung around him so n that my mother would get mad. </p><p> My father got out of Northwestern and married my mother. She played the violin and the piano. Her mother had been an organ teacher in Arkansas. She never talked much about her father, so I don't know much about her side of the family, never did, never asked either. I don't know why that is. From what I have heard of them, though, and the ones I did meet, they seemed to be middle class and a little uppity in their attitudes. </p><p> My mother was a beautiful woman. She had a whole lot of style, with an East Indian, Carmen McRae look, and dark, nut-brown, smooth skin. High cheekbones and Indian-like hair. Big beautiful eyes. Me and my brother Vernon looked like her. She had mink coats, diamonds; she was a very glamorous woman who was into all kinds of hats and things, and all my mother's friends seemed just as glamorous to me as she was. She always dressed to kill. I got my looks from my mother and also my love of clothes and sense of style. I guess you could say I got whatever artistic talent I have from her also. </p><p> But I didn't get along with her too well. Maybe it was because we both had strong, independent personalities. We seemed to argue all the time. I loved my mother; she was something else. She didn't even know how to cook. But, like I said, I loved her even if we weren't close. She had her mind about the way I should be doing things and I had mine. I was this way even when I was young. I guess you could say I was more like my mother than my father. Although I've got some of him in me, too. </p><p> My father settled first in Alton, Illinois, where me and my sister Dorothy were born, then moved the family to East St. Louis, on 14th and Broadway, where my father had his dental practice up over Daut's Drugstore. At first we lived upstairs behind his office, in the back. </p><p> Another thing I think about with East St. Louis is that it was there, back in 1917, that those crazy, sick white people killed all those black people in a race riot. See, St. Louis and East St. Louis were -- and still are -- big packing-house towns, towns where they slaughter cows and pigs for grocery stores and supermarkets, restaurants and everything else. They ship the cows and pigs up from Texas or from wherever else it is that they come from and then they kill them and pack them up in St. Louis and East St. Louis. That's what the East St. Louis race riot in 1917 was supposed to be about: black workers replacing white workers in the packing houses. So, the white workers got mad and went on a rampage killing all them black people. That same year black men were fighting in World War I to help the United States save the world for democracy. They sent us to war to fight and die for them over there; killed us like nothing over here. And it's still like that today. Now, ain't that a bitch. Anyway, maybe some of remembering that is in my personality and comes out in the way I look at most white people. Not all, because there are some great white people. But the way they killed all them black people back then -- just shot them down like they were out shooting pigs or stray dogs. Shot them in their houses, shot babies and women. Burned down houses with people in them and hung some black men from lampposts. Anyway, black people there who survived used to talk about it. When I was coming up in East St. Louis, black people I knew never forgot what sick white people had done to them back in 1917. </p><p> My brother Vernon was born the year the stock market crashed and all the rich white men started jumping out of them Wall Street windows. It was 1929. We had been living in East St. Louis for about two years. My older sister, Dorothy, was five. There was just three of us, Dorothy, Vernon, and me in the middle. We have always been close all our lives, my sister and my brother, even when we are arguing. </p><p> The neighborhood was very nice, with row houses, something like the ones they have in Philadelphia or Baltimore. It was a pretty little city. It's not like that anymore. But I remember it was that way back then. The neighborhood was also integrated, with Jews and Germans and Armenians and Greeks living all around us. Catercorner across the street from the house was Golden Rule's Grocery Store, owned by Jews. On one side was a filling station, with ambulances coming in all the time, sirens blasting, to fill up with gas. Next door was my father's best friend, Dr. John Eubanks, who was a physician. Dr. Eubanks was so light he almost looked white. His wife, Alma, or Josephine, I forget which, was almost white, too. She was a fine lady, yellow, like Lena Horne, with curly black, shiny hair. My mother would send me over to their house to get something and his wife would be sitting there with her legs crossed, looking finer than a motherfucker. She had great legs and she didn't mind showing them either. As a matter of fact she looked good everywhere! Anyway, Uncle Johnny -- that's what we called her husband, Dr. Eubanks -- gave me my first trumpet. </p><p> Next to the drugstore under us, and before you got to Uncle Johnny's house, was a tavern owned by John Hoskins, a black man who everybody called Uncle Johnny Hoskins. He played saxophone in the back of his tavern. All the old-timers in the neighborhood went there to drink, talk, and listen to music. When I got older, I played there once or twice. Then there was a restaurant owned by a black man named Thigpen down the block. He sold good soul food; the place was real nice. His daughter Leticia and my sister, Dorothy, were good friends. Next to the restaurant was a German lady who owned a dry goods store. This was all on Broadway going toward the Mississippi River. And there was the Deluxe Theatre, a neighborhood movie theater on 15th going toward Bond Street, away from the river. All along 15th paralleling the river toward Bond were all kinds of stores and places like that owned by blacks, or Jews, or Germans, or Greeks, or Armenians, who had most of the cleaning places. </p><p> Over on 16th and Broadway this Greek family owned a fish market and made the best jack salmon sandwiches in East St. Louis. I was friends with the son of the guy who owned it. His name was Leo. Everytime I'd see him, as we got bigger, we'd wrestle. We were about six. But he died when the house he lived in burned down. I remember them bringing him out on a stretcher with his skin all peeling off. He was burnt like a hot dog when you fry it. It was grotesque, horrible-looking shit, man. Later, when somebody asked me about that and whether Leo said anything to me when they brought him out, I remember saying, "He didn't say, 'Hello, Miles, how you doing, let's wrestle,' or nothing like that." Anyway, that was shocking to me because we were both around the same age, though I think he was a little older. He was a nice little cat. I used to have a lot of fun with him. </p><p> The first school I went to was John Robinson. It was located on 15th and Bond. Dorothy, my sister, went one year at a Catholic school, then transferred over to John Robinson, too. I met my first best friend in the first grade there. His name was Millard Curtis, and for years after we met we went almost everywhere together. We were the same age. I had other good friends in East St. Louis later, as I got more into music -- musician friends -- because Millard didn't play music. But I knew him the longest and we did so many things together that we were almost like brothers. </p><p> I'm pretty sure Millard came to my sixth birthday party. I remember this birthday party because my boys, guys I was hanging out with at the time, said to me, let's go hang out on the runway -- the wooden scaffolding that runs across sign boards, them billboards that have them ads all pasted over them. We would go and climb up on them, sit on the scaffolds with our feet dangling down in the air and eat crackers and potted ham. Anyway, my boys told me we might as well go do this because later I was having a birthday party, so wasn't none of them going to school that day. See, it was supposed to be a surprise birthday party, but all of them knew it and told me all about what was happening. Anyway, I think I was six; I could have been seven. I remember this cute little girl named Velma Brooks being at the party. Her and a whole lot of other pretty little girls with short dresses, like miniskirts...</p></p><h2>Living Dead Girl</h2><p><i>Once upon a time, I was a little girl who disappeared. <br> <br> Once upon a time, my name was not Alice. <br> <br> Once upon a time, I didn't know how lucky I was.</i> <br><br> When Alice was ten, Ray took her away from her family, her friends -- her life.

Across from a strip mall with nail places and a cash-loan store that advertises on TV all the time. There's also a drugstore and tiny restaurants, every one opening and closing within months. </p><p> Shady Pines is nice enough, if it's all you can afford. The stairs are chipped but solid, the washing machines always work, and management picks up the trash once a week. </p><p> A few mothers sit outside their buildings, resting in fraying lawn chairs and talking over each other while their children run around, playing. One dog lies sleeping in the sun, twitching its tail when a child comes over and pats the top of its head before running away, giggling. </p><p> That man in the far building, the car guy, is outside, a pile of parts scattered on the black ooze of the parking lot around him. Car guy has been here since you moved in, but you never see him except for sunny weekends, when he works on his car. </p><p> Not that he ever drives it. </p><p> He's a strange one, that's for sure, living alone, always with that car, not really ever talking to anyone, but every place has one weirdo, and at least car guy cleans up after himself. He's almost obsessive about it. </p><p> Still, see how he sighs when that man, the one whose daughter is quiet and, sadly, a little slow, pulls into the space next to his? See how he watches the girl get out of the car? She's a skinny little thing, always hunching over a bit, like she's taller than she thinks she is. Homeschooled, of course, because of how she is, or so someone once told you when you were getting the mail, and there are no secrets around here, not with everyone living so close together. </p><p> She walks slowly across the lot, trailing behind her father, who waits patiently for her to get to the building door, holding it open even though he's carrying all the bags. She doesn't even say thank you, but what can you expect? Kids never know how good they have it. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2008 by Elizabeth Spencer </p><p> </p> 2 <p> </p><p> This is how things are: </p><p> Cold, from the grocery store, from the dairy aisle you walked down to pick up the yogurt, from the frozen-food aisle, its cases filled deep with frozen pizzas and ice cream in large round containers. </p><p> Cold, getting out of the truck, foot clinking over something metallic, piece of a car lying on the ground. </p><p> Don't stop to look. </p><p> Walk up the stairs, Ray's footsteps behind you. Listen to him pause, smiling at the one open apartment door, the Indian family on the second floor, always children running in and out, sometimes their TV turned up so loud at night Ray has to go down there and knock on the door, say please turn it down? Thank you so much. </p><p> "Was that guy in the parking lot looking at you?" Ray says when you walk into the apartment, as soon as the door thunks closed and he's turned the locks, one, two, three. Better safe than sorry, he always says. </p><p> Shake your head no, no. Even if he did look, it would never be at you. </p><p> No one ever really looks at you. </p><p> Ray puts the groceries away, yogurt in the fridge, his oatmeal in its individual packets in the cabinet above the sink. Five apples, one for each day when he comes home from work. Five TV dinners you'll heat up at night for him to eat unless he brings something home. </p><p> He comes over to the sofa. Holds out a glass of water so cold the sides are frosty, ice cubes clinking inside. You've pulled your skirt up to your waist, arms resting by your sides, palms up and open.

Why is he hit with anxiety whenever he has to make a presentation?<br><br>Stacey has been trying one therapist after another for years to discover why she has an almost constant feeling of dread, fears of abandonment and an eating disorder. Strangest of all, she has repeated images of the color red and a candle. It makes no sense to her, but it has been going on for as long as she can remember.<br><br>Interestingly, there is a simple explanation for their problems that involves how the brain itself functions. In this book, we will explore both the reasons for suffering and what we can do about it.<br><br>WHY WE SUFFER<br><br>The truth is we all suffer at one time or another. Situations arise all the time that affect us negatively. But when we continue to have pain long after the experience itself has passed, it is because the hardwiring of our brains influences our minds. Let's try the following experiment so you can see for yourself. I'll give a single sentence and you just notice the first thing that pops into your mind:<br><br>Roses are red<br><br>The odds are that the first thing to come up was: Violets are blue. For people born in the United States, it's basically the equivalent of a knee- jerk response. This is an important concept, since mental responses are based on physical reactions. Your brain is programmed to respond in the same way as the rest of your body. Regardless of age or gender, when your knee is hit in a certain way your leg will jerk. Similarly, regardless of intention, your mind also reacts automatically. For instance, when is the last time you heard that rhyme? You probably learned it in childhood. So, if you don't live with young children, it was likely many, many years ago. But it came up automatically nonetheless. These types of automatic responses can be wonderful and useful, and show the power of our minds, but they don't always serve us.<br><br>Take a look at the sentences themselves. Your response to "Roses are red" wasn't a critical evaluation of its meaning. Your mind just moved along with a response as if it was true. But roses aren't always red. They are also yellow, pink, purple and most any color you can think of. However, that unexamined sentence looks just fine at first glance. And how about the second one: Violets are blue. Are they really? No, actually they are purple. But the line will come up whether it's true or not. Now, probably the sentence didn't cause you any kind of distress. But that same type of automatic response also causes a wide range of problems that disrupt happiness, families and communities. The same mind/brain processes that allow us to recognize a rhyme, or sing along with a tune we haven't heard in 20 years, are the ones that can also drown us in the misery of anxiety, depression, heartache and at times physical pain.<br><br>The nursery rhyme has even more to offer. Remember the line that comes after "Violets are blue"? "Sugar is sweet and so are you." Lovely sentiment, and it also comes to mind automatically. But as we all know, while sugar is surely sweet, people are lots more complicated. Everyone is a mixture of sweet, sour and every flavor and variation under the sun. At some point, everyone is angry, sad, jealous, bitter, hurt, insecure, happy or sweet. And when we are, we act accordingly. One moment we cherish the one we are with and cover them with kisses. A day later we may explode and yell at them in frustration. So, basically, some of what we've learned growing up is true, but just as with all the other experiences we've had through childhood, other things are not. Often as youngsters we can't tell the difference, and what we take to be real--such as believing we are inferior because we are bullied or rejected, or thinking we are responsible for our parents' divorce--are really just misperceptions. Nevertheless, these experiences can have effects that come up automatically throughout the rest of our lives, outside our conscious control.<br><br>Every experience we've had in our lives has become a building block in our inner world, governing our reactions to everything and every person we encounter. When we "learn" something, the experience is physically stored within networks of brain cells called "neurons." These networks actually form our unconscious mind, determining how our brain interprets the world around us and governing how we feel from moment to moment. These memories include experiences that took place years ago, and our conscious mind is often unaware that they have any impact on us at all. But since the memories are physically stored in the brain, they can pop up outside our control in response to "Roses are red," just as they color our view of every new situation we encounter. They can cause us to feel unattractive when we're not. Depressed when everyone else around us is happy. And they can leave us feeling heartsick if someone leaves us--even if we know consciously that the person is terrible for us and continuing the relationship would be a big mistake. Basically, many of the feelings and actions that undermine our happiness are symptoms that stem from this memory system that forms the unconscious.<br><br>Let's take the first case from page 1:<br><br>Why would a beautiful, intelligent woman keep picking the wrong men, and then when they try to break up with her, throw herself on the floor clutching their legs, begging them not to leave?<br><br>Justine has no problems getting boyfriends. Her problem is keeping them. Now 25 years old, she generally picks men with an "edge" who are emotionally unavailable. Then every time she gets into a relationship, she begins acting clingy and her boyfriend eventually breaks up with her. When this happens, she begins to cry hysterically, falling to her knees and putting her arms around the man's legs, pleading with him not to leave her. In therapy, the cause of this was tracked back to something that happened on a Sunday evening when she was 6 years old. Justine was living with her parents in a two-story house. On that night there was a severe thunderstorm, causing her to become very frightened. Upstairs in her bedroom, she began crying and yelling for her mommy and daddy to come to her. However, they were in the kitchen on the first floor. The storm drowned out her screams, and they didn't hear her. They never came to her rescue and she eventually cried herself to sleep.<br><br>How could something as common as this be responsible for her problems? All of us have experienced loud storms sometime in childhood, but only some of us will remain negatively affected by it. We'll go into the detailed reasons for this in later chapters. For now, it's sufficient to know that when negative reactions and behaviors in the present can be tracked directly back to an earlier memory, we define those memories as "unprocessed"--meaning that they are stored in the brain in a way that still holds the emotions, physical sensations and beliefs that were experienced earlier in life. That stormy night Justine was intensely frightened as a child, and had the belief that she was in danger. Her parents didn't come when she cried for them, which also gave her the feeling that she would be abandoned if she really needed them. This memory, stored in her brain with the intense fear she experienced at 6 years old, is stimulated whenever a boyfriend breaks up with her. At this point, she no longer functions as a mature and successful 25-year-old, but instead as a frightened little girl left a lone in the dark. We can see the connection, given that the storm and a breakup are both associated with aloneness and abandonment. As such, she unconsciously experiences the breakup as "being in danger."<br><br>We experience these types of connections all the time. It's generally the reason for all of the characteristics we love or hate in ourselves and the people around us. It's simply part of the way the brain functions in order to make sense of the world. But identifying the memory connections is just the first step in changing how we think, act or feel. It's not just understanding where something comes from, but also knowing what to do about it that's important. In the course of this book we will be exploring how to identify the memories that underlie personal and relationship problems; what we can do to help manage them on our own; and how to recognize when further professional help would be useful.<br><br>We'll also explore the workings of the mind--the intricate connections that form our consciousness--through stories contributed by some of the more than 70,000 clinicians worldwide who practice a form of therapy known as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). Millions of people have been helped by the therapy over the past 20 years, and many of them are giving detailed reports in this book in order to help "demystify" the change process. As research has shown, major changes can take place within even one EMDR reprocessing session. The clients' reports allow us a "window into the brain," since the connections they made answer so many questions about why we react to the world in different ways.<br><br>EMDR therapy targets the unprocessed memories that contain the negative emotions, sensations and beliefs. By activating the brain's information processing system (which will be explained in Chapter 2), the old memories can then be "digested." Meaning what is useful is learned, what's useless is discarded, and the memory is now stored in a way that is no longer damaging. For instance, Justine's clinician focused on the thunderstorm along with the feeling she had of being alone and in danger. Once the memory of the thunderstorm was processed, the childhood sensations of terror disappeared and were replaced by the feeling of safety, and the belief that as an adult she could take care of herself. Along with that, the boyfriend problem resolved as her new sense of self resulted in her making different romantic choices. Of course there would be more memories that might have to be dealt with if Justine's parents had been generally abusive or neglectful. But regardless of the number of memories involved, basically we are entering into the person's "unconscious" mind with this form of therapy, in a way that can allow insights, connections and change to occur rapidly within the reprocessing sessions.<br><br>WHAT IS THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND?<br><br>When most people think of the unconscious, they think of psychoanalysis and movies that involve a Freudian view of psychic conflicts, and symbolic dreams and gestures. From the psychoanalytic perspective it generally takes years of talk therapy and "working through" to gain insight and mastery over forces that are hidden from view. This form of therapy can have great value. But Freud published first in 1900, and many things have changed since then. In the past century there have been new advances in neurobiological technologies that have expanded our understanding of what these "forces" actually are. The examination of the unconscious we are dealing with in this book is one that is based on the workings of the brain itself. Through an understanding of how experiences lay the physical groundwork for our emotional and physical reactions, we can determine how our "stuck" points and knee-jerk mental responses came about and what to do about them.<br><br>For instance, let's take the second case:<br><br>Ben is a successful businessman. Why is he hit with anxiety whenever he has to make a presentation? Here's how he described it:<br><br>"As long as I can remember, I've had anxiety about doing any performance in front of a group of people. My palms sweat, my voice becomes unpredictable, my heart beats fast and I have thoughts like, 'I'm an idiot. I can't do this. Everyone will hate me.' It sometimes felt as though my life was at risk. Sounds ridiculous, but it was so true. As I went through school, there were many times in the normal course of events when I had to make public presentations. In my professional career the same thing happened. I always made it through these events, but not happily. In fact, I suffered before and after every event, and tediously went over every detail with my loved ones, which, as you might imagine, did not delight them. No matter what I tried, nothing seemed to fix this problem. I tried many types of therapy. Sometimes it seemed a little better, but it always came roaring back."<br><br>Ben entered into EMDR therapy and used a variety of procedures that we'll learn in this book to identify the source of his problem and change his reactions. Here's what he discovered: "It turns out the cause was something that happened to me when I was no more than 3 1/2 years old. I was walking with my grandfather on his farm in western North Carolina. My memory here is as if I was looking up, like a very small child. I don't remember chattering away to my grandfather, but if family stories can be trusted, I probably was. We met a strange man on the road. He was old, bent, angry looking, with very hairy nostrils. He said to my grandfather in his mountain drawl, 'Well, howdy, if I had a youn-gun' talked as much as that un, I'd drown him in the creek.' I slipped behind my grandfather's denim-covered leg, peered up the man's nostrils and shut up. I knew that unwanted kittens were in fact 'drowned in the creek.' It did not seem safe to chatter in front of strangers."</p><h2>Hot Pursuit (A Stone Barrington Novel)</h2><p><b>Stone Barrington is back in the exciting new adventure from perennial fan favorite Stuart Woods.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s not often that Stone Barrington finds a woman as accustomed to the jet-set lifestyle as he, so he&#x2019;s pleasantly surprised when he meets a gorgeous pilot who&#x2019;s soon moving to New York, and available for closer acquaintance.

An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in New York City, Florida, and Maine.<p></p><p>1</p><p>STONE BARRINGTON STOOD on a wide expanse of tarmac, leaning into thirty knots of icy wind, holding his hat on his head, his trench coat inadequate to the task of keeping his body temperature in the normal range. It was January in Wichita.</p><p>He watched as a thing of beauty made a turn and rolled toward him. It bore his tail number, but not on the tail&#x2014;on the engine nacelles. Its white fuselage bore stripes of blue and red, sweeping back to a night-blue tail, emblazoned with stars. It was his brand-new Citation M2, for which he had waited two years. The form of the delivery pilot, a man named Pat Frank, could be seen in the pilot&#x2019;s seat, having flown the twenty-minute flight from the factory, in Independence, Kansas.</p><p>A lineman ran forward and chocked the nosewheel, and the pilot cut the engines, their dying whine leaving the howl of the wind as the only noise on the ramp.</p><p>Stone had spent the past sixteen days in the classroom and the simulator; the content of his life had shrunk to sweating out instruction all day, then ordering room service at night and falling asleep in front of the TV. He wanted the real airplane and he wanted New York. Now.</p><p>The door of the airplane swung open and a figure kicked the folding steps down, and Stone got his first surprise of the day. The ferry pilot descended onto the tarmac, and her blond hair streamed with the wind. &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; she said, holding out a hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Pat Frank. Can we get out of this wind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Follow me,&#x201d; Stone said, running for the airplane and climbing the steps. He glanced into the cockpit, which was completely familiar to him, since the three fourteen-inch screens of the Garmin 3000 avionics and the accompanying switches and throttles were identical to those in the simulator. He sank into one of the four comfortable passenger seats and waved Ms. Pat Frank to a seat facing him. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re the hand-holder my insurance company sent to make my first flight with me,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I am that,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;At the very least. You may recall that you paid me to do the acceptance flights and inspections for you, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I thought I was signing checks to some grizzled veteran of the airlines, corporate flying, and, maybe, FedEx.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all that, except the grizzled part,&#x201d; she said, smiling, revealing perfect teeth set off by her red lipstick. The soft, goatskin leather jacket, zipped up against the weather, could not conceal her ample breasts. &#x201c;All we need is fuel and a flight plan filed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve taken care of both.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope to God you don&#x2019;t want to do the walk-around inspection in this wind,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already done it this morning in a nice warm hangar, and if you want to get me off this airplane you&#x2019;re going to have to drag me.&#x201d;</p><p>A lineman stuck his head into the cabin. &#x201c;Fuel&#x2019;s on the way,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You want me to stow your bags, Mr. Barrington?&#x201d;</p><p>Pat Frank handed him a key. &#x201c;Up front, please, and kindly remove the ten bags of lead shot first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lead shot?&#x201d; Stone asked, baffled.</p><p>&#x201c;Weight and balance,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My hundred and twenty pounds weren&#x2019;t enough to get us into the envelope. With you aboard, no problem, unless you have plans to have some slip of a girl fly the airplane alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t think of one,&#x201d; Stone replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, if you&#x2019;ve already been to the can, let&#x2019;s button this thing up, then climb into the cockpit and see if we can make it fly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After you,&#x201d; Stone said, stripping off his trench coat.</p><p>She pulled up the steps, closed the door, and swung the lever that locked it. In a moment, she was in the copilot&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>Stone went forward and, with some difficulty, managed to get his six-foot-two frame into the pilot&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>Pat helped him with adjusting the seat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s snug, but you&#x2019;ll get used to it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;For some reason, Cessna puts all the room in the rear, where the passengers sit&#x2014;not where the owner-pilots for whom this airplane was intended fly the thing.&#x201d;</p><p>She read out the pre-start checklist, he flipped the appropriate switches, then he turned on the power and the three glass panels slowly came to life, along with the two smaller screens just ahead of the throttles, called the GTUs. These were the iPad-like units with which most of the airplane&#x2019;s systems were operated. Stone had spent a week playing with a computer-simulated version, memorizing the patterns and trying to forget the old G-1000 in his former airplane.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you have a Mustang before?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep, I gave it to my son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope he&#x2019;s older than eight,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s quite a toy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s twelve, or so, and he&#x2019;s already type-rated.&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;I never heard of a father giving his son a jet airplane.&#x201d; She watched as he managed to tap a flight plan into the GTU, then run the system checks. &#x201c;Not bad for a first flight,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;They drilled me well in class. Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll need your help before long.&#x201d;</p><p>Outside, the fuel truck drove away, and the lineman signaled that the chocks had been pulled. Stone pulled the hand brake and started the engines. When all systems were running smoothly, he listened to ATIS, the tower&#x2019;s recorded weather report, then called clearance delivery, adjusting the microphone attached to his Bose headset. &#x201c;Wichita clearance delivery, November One Two Three Tango Foxtrot is IFR to Tango Echo Bravo. Do you have a clearance for me?&#x201d;</p><p>They did, and Stone copied it down and read it back. It included a departure procedure, and he inserted that into his electronic flight plan, then called for permission to taxi. &#x201c;Thank God that wind is right down the runway,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel like fighting it.&#x201d; He taxied to the end of the runway, and Pat read out the pre-takeoff checklist. With every switch in its proper position, he asked permission to take off and was cleared. He rolled onto the runway, lined up with the centerline, centered the heading bug, flipped on the pitot heat switches, and pushed the throttles to the firewall.</p><p>&#x201c;Airspeed&#x2019;s alive,&#x201d; Pat said after a few seconds, then, &#x201c;Seventy knots&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. aaaand rotate!&#x201d;</p><p>Stone put both hands on the yoke and pulled back until two V-bars on the display in front of him mated, showing that he had achieved the proper climb angle.</p><p>&#x201c;Positive rate of climb,&#x201d; Pat said.</p><p>Stone raised the landing gear flaps.</p><p>&#x201c;Four hundred fifty feet,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>He pressed the button that turned on the autopilot, then removed his hands from the yoke. They were given an initial climb to ten thousand feet, and he was told to switch to Wichita departure. The frequency was already entered into the G-3000; all he had to do was tap the glass panel at the proper spot. &#x201c;Wichita departure, N123TF with you out of three thousand for one zero thousand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;N123TF, cleared on course. Climb and maintain flight level 410.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone repeated the instruction and pressed the NAV button to tell the autopilot to follow the flight plan, then he dialed forty-one thousand feet into the computer, pressed the Flight Level Control button, and sat back.</p><p>He put behind him the claustrophobic previous two weeks and room-service food, and reveled in his new airplane as it climbed quickly to FL 410.</p><p>&#x201c;Does your wife fly?&#x201d; Pat asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a widower,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;For some years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My condolences.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you. Why don&#x2019;t you delay your return to Wichita, and let&#x2019;s have dinner tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m moving into a new apartment tomorrow in New York,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;d love to.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>THE FLIGHT was predictably smooth for the first hour. They grilled each other, this being more of a first date than a qualifying flight for the insurance company. Pat was from a small town in Georgia, Delano, which somehow had a familiar ring for Stone. She had started flying after college, had flown air taxi and package delivery, then corporate jets, then for an airline. By the time that went bust, she had made captain, and she took herself to another airline. Finally, she had made the break.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starting a business,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling it The Pat Frank Flight Department, something that the charterers and the corporates have as a matter of course, but not the owner-flown jets. I&#x2019;ll do all the paperwork, keep the maintenance schedule, update the logbooks weekly, et cetera, et cetera.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could use a service like that,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;My secretary has been doing all the work, but since she knows nothing about airplanes, it&#x2019;s hard for her. You&#x2019;re hired.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great! My first client! Of course, I can&#x2019;t have dinner with you tonight, for professional reasons.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re fired,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I guess I can make an exception, your being my first client and all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re rehired.&#x201d; Stone looked at the multi-function display before him. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the weather the forecast predicted,&#x201d; he said, pointing at a green mass ahead of them that was dotted with yellow areas. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll fly over the bulk of it, but when we start our descent on the arrival procedure, we&#x2019;ll have to contend with it and maybe with some ice, too. And we&#x2019;ll need an instrument approach.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your airplane is equipped to deal with it,&#x201d; she reminded him.</p><p>Stone tapped an icon or two and brought up the weather at Teterboro. &#x201c;Six-hundred-foot ceiling, six miles of visibility, wind 040 at twelve, gusting twenty,&#x201d; he read. &#x201c;No problem. We&#x2019;ll keep an eye on it, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was some light snow in the forecast, too,&#x201d; Pat said.</p><p>They entered into the arrival procedure, a loop to the north, then back to the south, that the air traffic controllers used to line up and keep distance between the conga line of airplanes that would be landing at TEB. ATC gave them a lower altitude, and Stone turned on the ice prevention systems that heated the leading edges of the wings and tail and the windshield. Five minutes later they were in Instrument Meteorological Conditions and blind, except for their instruments. They continued their descent on the arrival, and at the end of it they were vectored to the Instrument Landing System for runway 6 at Teterboro. ATIS told them that the weather had deteriorated to three hundred feet and two miles of visibility, with blowing snow.</p><p>Once established on the ILS, Stone watched the indicator for the glide slope and put down the landing gear. The three green lights that indicated that the tricycle gears were down did not come on. &#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; he said, then recycled the gear switch. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;re going to have to blow the gear down.&#x201d; There was a tank of nitrogen aboard that could be used to force the gear down in the event of a hydraulic failure.</p><p>Pat reached forward and twisted the knob that selected night or day flying to &#x201c;day,&#x201d; and the three green gear lights appeared. &#x201c;Some ass turned it to &#x2018;night,&#x2019;&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And the daylight washed out the dimmed lights.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a relief,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>She read out the landing checklist, and the autopilot flew them down the glide slope; all Stone had to do was control the airspeed. At three hundred feet they broke out of the clouds, into light snow, and the runway lay directly ahead of them. At 160 feet, Stone turned off the autopilot and landed the airplane smoothly by hand.</p><p>&#x201c;And your first landing is a greaser!&#x201d; Pat said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve just passed your insurance check ride!&#x201d;</p><p>Stone called ground control, requested taxi to Jet Aviation, where he kept the airplane, and was given the route. Five minutes later Pat was reading the shutdown checklist, and he was shutting down the engines and switching everything off. He noted the flight time on the Hobbs meter and entered it into his logbook. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re home,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Pat left the cockpit, opened the airplane&#x2019;s door, and kicked down the steps, which lowered themselves gently into place. Stone went to the rear luggage compartment, switched off the battery to conserve power, and handed a lineman the engine and pitot covers for installation. He locked up and went to the forward luggage compartment, removed his and Pat&#x2019;s bags, and handed them to another lineman, who put them onto a cart.</p><p>&#x201c;Put her in the barn,&#x201d; Stone said to the other lineman, then he and Pat followed their luggage through the Jet Aviation terminal and out to where Stone&#x2019;s factotum, Fred, waited with the Bentley.</p><p>&#x201c;Good flight, sir?&#x201d; Fred asked.</p><p>&#x201c;A great one, Fred. This is Pat Frank.&#x201d;</p><p>Fred tipped an imaginary cap, and they got into the car.</p><p>Pat produced her phone. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t book a hotel for tonight,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;I have guest rooms.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How kind you are!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Saves picking you up for dinner.&#x201d;</p><p>Half an hour later they were in the garage, and while Fred dealt with the luggage, they took the elevator to the third floor. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll put you in here,&#x201d; Stone said, showing her to the largest guest room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right down the hall.&#x201d; He looked at his watch: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got two hours to get gorgeous,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll meet in my study for a drink at seven&#x2014;it&#x2019;s on the first floor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How are we dressing?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You mean you have more than one dress in that little bag?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The option is jeans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wear the dress. See you at seven.&#x201d; He walked down the hall to the master suite.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>AT SEVEN he was reading the <i>New York Times</i> in his study when she walked in, clad in a tight LBD and sporting pearls and very high heels.</p><p>&#x201c;You got gorgeous,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;What would you like to drink?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you drinking?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bourbon. Knob Creek. I have gimlets and martinis already made and in the freezer, and most other drinks, but I can&#x2019;t make a banana daiquiri.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a Georgia girl,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have the bourbon.&#x201d;</p><p>He poured them both a drink. &#x201c;Some friends are meeting us at the restaurant,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Dino and Vivian Bacchetti. She&#x2019;s called Viv.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In my extreme youth I was a cop, and Dino was my partner. Now I&#x2019;m a failed cop, and Dino is the police commissioner of the City of New York.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you fail?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got shot in the knee, and I disagreed with my betters on the handling of an important case. They used the knee as an excuse to dump me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how did you go about becoming a lawyer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was already a law-school graduate. I took a cram course and passed the bar, and an old school buddy had a job waiting for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You make it sound so easy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was lucky. I had inherited this house from a great-aunt, my grandmother&#x2019;s sister, and I was renovating it, doing most of the work myself. I was more than a year into the job, my savings were gone, and I was in debt to the bank and a lot of building suppliers, when I ran into my old friend Bill Eggers, of Woodman &amp; Weld. The rest, as they say, is history.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A pretty successful history,&#x201d; she said, looking around. &#x201c;The place is beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fairly successful. When my wife died I came into some money that had been made by her first husband.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thus, the gift of a jet to your son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thus. How do you happen to be moving into an apartment in New York tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My sister got married and moved to the suburbs. She owned an apartment and rented it, until I could clear the decks for the move. The tenant&#x2019;s lease is up tomorrow. I&#x2019;ll probably buy the place from my sister, eventually.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d; Ston...</p></p><h2>The Marriage Builder</h2><p><p>Psychologist Larry Crabb cuts to the heart of the biblical view of marriage: the "one-flesh" relationship. He argues convincingly that the deepest needs of human personality -- security and significance -- ultimately cannot be satisfied by a marriage partner. We need to turn to the Lord, rather than our spouse, to satisfy our needs. This frees both partners for "soul oneness," a commitment to minister to our spouse's needs rather than manipulating them to meet our own needs. With "soul oneness" comes renewed "body oneness," where couples enjoy sexual pleasure as an expression and outgrowth of a personal relationship. The Marriage Builder also identifies three building blocks essential to constructing marriage: the grace of God, true marriage commitment, and acceptance of one's mate. Now for the first time, discussion questions have been added to aid couples who want to come to deeper understanding of marriage. Helpful to counselors and laypersons alike, The Marriage Builder is for anyone who longs to transform marriage from trial to triumph.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Larry Crabb is a well-known psychologist, conference and seminary speaker, Bible teacher, popular author, and founder/director of NewWay Ministries.

A flight attendant noticed the words &#39;The Goal of Marriage&#39; written at the top of a yellow pad of paper resting on the tray table in front of me. She asked what I was writing. When I told her I was starting a book on marriage, she said, &#39;Well, I&#39;m glad, because I really believe in marriage. After six years of living with a man, I decided that I wanted to be married. Since the fellow I was living with liked our no-strings-attached arrangement, I found somebody else who was willing to tie the knot, and we got married two months ago. So far it&#39;s great!&#39; I asked her why she preferred a marriage commitment to merely living together. She thought for a few seconds, then said, &#39;I think it&#39;s the commitment part I wanted. I married a man who seems to be really committed to loving me and working on a relationship. I never felt secure enough to really open up and try to get close with a man who wouldn&#39;t make any promises.&#39; This incident prompts two questions: (1) What was this woman&#39;s purpose in exchanging her live-in boyfriend for a husband? (2) How was she hoping to reach her objective? Consider a second example. A husband in his early thirties complained to me that his wife was a disappointment to him. She was pretty and personable, a good cook, and a devoted mother to their two children. But these qualities were offset by her constant criticizing, her impatient corrections and rebukes, and her negative attitude. Nothing he did seemed to satisfy her and, he added with a touch of noble frustration, he was the sort of husband many women would be delighted to have. This man&#39;s wife had been staring dejectedly at the floor the whole time he was speaking. When he stopped talking, she spoke without raising her head. &#39;What he says is true. I&#39;m an awful nag, and I do complain a lot. I just feel so unloved by Jimmy.&#39; When she raised her head, there was anger in her eyes. &#39;Sometimes he explodes at me, calling me awful names. He&#39;ll never pray with me. Sure, he smiles a lot, and he thinks that makes him a great husband, but I know he doesn&#39;t really accept me. His smiles always turn into pushy demands for sex; and when I won&#39;t give in to him, he throws a fit.&#39; Reflect on this couple and ask the same two questions: (1) What was each partner longing for from the other? (2) What were their strategies for gaining their desires? Think about one more illustration. A middle-aged couple---Christians, attractive, talented, financially comfortable, faithful, active church members---admitted that their marriage was in trouble. &#39;I feel like such a hypocrite,&#39; the wife stated. &#39;If you asked the people in our church to list the ten most happily married couples they know, our names would probably appear on every list. We&#39;re sociable, we entertain church people frequently in our beautiful home, we sing in the choir together. We really play the role---but our relationship is miserable. &#39;We get along---but from a distance. I can never tell him how I really feel about anything. He always gets mad and jumps at me, or he clams up for a couple days. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever had a really close relationship.&#39; Her husband responded, &#39;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that bad. We&#39;ve got a lot going for us: the kids are doing fine, my wife teaches Sunday school, the Lord is blessing my business. That&#39;s better than a lot of---&#39; I interrupted. &#39;How much do you really share yourself---your feelings, hopes, and dreams---with your wife?&#39; &#39;Well,&#39; he answered, &#39;whenever I try she usually doesn&#39;t seem all that interested, so I just don&#39;t bother.&#39; &#39;I&#39;d listen if you&#39;d really share with me!&#39; his wife blurted. &#39;But your idea of sharing is to lecture me on how things should be. Whenever I try to tell you how I feel, you always say something like &#39;I don&#39;t know why you feel like that.&#39; I think our communication is awful.&#39; Once more, consider the same two questions: (1) What do these emotionally divorced partners want from their marriage but have so far been unable to develop? (2) How are they trying to achieve what they both so deeply desire? The Need for Intimacy Let&#39;s deal with the first question: What was each of these people seeking? It is apparent that the flight attendant married in the hope that a relationship of mutual commitment would provide the intimacy she lacked with her live-in boyfriend. The frustrated husband wanted to feel a sense of oneness with his wife but believed her critical and rejecting spirit was getting in the way. He felt angry with her, much as I would feel toward someone who, after I had gone without food for several days, blocked my path to a table spread with good things to eat. His wife felt unable to give herself warmly to a man who seemed to use rather than accept her. She desperately wanted to be close to her husband, but felt a sense of dread at the prospect of moving toward a man who perhaps didn&#39;t really love her. The couple whose marriage was a well-decorated but empty package felt completely blocked from touching one another emotionally. The absence of real intimacy left a void for them---which she freely and bitterly acknowledged, but which he ignored by focusing on the external trappings of family success. The newlywed stewardess, the explosive husband and his critical wife, and the couple who could not communicate were all pursuing the same elusive goal: A deep experience of personal intimacy through relationship with a person of the opposite sex. Nothing reaches so deeply into the human personality as relationship. The fabric of biblical truth is woven from Genesis to Revelation with the thread of relationship: * Perfect relationships within the Trinity; * Broken relationships between God and humanity, Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel; * Loving relationships between Aquila and Priscilla, Ruth and Naomi, and Jesus and John; * Oppositional relationships between Jezebel and Elijah, and Jesus and the Pharisees; * Strained relationships between Abraham and Lot, and Paul and John Mark. The kinds of emotions that develop within relationships are also vividly portrayed in Scripture: * Agony over lost relationships---David weeping for Absalom; Jesus crying out, &#39;My God, why have you forsaken me?&#39;; * Bitter remorse from grieving a loved one---Peter after the cock crowed the third time; * The joy of reunion---Jacob meeting Joseph in Egypt; Jairus&#39;s daughter restored to her father; * The relaxed enjoyment of a comfortable relationship---Christ at the home of Mary and Martha.</p><h2>The Lady By His Side (Cynsters Next Generation)</h2><p>A marquess in need of the right bride. An earl&#x2019;s daughter in search of a purpose. A betrayal that ends in murder and balloons into a threat to the realm. Sebastian Cynster knows time is running out. If he doesn&#x2019;t choose a wife soon, his female relatives will line up to assist him. Yet the current debutantes do not appeal. Where is he to find the right lady to be his marchioness? Then Drake Varisey, eldest son of the Duke of Wolverstone, asks for Sebastian&#x2019;s aid. Having assumed his father&#x2019;s mantle in protecting queen and country, Drake must go to Ireland in pursuit of a dangerous plot. But he&#x2019;s received an urgent missive from Lord Ennis, an Irish peer&#x2014;Ennis has heard something Drake needs to know. Ennis insists Drake attends an upcoming house party at Ennis&#x2019;s Kent estate so Ennis can reveal his information face-to-face. Sebastian has assisted Drake before and, long ago, had a liaison with Lady Ennis. Drake insists Sebastian is just the man to be Drake&#x2019;s surrogate at the house party&#x2014;the guests will imagine all manner of possibilities and be blind to Sebastian&#x2019;s true purpose. Unsurprisingly, Sebastian is reluctant, but Drake&#x2019;s need is real. With only more debutantes on his horizon, Sebastian allows himself to be persuaded. His first task is to inveigle Antonia Rawlings, a lady he has known all her life, to include him as her escort to the house party. Although he&#x2019;s seen little of Antonia in recent years, Sebastian is confident of gaining her support. Eldest daughter of the Earl of Chillingworth, Antonia has abandoned the search for a husband and plans to use the week of the house party to decide what to do with her life. There has to be some purpose, some role, she can claim for her own. Consequently, on hearing Sebastian&#x2019;s request and an explanation of what lies behind it, she seizes on the call to action. Suppressing her senses&#x2019; idiotic reaction to Sebastian&#x2019;s nearness, she agrees to be his partner-in-intrigue. But while joining the house party proves easy, the gathering is thrown into chaos when Lord Ennis is murdered&#x2014;just before he was to speak with Sebastian. Worse, Ennis&#x2019;s last words, gasped to Sebastian, are: Gunpowder. Here. Gunpowder? And here, where? With a killer continuing to stalk the halls, side by side, Sebastian and Antonia search for answers and, all the while, the childhood connection that had always existed between them strengthens and blooms...into something so much more.

A young jazz buff in Tokyo. A crooked British lawyer in Hong Kong. A disc jockey in Manhattan. A physicist in Ireland. An elderly woman running a tea shack in rural China. A cult-controlled terrorist in Okinawa. A musician in London. A transmigrating spirit in Mongolia. What is the common thread of coincidence or destiny that connects the lives of these nine souls in nine far-flung countries, stretching across the globe from east to west? What pattern do their linked fates form through time and space?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A writer of pyrotechnic virtuosity and profound compassion, a mind to which nothing human is alien, David Mitchell spins genres, cultures, and ideas like gossamer threads around and through these nine linked stories. Many forces bind these lives, but at root all involve the same universal longing for connection and transcendence, an axis of commonality that leads in two directions--to creation and to destruction. In the end, as lives converge with a fearful symmetry, Ghostwritten comes full circle, to a point at which a familiar idea--that whether the planet is vast or small is merely a matter of perspective--strikes home with the force of a new revelation. It marks the debut of a writer of astonishing gifts.</p><p>"What is real and what is not?" David Mitchell's <i>Ghostwritten: A Novel in Nine Parts</i> plays with precisely this question throughout its elaborately compartmentalized narrative. (That there are 10 chapters in this 9-part invention is just one more aspect of the author's mysterious schema.) With its multitude of voices and globe-girdling locations--Tokyo, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Petersburg, London--this first novel offers readers a vertiginous, sometimes seductive, display of persona and place.<p> At the heart of Mitchell's book is the global extension of the postmodern city, and the networks (cultural, technological, phantasmagoric) to which it gives rise. A metropolis like Tokyo is quite literally beyond our comprehension: </p><blockquote> Twenty million people live and work in Tokyo. It's so big that nobody really knows where it stops. It's long since filled up the plain, and now it's creeping up the mountains to the west and reclaiming land from the bay in the east. The city never stops rewriting itself. In the time one street guide is produced, it's already become out of date. It's a tall city, and a deep one, as well as a spread-out one. </blockquote> At this level, urban sprawl becomes an epistemological condition. On one hand it leads to a Japanese death cult, purging the "unclean" from the city's subway with nerve gas. And on the other, it produces a certain splintering of the human personality. "I'm this person, I'm this person, I'm that person, I'm that person too," chants Neal, the narrator of the book's second part. "No wonder it's all such a ... mess." He's talking about his life as a Hong Kong trader, a "man of departments, compartments, apartments." But he might also be describing the experience of reading <i>Ghostwritten</i>. At once loquacious and knowing, leisurely and frantic, Mitchell offers a huge, but fragmentary, portmanteau. And while he's labored diligently to solder together the many parts--the aching bodies, the reality police, the impossibly complex machinery of contemporary life--his novel, too, may suffer from an excess of split personality. <i>--Vicky Lebeau</i>"Mitchell... has a gift for fiction's natural pleasures&#x2013;intricate surprises, insidiously woven narratives, ingenious voices...

Katya knows that it's up to her to rescue the prince and undo the evil spell that has banished the sun. Armed with only the magic nesting doll and her own valiant heart, she is determined to succeed.

Katya is given a magical nesting doll by her dying grandmother but is told that she can only use its magic three times. After entering a land of eternal winter, the young woman discovers a prince who has been turned into "living ice" through an enchantment. Aided in turn by a bear, wolf, and firebird that appear from inside the doll, Katya is able to restore the prince to his former self and destroy the villainous Grand Vizier. Needless to say, she and the prince live happily ever after. While the writing is filled with description and poetic images, it is the stunning full-page artwork that steals the show. Created using oil paints on paper primed with gesso, the illustrations are alive with detail and reminiscent of the miniaturist style used in Russian decorative items such as lacquered boxes, pins, and some nesting dolls. The palette reinforces the plot with black, blue, and purple gradually giving way to red, gold, and white. The page layout and design are also outstanding. This accessible, gorgeous title will undoubtedly pique children's interest in Russian folklore and nesting dolls.

She passed away in 2002.PreSchool-Grade 3-This tale drawn from Jewish folklore has been told in many variations, but never so richly. It is a story of relationships, trust, transformations, and optimism, as well as being an entree to Jewish history in Eastern Europe of the 19th-20th century. Grandpa trims away the worn parts of Joseph's baby blanket and uses it to make him a jacket in the first of its many transformations into ever smaller items: a vest, a tie, a handkerchief, and a button as each item in turn becomes worn. When the button is lost, Joseph declares: "'There is just enough material here to make...a wonderful story!'" The story is told with repetitive, rhythmic phrases that children will soon anticipate and join in on. Using colored pencils, watercolors, and possibly other media, Gilman has created a shtetl in a book. Each oversized wood-framed page draws readers closely into the town or into Joseph's house and also below its floor where the mice use each discarded scrap to furnish their own snug home. Shades of warm brown, rust, and gold, accented with bright blue, lend a feeling of nostalgia. Gilman's art is subtle with painterly shading, a skillful use of light and dark, and expressive line. Each page is beautifully composed. While some of the folk characters' expressions are exaggerated, this is, after all, supposed to be funny.<br><i> Marcia Posner, Federation of New York and the Jewish Book Council, New York City</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Ultimate Soup Bible: Over 400 Recipes for Delicious Soups from Around the World with Step-by-step Instructions for Every Recipe</h2><p><p>This lavishly illustrated volume is the ultimate guide to soup-making, with mouthwatering recipes from around the world.

Not so! Author Suzy Cohen believes that you can treat diabetes through safe, natural means, like food and vitamins, rather than strictly relying on prescription drugs. And she shifts the focus away from strict glucose management to a whole body approach, using supplements, minerals, and dietary changes, to lose weight, repair cell damage, improve insulin function, and reduce the side effects from prescription drugs, many of which rob nutrients from the body. This 5-step program uses natural alternatives-all backed by scientific studies-to help you restore your body&#39;s own supply of insulin, the key to keeping blood sugar levels under control. In this breakthrough program, you&#39;ll follow these steps: ?Step 1: Drink nutrition-packed green drinks ?Step 2: Add vitamin D supplem</p><p><b>Suzy Cohen, RPh</b>, has been a licensed pharmacist for more than 20 years and writes the syndicated health column "Dear Pharmacist."

Surprised? Well, consider the possibility that you've never been given the whole truth about the ingredients in the foods that you love. You've not been told just how bad they are, or how they contribute to disease.<br><br>Relax! This isn't going to be a lecture on what you should or should not eat. This is just a story. Let's go on a journey together . . .<br><br>Once upon a time, a crop of wheat spent months growing in a serene field in Kansas. The farmer had taken special care before planting the seeds to make sure the soil was tilled and properly fertilized. He sprayed the field with various pesticides, fungicides, and other chemicals to protect the harvest. And there we have our first problem. It shocks me, but 83 of the active ingredients in pesticides are still in use even though studies have shown that they can cause cancer in animals or humans.<br><br>After the Kansas farmer's wheat matured and turned a beautiful golden color, he harvested the grain and placed it in a grain elevator until he was ready to sell it. Any time wheat is placed in storage, workers need to keep an eye on it, making sure it stays cool and dry, because rainy, warm weather promotes the growth of fungus. Of particular concern is Fusarium graminearum, a fungus that can infect both animals and people. It can cause vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, staggering, skin irritation, and immune system suppression.<br><br>Wheat kernels are typically ground into various types of flour. In my story, the Kansas farmer's wheat is destined to be turned into "all-purpose flour" because demand for this flour is high. And here we have the second problem (actually the third if you count the possibility of fungal contamination).<br><br>To make all-purpose flour, wheat kernels must be stripped of their bran and germ layers. This stripping process removes the most nutritious parts of the grain, such as the fiber, minerals, and vitamins. Oddly enough, this flour will probably command a higher price than natural whole wheat flour because it will go through more processing.<br><br>The insanity doesn't stop there, though. The flour--which is naturally brown--still needs to be whitened using a chemical that is standard in the flour industry, chlorine gas. The Environmental Protection Agency categorizes chlorine gas as a pesticide and defines it as a flour- bleaching, aging, and oxidizing agent that is a powerful irritant, dangerous to inhale, and lethal. Chlorine gas, when it comes in contact with wheat, also forms another substance called alloxan, which is known to destroy pancreatic function. Did you catch that?<br><br>ALLOXAN TOXIN: IT'S IN YOUR BREAD<br><br>Alloxan is so good at destroying the pancreas that scientists even use it in clinical trials to induce diabetes in lab animals! It is a well- documented fact that bleached white flour is contaminated with alloxan. Who would do such a thing? Someone (and that someone is probably a megacorporation) who makes a living from turning wheat into flour, that's who.<br><br>Let's take a closer look at this toxin. As mentioned above, when flour is processed in modern mills to make white flour, it undergoes a chlorine gas bath (chlorine dioxide). Other chemicals are used, too, including benzoyl peroxide, which people apply externally to zap their zits.<br><br>Anyway, chlorine gas reacts with some proteins in the flour and produces alloxan as a by-product. Alloxan is anything but pure, and it's never disclosed on labels of products that use bleached white flour. In animals, alloxan destroys beta cells, the specialized group of cells in the pancreas that make insulin. And insulin, as you know, reduces your blood sugar levels.<br><br>So in short, the more alloxan consumed, the more likely the development of diabetes, at least in lab animals. This isn't a secret. Scientists routinely use alloxan to destroy the pancreas of lab animals, usually rodents.<br><br>Alloxan looks similar to glucose, so it's readily taken up by beta cells, where it sparks tremendous free-radical damage and kills the cells so they no longer produce insulin. When enough beta cells die, insulin production stops.<br><br>Researchers inject the healthy animals with alloxan to induce diabetes. When the animal is sick, they test certain drugs to determine drug efficacy. Does this mean that alloxan can similarly destroy the beta cells in the human pancreas, thereby closing down insulin production and causing diabetes? Do you want to find out by exposing your own pancreas to this deadly substance?<br><br>Alloxan is in almost all commercial baked goodies made with white flour. Is it just me, or do you feel like a guinea pig, too?<br><br>The U.S. milling industry produces about 140 million �ds of flour each day, and the use of chlorides for bleaching flour is considered an industry standard. Alloxan is a by-product of the bleaching process. Since food manufacturers aren't actually adding alloxan to the flour, it's not going to appear on ingredient labels. But usually between 5 and 15 grams per 100 grams of flour could be contaminated. This means that the next soft white bun you reach for is not only void of nutrition but also contains potential poisons.<br><br>If you eat anything made with white flour, you are probably eating alloxan regularly. Believe me, the average American eats far more �ds of baked goodies per year than fruits and vegetables (which weigh more).<br><br>And with that much consumption, I'm guessing you may be one of the people who eats a lot of alloxan without even knowing it. Shocked? I hope so, because I want you to remain motivated to avoid foods that spike your blood sugar and potentially damage your pancreas.<br><br>The Textbook of Natural Medicine calls alloxan a "potent beta-cell toxin." It's a shame that the FDA sanctions the use of this chemical in products that people eat every day. I honestly don't think you have a death wish, because you are reading my book trying to get well and are clearly willing to make changes. I'm so proud of you for taking this step.<br><br>It's a wonder to me that white bread and other products made with white flour can put a person at risk for diabetes and all of its complications, such as diabetic coma, amputation, blindness, kidney failure, nerve pain, and eventual death. A man named Jack used to come to the pharmacy where I worked in the late 1990s, and he had diabetes. I told him to give up white flour goods and gluten-containing foods. He didn't want to. I saw him last year--unfortunately, he had given up his right leg instead. As a complication of diabetes, that leg had to be amputated. I'll never know for sure if my suggestion would have helped him, but I think it could have. I'm going to teach you in subsequent chapters how to cook with flours that are not contaminated with toxins such as alloxan.<br><br>Turning naturally dark, nutrition-packed wheat into white, nutritionally empty flour happens as a result of the strong demand from consumers to eat muffins, pastries, breads, and biscuits that are white, not brown. I have always been puzzled at the name "all-purpose flour" because to me, it doesn't even serve the primary purpose of food, which is to provide nutritional value, so I think it should be renamed "no-purpose flour."<br><br>Many people buy wheat germ to add to their baking recipes or to supplement their diet. If you buy wheat germ, guess what you're doing? You're paying a lot of money to buy the nutrients that were stripped in the process of making all-purpose flour. You have to realize that wheat germ is where most of the essential nutrients in wheat are concentrated, including vitamin E, folate (folic acid), phosphorus, thiamin, zinc, magnesium, essential fatty acids, and fiber.<br><br>VITAMIN E PROTECTS YOU<br><br>The toxin alloxan, which is found in most white flour, can damage the pancreas. But even if you've been eating white flour goodies for decades, there are still things you can do to help minimize the problem. First of all, stop eating white flour from this day forward. Whole grain flour is better (so long as you are not gluten intolerant), and almond flour, rice flour, or quinoa flour are even better alternatives. Those are the ones I use in my house.<br><br>If you've been eating a lot of white bread, buns, and biscuits all your life, there's something you can take to help reverse the damage--vitamin E. In animal studies, this potent antioxidant protected lab rats from alloxan damage.<br><br>I know we're not rats, but we are mammals (just like rats), and I think taking a powerful antioxidant, such as natural vitamin E, could be beneficial for you, especially if you have consumed a diet high in white flour products or you have a history of diabetes in your family. Try taking 400 IU of mixed natural vitamin E tocopherols daily.<br><br>HOW SWEET IT ISN'T<br><br>Now let's return to the story I was telling you before I went into my rant about white flour. Let's turn our attention to another farmer. This farmer lives in Florida and grows sugar cane in his semitropical fields. His sugar cane will eventually be pressed to produce molasses, a healthy sweetener. There are three grades of molasses: mild or first molasses, dark or second molasses, and the most intense, dark form, blackstrap molasses. And as you guessed, I'm all for your choosing blackstrap molasses, as it contains energy-producing iron, bone-building calcium, and a wealth of other healthy minerals.<br><br>Now here comes the real head-scratcher. Most of the molasses that comes from sugar cane does not end up on grocery store shelves as molasses. Instead, molasses is stripped of its life-giving vitamins, minerals, and fiber as it is processed into white sugar crystals, the kind you find in big bags at the supermarket.<br><br>So most sugar cane--which can produce nutrition-rich molasses--instead becomes nothing more than an alien substance that is never found in nature. Hey, but it tastes good, right?!<br><br>Nutritionally naked sugar crystals are very sweet. They are also bleached because Americans think white sugar is pretty. (I know; it doesn't make sense to me either.)<br><br>RECIPE FOR DIABETES<br><br>Now let's conduct an experiment. We'll combine the white all-purpose flour with white sugar and add some white table salt. Add a pinch of baking powder, a little baking soda, and some yeast (which is a form of fungus). Now add some liquid, such as cow's milk, which may be linked to diabetes, but more about that in Chapter 4.<br><br>Heat this goopy substance to about 350�F. It will rise and expand. When it cools off, we'll deep-fry it in refined vegetable oil loaded with trans fats that don't readily dissolve in your bloodstream and therefore cut off blood flow to your heart. Now let's cool off the deadly time bomb. And to make it attractive we'll paint it pink with a sticky mixture made from red food coloring, white sugar, and some more greasy trans fats. This is a good time to tell you that the red food colorant comes from boiling and crushing cochineals, insects also known as beetle bugs. Ewww!<br><br>Does what we made sound appetizing to you?<br><br>Would you eat it or serve it to your kids?<br><br>Could I get you to eat it for a hundred dollars?<br><br>How about if I serve it with coffee and call it a doughnut?<br><br>A PILL FOR EVERY ILL<br><br>That story may have been hard to swallow, but if you eat bagels, muffins, hamburger buns, or any other product made from white flour, the story line remains pretty much the same. The American diet is laden with dangerous chemicals that promote diabetes. Even people who think that they eat healthy have kitchens full of canned, boxed, or processed foods.<br><br>People think wheat flour is good for them when they see it on the label, but wheat flour it just another way to say white flour. Think of it this way. When a recipe reads "add 1 cup of flour," don't you just automatically pour into your measuring cup regular all-purpose white flour that you buy from the grocery store in those big bags? It probably doesn't dawn on you to use any other kind.<br><br>That's what wheat flour is, and though you may think it's healthy, it's really not. As you saw in our story, it has been heavily refined and then bleached white. This type of junk flour looks nothing like the beautiful, nutrient-dense grain it was made from.<br><br>We are trained to think that flour comes one way, and we follow our taste buds like zombies in the dark. I promise that in the chapters to follow you will learn all about eating healthy, nutritious, tasty foods without compromising your health.<br><br>Now do you believe me when I tell you that you are not given the whole truth about the foods you eat? Twenty-five years of nutritional advice from brain-dead health officials has only made us fatter and sicker.<br><br>Our life expectancy at birth in America is now estimated to be around 77.9 years. In 1995 it was 75.8, and in 1955, it was 69.6 years, according to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics. So far, it all sounds pretty good, right? But the report also contains the fact that in 40 other countries, life expectancy is higher than it is the United States. By the way, the top place goes to Andorra, a tiny country in the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain, whose citizens' life expectancy is estimated to be 83.5 years. Japan is number two. Macau, San Marino, and Singapore rank third, fourth, and fifth.<br><br>We have been seriously duped. Ah, but no worries, doctors can prescribe lots of pills to bring your blood sugar level down. And more drugs to lower your cholesterol, some to reduce your blood pressure, and, of course, for all that belching and indigestion, there are acid blockers. You may need insulin shots by now, too. It's the American way, a pill for every ill.<br><br>When the medications stop working for you--and eventually they will--you might wind up with a bad infection, so bad that antibiotics fail to help you. Then doctors might need to cut off your limbs, one at a time. You'll have to take more drugs for the excruciating pain, depression, and insomnia. You might wind up in a nursing home because family members cannot care for you any longer.<br><br>Gosh, sorry. This story is suddenly taking a dark turn. This doesn't have to be your fate, however--not if you carefully follow the dietary and lifestyle advice presented in this book. But unfortunately this will be the horrific fate for many, since 24 million people in the United States struggle with diabetes and an estimated 221 million battle the disease worldwide. Back in 2000, the World Health Organization proclaimed there was a "global epidemic of obesity," and the numbers of people with diabetes have been climbing ever since. It doesn't have to be that way.

Perhaps Roxanne.<br><br>Now she took the "h" out of Johnston and added a second "y" to Jayne.<br><br>Jayyne Jonstone. It looked like the name you would have if you designed sequined gowns for a living, or pointed to prizes on television quiz shows.<br><br>"Earth to Janie," said Mr. Brylowe.<br><br>She blushed, wondering how many times he had called her.<br><br>"The rest of us are reading our essays aloud, Janie,' said Mr. Brylowe. "We'd like to issue an invitation for you to join us."<br><br>She blushed so hotly she had to put her hands over her cheeks.<br><br>"Don't do that," said Pete. "You're cute when your face matches your hair."<br><br>Immediately, the back row of boys went into barbershop singing, hands on hearts, invisible straw hats flung into the air. "Once in love with Janie," they sang.<br><br>Janie had never had a boyfriend. She was always asked to dances, was always with a crowd--but no boy had actually said <i>I want to be with you and you alone.</i><br><br>Mr. Brylowe told Janie to read her essay aloud.<br><br>The blush faded. She felt white and sick. She hated standing up in class. Hated hearing her voice all alone in the quiet of the room.<br><br>The bell rang.<br><br>English was a split period: they had lunch in the middle and came back for more class. Never had lunch come at such an appropriate moment. Perhaps she would write a better essay during the twenty-seven minutes of lunch.<br><br>Certainly it wasn't going to take Janie long to eat. They had recently discovered she had a lactose intolerance. This was a splashy way of saying she had stomachaches when she drank milk. "No more ice cream, no more milk" was the medical/parental decree.<br><br>However, peanut butter sandwiches (which she had in her bag lunch) required milk. I am so sick of fruit juice, Janie thought. I want milk.<br><br>She had been eating since the school year began with Pete, Adair, Sarah-Charlotte, Jason, and Katrina.<br><br>She loved all their names.<br><br>Her last-year's daydream--before a driver's license absorbed all daydream time--had been about her own future family. She couldn't picture her husband-to-be, but she could see her children perfectly: two beautiful little girls, and she would name them Denim and Lace. She used to think about Denim and Lace all the time. Shopping at the mall with Sarah-Charlotte, shed go into all the shoe stores to play with the little teeny sneakers for newborns, and think of all the pretty clothes she'd buy one day for Denim and Lace.<br><br>Now she knew those names were nauseating, and if she did name her daughters Denim and Lace, there'd probably be a divorce, and her husband would get custody on the grounds anybody who chose those names was unfit. She'd have to name them something sensible, like Emily and Margaret.<br><br>Peter, Adair, Sarah-Charlotte, Jason, Katrina, and Janie went in a mob down the wide stairs, through the wide halls, and into the far-too-small cafeteria. The kids complained about the architecture of the school (all that space dedicated to passing periods and hardly any to lunch), but they loved being crammed in, filching each other's potato chips, telling secrets they wanted everybody to overhear, passing notes to be snatched up by the boy you hoped would snatch them, and sending the people on the outside of the crush to get you a second milk.<br><br>Everybody but Janie Johnson got milk: cardboard cartons so small you needed at least three, but the lunch ladies would never let you. Janie was envious. Those luckies are swigging down nice thick white milk, she thought, and I'm stuck with cranberry juice.<br><br>"Okay," said Sarah-Charlotte. Sarah-Charlotte would not bother with you if you tried to abbreviate her name. Last year she had reached a standoff with a teacher who insisted on calling her Sarah. Sarah-Charlotte glared at him silently for months until he began calling her Miss Sherwood, which let them both win. "Okay, who's been kidnapped this time?" said Sarah-Charlotte wearily, as if jaded with the vast number of kidnappings in the world. Sarah-Charlotte patted her white-blond hair, which was as neat as if she had cut it out of a magazine and pasted it onto her head. Janie, whose mass of hair was never the same two minutes in a row, and whose face could be difficult to find beneath the red tangles, never figured out how Sarah-Charlotte kept her hair so neat. "I have approximately five hundred thousand fewer hairs than you do," Sarah-Charlotte explained once.<br><br>Everybody turned the milk cartons over to see who had been kidnapped. The local dairy put pictures of stolen children on the back of the carton. Every few weeks there was a new child.<br><br>"I don't know how you're supposed to recognize somebody who was three years old when she got taken from a shopping center in New Jersey, and that was nearly a dozen years ago," said Adair. "It's ridiculous." Adair was as sleek and smooth as her name; even her dark hair matched: unruffled and gleaming like a seal out of water.<br><br>Janie sipped juice from a cardboard packet and pretended it was milk. Across the cafeteria Reeve waved. Reeve lived next door. He was a senior. Reeve never did homework. It was his life ambition to get in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records,</i> and the only thing he had a stab at was the "Never Did His Homework Once but Still Got the Occasional B Plus" listing.<br><br>Reeve had gotten the occasional B plus, but he had also gotten a lot of D's and F's. News came from the Academic Office that unless Reeve shaped up, he would not graduate with his class.<br><br>His two older sisters and one older brother had gone to spectacular colleges--Cornell, Princeton, and Stanford. They were mortified by Reeve's failures and came home weekends to tell him so.<br><br>Reeve had ceased to speak to his entire family. In fact, he stomped away and had supper at Janie's so often that Janie's mother had said last night, "I'm thinking of charging your parents a meal fee."<br><br>Reeve did not laugh. In a strangled voice he said, "I'm sorry. I won't come again."<br><br>Janie's father punched him, the way, if it had been Janie, he would have hugged. Jabbing Reeve in the gut, her father said, "Meals here, bed there, Reeve. Someday we'll collect our debt."<br><br>"Yeah, when I'm a plumber," said Reeve gloomily, "you'll let me clean your drains."<br><br>"Now, Reeve. Just start studying, pull those grades up, and--" Her father broke off. "Right," he said, punching Reeve again. "In this house we won't discuss it. Here. Have a brownie and some ice cream."<br>It was such a trespass on Reeve, that everybody knew the details. Whatever Reeve kept secret, his mother told Janie's mother anyway. Reeve felt cramped by the intimacy of his life: he had always lived in this town, always gone to this school. I want to live in a city, he'd said last night, and be anonymous.<br><br>Ruefully Janie thought her name would give her a pretty good start if she wanted to go anonymous.<br><br>Sarah-Charlotte was hoping Reeve would ask Janie out. Sarah-Charlotte was not interested in getting her driver's license; she was interested in having a steady boyfriend, who had to be tall, handsome, muscular, smart, courteous, and rich. Reeve was all but one.<br><br>"And if Reeve doesn't ask you out," was Sarah-Charlotte's theory, &amp;...</p><h2>The Norton Anthology of Short Fiction, Shorter 7th Edition</h2><p><p><strong>The classroom standard for readers and aspiring writers of fiction, <em>The Norton Anthology of Short Fiction</em> offers the most comprehensive, engaging selection of classic and contemporary stories in the field.</strong></p></p><p><p><strong>Richard Bausch</strong> is the author of twelve novels, including <em>In the Night Season</em>, <em>Hello to the Cannibals</em>, and <em>Before, During, After</em>.

Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded.<br><br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual.<br><br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God.<br><br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d;<br><br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess.<br><br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus.<br><br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman?<br><br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case!<br><br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>In All Its Fury: A History of the Blizzard of January 12, 1888</h2><p>The morning of January 12, 1888, walm and warm.

Set in the year 632 After Ford, Huxley's world is one where human beings are scientifically mass-produced, classified (as Alphas, Betas, Gammas), and "decanted" in laboratory factories. Father and Mother are forbidden words; pleasure comes in euphoria-producing tablets; efficiency is the rule. With no place for emotions, God, or art, it is a horrifying, but often humorous, glimpse into a future perhaps not far from fact.<br><br>In BRAVE NEW WORLD REVISITED, Huxley's equally famous essay, the author links the realities of the modern world to his fictional vision--demonstrating with unflinching logic the closeness of reality to his automated nightmare. Scrutinizing numerous methods for curtailing individual freedoms and the sometimes irresistible pressures to adopt them, the book is a fervent plea for humankind to educate itself for liberty before it is too late.<br><br>Both written with Huxley's customary artistic skill and intellectual vigor, BRAVE NEW WORLD and BRAVE NEW WORLD REVISITED provide incisive and challenging views of the modern world that are still relevant today.</p><p></p><h2>The Annotated Arch: A Crash Course in the History Of Architecture (Volume 2)</h2><p><i>The Annotated Arch</i> takes architectural history out of the realm of dreary textbooks into a world of dynamic design, succinct page-length essays and instructive sidebars.&nbsp;These graphic devices heighten the reader's ability to retain an impressive amount of information, even through a cursory reading.<br><br>Incorporating more than 250 illustrations, <i>The Annotated Arch</i> draws on the very elements of architecture to craft a visual and textual approach to the subject that no ordinary textbook could match.

Originally published in 1968, Listen to the Lambs grew from a letter Otis wrote to an expatriate friend during the days following the riots. Otis moves back and forth between Watts and his own childhood to reveal an alternative history of the riots. Equal parts memoir, social history, and racial manifesto, Listen to the Lambs is a moving witness of collective turmoil and a people for whom the long-promised American Dream was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, Johnny Otis is a celebrated American blues and R &amp; B musician.

Perhaps because this novel developed from a screenplay, the audio production enhances the story. Dialogue, which seems hokey when read in the book, is more natural and believable when heard here. Gaines&#39;s narration is slow and dusty for Floyd, but appropriately twanging, drawling or dripping with honey for other characters. The story moves quickly and is an engaging tale well told. J.L.

Saddam&#x2019;s murderous regime had collapsed; the shooting and bombing had stopped; and people could go anywhere they pleased and say anything they wanted. In Baghdad, the American forces were greeted with smiles, waves and shouts of joy. On the eastern bank of the Euphrates near the French embassy, wealthy Sunni suburbanites&#x2014;anxious to win favor&#x2014;led American Marines to the estates of Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and high-level generals. When the giant Stalinesque statue of Saddam, arm raised and mustache bristling, fell in Firdos Square, Americans and Iraqis alike were pulling on the ropes. April 2003 was an interlude of good cheer, reminiscent of the liberation of Paris in 1944&#x2014;a moment in time when people forgot their wants and their fears and flocked to the streets to cheer the soldiers.<br><br> In Fallujah, though, the residents did not cheer when paratroopers from the 82d Airborne Division drove into the city in late April. In Baghdad, looters as numerous as locusts had stripped every government building, even carting away bricks. In Fallujah, the windows and electric fixtures at the Baath headquarters at the Government Center remained intact. Most looting was confined to the industrial sector, and only the poor people who lived south of Highway 10 greeted the Americans with smiles. Across the Euphrates south of the city, the large estates of prominent Baathists and army officers stood empty but untouched, securely guarded by the curlicue Baathist symbol on the courtyard gates. Saddam&#x2019;s apparatchiks did not consider themselves defeated. They were in temporary hiding and Fallujah was still their bastion, untouched by the war and unbowed by the presence of a few hundred American soldiers.<br><br> At dusk on April 28, 2003&#x2014;Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s birthday&#x2014;a raucous mob of about a hundred men, women, and children pushed their way into the courtyard of the mayor&#x2019;s office, where the 82nd had set up headquarters. The paratroopers had no warning that an anti-American demonstration was planned and had no idea what the Iraqis were protesting or why. The mob accused the surprised American soldiers of spying on women with night-seeing binoculars and of showing pornography to children. Using translators and loudspeakers, a group of paratroopers warned away the mob. The crowd walked several blocks to another neighborhood, where they harassed another detachment of paratroopers. Several men in the crowd were firing AK-47s into the air, which the veteran paratroopers interpreted not as a threat but as bravado. They told them to move on.<br><br> The mob then walked to a schoolhouse to harass another platoon of paratroopers, who were sleeping inside. It was well after nine and dark. The crowd had a new demand: the soldiers had to leave immediately so that the children could go to school the next day. As the mob pressed up to the schoolyard wall, three Iraqis on a nearby roof started shooting their rifles.<br><br> Inside the schoolhouse a squad leader, convinced he was under fire, radioed his company commander for permission to return fire. At the same time another sergeant radioed the same request. Believing his men were under attack, the company commander gave the order, and the keyed-up paratroopers unleashed a fusillade of automatic weapons fire. In the next several minutes fifteen men, women, and children were killed and dozens were wounded. None of the paratroopers were injured.<br><br> The next day seven major Western news outlets sent reporters from Baghdad to cover the story. Most filed similar stories about a terrible tragedy caused by a sudden flare-up in the dark. Several Iraqis had fired weapons, they reported, but while the Iraqis said they had been shooting in the air, the American soldiers said they had been the targets. The reporters wrote that they did see graffiti written in English on the walls of the school where the soldiers were sleeping, disparaging the Iraqis with slogans like &#x201c;I love pork&#x201d; and a drawing of a camel with the words Iraqi Cab Company below it.<br><br> The press focused on the human cost of the incident, the clash of cultures, and the bitterness the casualties had caused throughout the city. The shootings, according to the news accounts, would unleash a cycle of retribution: more deaths and more revenge attacks. But they gave no explanation as to why or how Fallujans had mounted an anti-American protest on Saddam&#x2019;s birthday, just days after the regime had collapsed, at a time when most Iraqis were celebrating.<br><br> Six months later Jamil Karaba, a Fallujah resident, was arrested after he was overheard bragging about organizing the mob and planting gunmen among the protesters.<br><br> Called the &#x201c;destruction-maker,&#x201d; Karaba was an alcoholic former Baathist with several prior arrests and with ties to the gangster element in town. Provoking an incident was a centuries-old guerrilla stratagem for turning the people against the soldiery. And this time, as so often in the past, it had worked.<br><br> The next day a screaming mob carried on its shoulders the mufti Sheikh Jamal&#x2014;the senior imam who interpreted Islamic laws&#x2014;to the mayor&#x2019;s office.<br><br> &#x201c;All Americans leave Iraq!&#x201d; he shouted, as the crowd roared in agreement.<br> Cities acquire caricature, if not character. New York is frenetic and brash; San Francisco is liberal and laid-back; Los Angeles is imbued with glitter and celebrity. Ask Iraqis about Fallujah, and they roll their eyes: Fallujah is strange, sullen, wild-eyed, badass, just plain mean. Fallujans don&#x2019;t like strangers, which includes anyone not homebred. Wear lipstick or Western-style long hair, sip a beer or listen to an American CD, and you risk the whip or a beating.<br><br> For centuries the city had traded with&#x2014;and stolen from&#x2014;merchants who were headed east to Baghdad. The frontier town bordering an open desert attracted outcasts and criminals. In the early twentieth century European travelers learned not to tarry in Fallujah. After Iraq won its independence in 1959, Fallujah became a source of enforcers for the ruling Sunni-dominated Baath Party. The city&#x2019;s tough reputation continued under Saddam.<br><br> Laid out in a square grid of wide boulevards, Fallujah comprised two thousand blocks of courtyard walls, tenements, two-story concrete houses, and squalid alleyways. Half-completed houses, garbage heaps, and wrecks of old cars cluttered every neighborhood. The six lanes of Highway 10 ran straight through the center of the two-mile-long city, from a traffic cloverleaf on the eastern end to the Brooklyn Bridge, over the Euphrates, to the west. South of Highway 10 sprawled the decaying buildings and waste pits of a decrepit industrial zone. On an aerial map the layout of straight streets and dense blocks of houses faintly resembled Manhattan, giving rise to nicknames. Next to the industrial zone was Queens, a poor section of shabby three- and four-room houses. North of Highway 10 were the spacious houses of East Manhattan and Midtown, with its established mosques. The Government Center was in Midtown, while the old souk and marketplace, called the Jolan, were next to the Euphrates to the west. Along the main street were the billboards, restaurants, repair shops, and other struggling efforts of a merchant class. It was a city of monochrome color, without architectural flair.<br><br> With forty-seven mosques in its neighborhoods and fifty more in the neighboring villages, Fallujah was called &#x201c;the city of a hundred mosques.&#x201d; For decades the city had been the repository of the extreme Wahhabi, or Salafi, traditions flowing in from Saudi Arabia. Saddam, distrusting Fallujans&#x2019; fundamentalism, had restricted their movements and used them as his cat&#x2019;s paw.<br><br> Although 60 percent of Iraqis were Shiites, the 20 percent who were Sunnis had held the political power for centuries. When Saddam&#x2019;s army was defeated and thrown out of Kuwait in 1991, the Shiites in southern Iraq, encouraged by ill-conceived American exhortations, had revolted. To crush them, Saddam incited sectarian hatred. The Shiites, he warned the Sunnis, were blasphemers who had to be killed to preserve the true Muslim religion. Imams in Fallujah and other Sunni cities led the faithful in the chant: &#x201c;Our blood and souls to redeem you, O Islam.&#x201d; Saddam&#x2019;s army, led by Sunni officers, crushed the Shiite uprising.<br><br> Just before the Americans drove into Fallujah in April 2003, the mufti Jamal, the senior Sunni cleric in the city, warned the residents that the American invaders would turn Iraq over to the Shiites. The radical clerics were calling President Bush &#x201c;Hulagu II,&#x201d; a reference to the conquest of ancient Baghdad by the Mongol leader Hulagu, assisted by a Shiite leader who betrayed the ruling caliph. The Americans, the mufti told the citizens, were modern-day Mongols&#x2014;infidel invaders and occupiers.<br> Fallujah&#x2019;s pro-Coalition mayor, Taha Bedawi, could not stand up against the anger that the shooting had provoked. He asked the paratroopers to leave the city, explaining that revenge attacks were inevitable. Maintaining peace between tribes depended upon exchanging an eye for an eye, one life for another. If an insult went unavenged, the family and tribe suffered humiliation and were seen as weak, thus encouraging further attacks. While the mayor was talking, a group of men gathered outside under banners that read &#x201c;US killers we&#x2019;ll kick you out.&#x201d;<br><br> The 82nd Airborne units withdrew on schedule in early May and were replaced by a company from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. In the following weeks, although the American soldiers kept a low profile, repeated firefights erupted.

Though twelve-year-old Li Jing&#39;s name is a different character entirely from the Huli Jing, the sound is close enough to provide constant teasing-but maybe is also a source of greater destiny and power. Jing&#39;s life isn&#39;t easy. Her father is a poor tea farmer, and her family has come to the conclusion that in order for everyone to survive, Jing must be sacrificed for the common good. She is sold as a bride to the Koh family, where she will be the wife and nursemaid to their three-year-old son, Ju&#39;nan. It&#39;s not fair, and Jing feels this bitterly, especially when she is treated poorly by the Koh&#39;s, and sold yet again into a worse situation that leads Jing to believe her only option is to run away, and find home again. With the help of a spider who weaves Jing a means to escape, and a nightingale who helps her find her way, Jing embarks on a quest back to Huanan--and to herself.</p><p>Of Chinese descent, author Celeste Lim was born and raised in Malaysia, where she spent the first seventeen years of her life envious of the children she read about in English storybooks. Now, she has the desire to give the same gift&#x2014;the awareness of exciting worlds that exist beyond where we live&#x2014;to children through her own writing. A graduate of the MFA in Writing for Children program at The New School, Celeste lives in Queens with her Pomeranian, Hamlet. <i>The Crystal Ribbon</i> is her first novel.Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;When 11-year-old Jing is sold by her family to be a future bride for a wealthy three-year-old, she is thrust into a life of humiliation and punishment by her new in-laws. When her plans to flee are thwarted, her in-laws sell her to be trained as a concubine. Jing learns that the concubines-in-training receive lessons in art and politics, and their physical duties are hinted at by one of China's most celebrated concubines, who eventually assists the girl in escaping. Upon leaving the concubine house, Jing stumbles upon a young boy and encounters a village that is seemingly being slowly poisoned by a tree. Jing's triumphant rescue of the poisoned village and her hopeful future are joyous conclusions to this somber story. Her constant deprivation and painful punishments are chillingly detailed. The relationship between Jing and Jun'an, her toddler-aged future husband, is one of the few reliefs Jing has from constant harassment and harsh words, although Jun'an is rather verbally advanced for a three-year-old. Chinese words, as well as Jing's internal thoughts, are italicized, with definitions of Chinese words woven into the narrative. An author's note gives further background on the time period and traditions of 1100 CE China. Magical elements throughout bring much-needed wonder and hope to Jing's life. Although this title is set in ancient China, the theme of children being sacrificed for profit and sold into slavery or prostitution remains relevant. VERDICT An unusual and fascinating though dark tale. Purchase where novels set in ancient China are popular.&#x2014;Jennifer Schultz, Fauquier County Public Library, Warrenton, VA</p><h2>Learning Legal Reasoning: Briefing, Analysis and Theory (Delaney Series Book 1)</h2><p>This widely used book in many printings begins with answers to forty commonly asked questions of first-year law students. It specifies a six-step approach to briefing a case with specific guidelines for accomplishing each step. The process of briefing cases is then demonstrated with excellent and poor briefs of increasing complexity. Emphasis is placed initially on the techniques of briefing as an introduction to the learning of legal reasoning, the first priority of the first year of law school. In addition, the book also demonstrates the relevance of more advanced modes of legal reasoning, including positivist, pragmatic, policy oriented, natural-law and other perspectives applied in decoding and understanding cases. In its introduction of jurisprudential perspectives, Learning Legal Reasoning transcends the typical technical/positivist orientation of most first-year materials.</p><p>I recommend that you first read Learning Legal Reasoning and study it well, then go on to How To Do Your Best on Law School Exams book. Avoid the too-frequent first-year blunder of waiting to prepare for exams until the final week or two of the semester. That&#39;s for college, not for law school. Begin right away, from the beginning of law school, by adding an exam &#34;lens&#34; to everything you do. The Exam book shows you, step-by-step, how to do this. Always keep in mind that the skills that got you to law school are not the skills you need to excel on law school exams. My third book, Learning Criminal Law as Advocacy Argument, incorporates common themes embodied in Learning Legal Reasoning and How to Do Your Best on Law School Exams. In each criminal law topic, it presents in building-block form the limited repertoire of core issues and related arguments so that you can concentrate your study on learning and practicing those that your professor has stressed in class, in her materials, and on her old exams.In addition, the Inside the Book section of this page includes the Detailed Table of Contents and parts of Chapter One of Learning Legal Reasoning.A law professor for thirty years, John Delaney taught criminal law, advanced criminal law, comparative criminal law, international criminal law, and other courses to law school students and students in masters and doctoral degree programs at the New York University School of Law. He then taught criminal law, advanced criminal law, the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, Jurisprudence and other courses at the City University of New York Law School. Learning Legal Reasoning, How To Do Your Best On Law School Exams and Learning Criminal Law as Advocacy Argument emerged from these decades of teaching and reflecting on what students most need to succeed and what is lacking in law school pedagogy. <p>Professor Delaney is also the author of law review articles and the general editor of nine other books, mostly about comparative law, in the American Series of Foreign Penal Codes. Prior to teaching, Professor Delaney conducted approximately one thousand trials and he wrote and argued more than one hundred and fifty appeals. Unlike many professors and others, John blends early intensive trial and appellate practice with thirty years of law school teaching, including writing hundreds of exams and grading thousands. His books are informed by this extensive practice, teaching and grading. </p><p>Now retired, John continues his teaching through his books and in continuing e-mail communication with law school students who ask him for advice, especially about exams. He is an aspiring organic gardener in the Catskill region of New York and artisnal bread baker.</p></p><h2>My Life with Martin Luther King, Jr.</h2><p>This personal, inspirational account of the history of the Civil Rights Movement describes the author's relationship with Martin Luther King, Jr., detailing their marriage, the events of the 1960s, and King's tragic assassination. Reprint. <i>SLJ. </i></p><p>Grade 7-12-- The revised edition of this 1969 autobiography contains some new information and insights, but its principal change is in the language and terminology. As in the earlier version, King describes growing up in rural Alabama, meeting her husband, their family life, and their work in the civil rights movement. Sixteen pages of black-and-white photographs illustrate the Kings' private and public life; included are photos of her and their four children participating in more recent struggles. An introduction by the children and a new preface offer advice and a broad context for contemporary readers. The book is a compelling testimony to the dedication and sacrifice of those who struggled to end racial discrimination and oppression. King's voice comes through clearly, as does her personality. At times, though, she sounds old-fashioned, particularly when she makes an appeal to today's teenagers. Her view of her husband is naturally an uncritical one, and it is but one perspective in a many-sided and often acrimonious debate. Unfortunately, she does not take into account, or even try to refute, the FBI's allegations or the points made by many of King's biographers, most notably David Garrow. While this volume is an important work by virtue of its perspective, the changes are not substantive enough to justify purchase by those already owning the earlier work. --Lyn Miller-Lachmann, Siena College Library, Loudonville, NY<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Passionate Minds: The Great Love Affair of the Enlightenment, Featuring the Scientist Emilie du Chatelet, the Poet Voltaire, Sword Fights, Book Burnings, Assorted Kings, Seditious Verse, and...</h2><p>It was 1733 when the poet and philosopher Voltaire met Emilie du Ch�telet, a beguiling&#x2014;and married&#x2014;aristocrat who would one day popularize Newton&#x2019;s arcane ideas and pave the way for Einstein&#x2019;s theories. In an era when women were rarely permitted any serious schooling, this twenty-seven-year-old&#x2019;s nimble conversation and unusual brilliance led Voltaire, then in his late thirties, to wonder, &#x201c;Why did you only reach me so late?&#x201d; They fell immediately and passionately in love.<br><br>Through the prism of their tumultuous fifteen-year relationship we see the crumbling of an ancient social order and the birth of the Enlightenment. Together the two lovers rebuilt a dilapidated and isolated rural chateau at Cirey where they conducted scientific experiments, entertained many of the leading thinkers of the burgeoning scientific revolution, and developed radical ideas about the monarchy, the nature of free will, the subordination of women, and the separation of church and state. <br><br>But their time together was filled with far more than reading and intellectual conversation. There were frantic gallopings across France, sword fights in front of besieged German fortresses, and a deadly burning of Voltaire&#x2019;s books by the public executioner at the base of the grand stairwell of the Palais de Justice in Paris. The pair survived court intrigues at Versailles, narrow escapes from agents of the king, a covert mission to the idyllic lakeside retreat of Frederick the Great of Prussia, forays to the royal gambling tables (where Emilie put her mathematical acumen to lucrative use), and intense affairs that bent but did not break their bond.<br><br>Along with its riveting portrait of Voltaire as a vulnerable romantic, Passionate Minds at last does justice to the supremely unconventional life and remarkable achievements of Emilie du Ch�telet&#x2014;including her work on the science of fire and the nature of light. Long overlooked, her story tells us much about women&#x2019;s lives at the time of the Enlightenment. Equally important, it demonstrates how this graceful, quick-witted, and attractive woman worked out the concepts that would lead directly to the &#x201c;squared&#x201d; part of Einstein&#x2019;s revolutionary equation: E=mc2.<br><br>Based on a rich array of personal letters, as well as writings from houseguests, neighbors, scientists, and even police reports, <b>Passionate Minds</b> is both panoramic and intimate in feeling. It is an unforgettable love story and a vivid rendering of the birth of modern ideas.</p><p>"Passionate Minds is both glorious and heartbreaking. For two centuries Emilie du Chatelet has been a quiet heroine, her name rarely invoked outside the science classroom. Now David Bodanis has not only brought to her life, but also uncovered one of the great love affairs of the eighteeenth century." --Amanda Foreman, author of Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire<p> </p><p>"Installs �milie in the front row of the pantheon of Enlightenment natural philosophers." --The London Times</p><p> "Fast-paced, engrossing, and enlightening, Passionate Minds is a 'can't put it down' read-- a melange of colorful, fascinating characters and ideas captured in an irresistible mix." --Barbara Goldsmith, author of Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie</p><p> "Highly entertaining...and holds the most agreeable surprises...A story well worth the retelling, and Bodanis tells it vividly." --London Sunday Times</p><p> </p><p>"Riveting, moving, often hilarious, Passionate Minds is gritty social history and hard science and romance all rolled into one. Both fast-paced and profound, Passionate Minds is an intellectual rollercoaster ride that puts the excitement back into the Enlightenment." --Emma Donoghue, author of Slammerkin</p><p> "This is an absorbing tale based on extensive research, and it takes full advantage of both heroes' propensity for coining quotable witticisms. Bodanis eloquently evokes women's restricted lives during the 18th century." --The Guardian</p><p> "Bodanis is good at explaining complex science and skillful in weaving together two unconventional, complex, and intellectually reforming lives ... David Bodanis has taken up one of the great stories of the period, a potent mix of romance, science and history...There is never a dull moment." --Telegraph</p><p></p>DAVID BODANIS taught a survey of intellectual history at the University of Oxford for many years and is the author of several books, including <b>Electric Universe</b>, <b>The Secret House</b>, and the bestselling <b>E=mc2</b>.

His writing credits span several media, including television (for episodes of&nbsp;<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i>), film, short fiction, and comic books. He resides in New York City.1 <p> </p><p> It was the hardest decision William Riker had ever made. </p><p> He cast a suspicious glare at <i>Titan's</i> unexpected visitor, a human-looking young woman with a crazy mane of sable hair and delicate garments that showed more of her body than they covered. She had claimed to be Erika Hernandez, the commanding officer of the Earth <i>Starship Columbia,</i> which had vanished more than two centuries earlier, thousands of light-years from the planet where <i>Titan</i> was now being held prisoner. Her tale seemed implausible, but she had offered to help his ship escape, and so Riker was willing to accept her extraordinary claims on faith... at least, until <i>Titan</i> was safe someplace far from here and he could put her identity to the test. </p><p> Hers had been a proposition he couldn't refuse, but freeing his ship from the reclusive aliens known as the Caeliar would come at a price: His away team -- made up of most of his senior officers, including his wife, his <i>Imzadi,</i> Deanna Troi -- would have to be abandoned on the planet's surface. </p><p> But there was a war raging at home, and above all, he had a duty to protect his ship and defend the Federation. No matter what he did, he was certain his decision would haunt him for a long time to come. </p><p> "Take us home," Riker said. </p><p> Hernandez snapped into action and took command of the situation. Pointing at the display screen over the science station, she asked curtly, "Who set up this tap on the Caeliar's subspace aperture?" </p><p> "We did," answered Commander Xin Ra-Havreii, <i>Titan's</i> chief engineer, gesturing to himself and the ship's senior science officer, Lieutenant Commander Melora Pazlar. </p><p> Hernandez stepped to the console and began entering data. The strange young woman's fingers moved with velocity and delicacy, as if she had mastered the Federation's newest technology ages earlier. "I need to change your shield specs to protect you from radiation inside the passage," she said. </p><p> "Our shields already do that," Ra-Havreii said. </p><p> "No," Hernandez replied, her flurry of tapping on the console unabated, "you only think they do. Give me a moment." Her hands came to an abrupt stop. "There." She turned and snapped at Riker's acting first officer, Commander Fo Hachesa, "Which station controls onboard systems?" </p><p> Hachesa pointed at ops. </p><p> "Thank you," she said to the stunned-silent Kobliad. Moving in rapid strides, Hernandez crossed to the forward console and nudged Lieutenant Sariel Rager out of her way. "I'm programming your deflector to create a phase-shifted soliton field. That'll make it harder for the Caeliar to shift the aperture on us while we're in transit." She looked across at Ensign Aili Lavena, the Pacifican flight-control officer. "Be ready to go at your best nonwarp speed, as soon as the passage opens. Understood?" </p><p> Lavena nodded quickly, shaking loose air bubbles inside her liquid-atmosphere breathing mask. </p><p> Watching the youthful Hernandez at work, Riker felt superfluous on his own bridge. </p><p> "All right," Hernandez announced, "I'm about to widen the subspace aperture into a full tunnel. When I do, the Caeliar will try to shut it down. Be warned: This is gonna be a rough ride." She looked around at the various alien faces on <i>Titan's</i> bridge. "Everyone ready?" The crew nodded. She met Riker's gaze. "It's your ship, Captain. Give the word." </p><p> <i>Nice of her to remember,</i> Riker thought. He led Hachesa back to their command chairs. They sat down and settled into place. Lifting his chin, Riker said to Hernandez, "The word is given." </p><p> "And away we go," Hernandez said. She faced forward, fixed her gaze on the main viewscreen, and lifted her right arm to shoulder height. With her outstretched hand, she seemed to reach toward the darkness, straining to summon something from the void. Then it appeared, like an iris spiraling open in space: a circular tunnel filled with brilliant, pulsing blue and white rings of light, stretching away to infinity. </p><p> Lavena pressed the padd to fire the impulse engines at full power. One moment, Riker heard the hum and felt the vibrations of sublight acceleration through the deck plates; the next, he was clutching his chair's armrests as the ship slammed to a hard, thunderous halt and threw everyone forward. </p><p> "More power!" cried Hernandez over the alarm klaxons and groaning bulkheads. "I'll try to break their hold on us!" She closed her eyes, bowed her head, and raised both arms. </p><p> Riker had witnessed some of Deanna's psychic struggles in the past, and he knew that whatever Hernandez was enduring to free his ship, it had to be worse than he could imagine. "Give it all we've got!" he bellowed over the chatter of damage reports pouring in via the ops and tactical consoles. </p><p> <i>Titan</i> lurched forward, then it was inside the pulsating brightness of the subspace tunnel. Lieutenant Rriarr gripped the side of the tactical console with one paw as he reported, "High-level hyperphasic radiation inside the tunnel, Captain. Shields holding." </p><p> <i>That's why she had to modify our shields,</i> Riker realized. <i>Otherwise, we'd all be handfuls of dust by now.</i> Bone-rattling blows hammered the ship. "Report!" Riker ordered. </p><p> "Soliton pulses," Rriarr said. "From behind us." </p><p> "They're trying to bend the passage and bring us back to New Erigol," Hernandez said. "Keep that soliton field up!" </p><p> "Divert nonessential power to the deflector," Riker said. </p><p> "Belay that, sir," countered Ra-Havreii. "The gravitational shear inside the tunnel is rising. We have to reinforce the structural integrity field!" </p><p> Hernandez shot back, "Do that, and we'll lose control of the tunnel. We'll be taken back to New Erigol!" </p><p> "If we don't, the ship might be torn in half," replied the angry Efrosian engineer. Punctuating his point, a console behind him exploded and showered the bridge with stinging debris and quickly fading sparks. </p><p> Falling to her knees, Hernandez kept her arms extended and her hands up, as if she were holding back a titanic weight. "Just a few more seconds!" she cried in a plaintive voice. </p><p> The bluish-white rings of the tunnel began distorting as the black circle of its terminus became visible. "Lieutenant Rager, all available power to the deflector," Riker said. "That's an order." Another round of merciless impacts quaked the ship around him. "Hold her together, folks, we're almost out!" </p><p> An agonized groan welled up from within Hernandez as the egress point loomed large ahead of <i>Titan.</i> She arched her back and lifted her hands high above her head before unleashing a defiant, primal scream. </p><p> Outside the ship, in the tunnel, a massive ripple like a shimmer of heat radiation coursed ahead of Titan, smoothing the rings back to their perfect, circular dimensions and calming the turbulence. The shockwave rebounded off the exit ring as the Luna-class explorer hurtled through it. </p><p> Energy surges flurried the bridge's consoles, and displays spat out chaotic jumbles. A final, calamitous blast pummeled Titan, and the bridge became as dark as a moonless night. Only the feeble glow of a few tiny status gauges pierced the gloom in the long moments before the emergency lights filled the bridge with a dim, hazy radiance. </p><p> Smoke blanketed the bridge, and the deck sparkled with a fine layer of crystalline dust from demolished companels. The deck was eerily silent; there was no sound of comm chatter, no feedback tones from the computers. </p><p> "Damage report," Riker said. He surveyed the bridge for anyone able to answer him. He was met by befuddled looks and officers shaking their heads in dismay. </p><p> Ra-Havreii moved from station to station, barely pausing at each one before moving on to the next, growing more agitated every step of the way. When he reached the blank conn, he gave his drooping ivory-white mustache a pensive stroke, then turned to Riker and said, "We're blacked out, Captain. Main power's offline, along with communications, computers, and who knows what else. I'll have to go down to main engineering to get a better look at the problem." </p><p> "Go ahead," Riker said. "Power first, then communications." </p><p> "That was my plan," replied Ra-Havreii, heading for the turbolift. He all but walked into the still-closed doors before making an awkward stop, turning on his heel, and flashing an embarrassed grin. "No main power, no turbolifts." He pointed aft. "I'll just take the emergency ladder." </p><p> As the chief engineer made his abashed exit, Riker got up and walked to Hernandez's side. In slow, careful motions, he helped her stand and steady herself. "Are you all right?" </p><p> "I think so," she said. "That last pulse was a doozy. Guess I didn't know my own strength." </p><p> Riker did a double-take. "You <i>caused</i> that final pulse?" </p><p> "I had to," she said. "It was the only way to close off the passage and destroy the machine at the other end once we were clear. That'll keep the Caeliar off our backs for a while." </p><p> "Define 'a while.'" </p><p> Hernandez shrugged. "Hard to say. Depends how much damage I did and how badly the Caeliar want to come after us. Could be a few days. Could be a few decades." </p><p> "We'd better get busy making repairs, then," Riker said. </p><p> She nodded once. "That would probably be a good idea." </p><p> Riker turned to Lieutenant Rriarr. "As soon as the turbolifts are working, have Captain Hernandez escorted to quarters and placed under guard." To Hernandez, he added, "No offense." </p><p> "None taken," she replied. "After eight hundred years with the Caeliar, I'm used to being treated like a prisoner." </p><p> </p><p> Deanna Troi screamed in horror as Dr. Ree sank his fangs into her chest just below her left breast, and Ree felt absolutely terrible about it, because he was only trying to help. </p><p> The Pahkwa-thanh physician ignored Troi's frantic slaps at his head as he released a tiny amount of venom into her bloodstream. Then the half-Betazoid woman stiffened under his slender, taloned feet as the fast poison took effect. </p><p> Four sets of hands -- one pair on each arm and two pairs on his tail -- yanked h...</p></p><h2>Grass for His Pillow (Tales of the Otori, Book 2)</h2><p>Adopted by an Otori Lord, orphan Takeo rises to become a closely held member of the Tribe and finds his love for Maruyama heir Shirakawa Kaede challenged by dissembling clans and fractured allegiances.</p><p>Lian Hearn's second novel in the Tales of the Otori, <i>Grass For His Pillow</i> continues to enrich and expand his mystical imaginings of feudal Japan. Picking up where <i>Across the Nightingale Floor</i> left off, Takeo fulfills his debt of honor and accepts his heritage as a member of the superhuman cabal of assassins known as "The Tribe," and is thus ingested into their plots. But his heart yearns for Kaede, his one true love, and secretly wishes to fulfill the final wishes of his adopted father, Otori Shigaru. Meanwhile, Kaede returns to her homeland to find her father's estate in ruin and her inheritance in jeopardy. The two each encounter vast political machinations and deadly consequences as they unconsciously move toward their overwhelming urges to reunite and defy (or perhaps embrace) fate. <p> Hearn's second book into the Tales of the Otori series is a more poignant tale than the first, painfully examining the lines between honor, duty, and love. With its calming and satisfying conclusion, the landscape of Hearn's mythical vision of Japan braces for a dazzling storm in the book to come. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>Lian Hearn, born in England and currently living in Australia, has studied Japanese and has a lifelong interest in Japan.</p><h2>Wellness Foods A to Z: An Indispensable Guide for Health-Conscious Food Lovers</h2><p>In entries arranged A-Z, this authoritative bible on the new nutrition spells out the disease-fighting potential and other benefits of some 500 whole and fresh foods, and shows you how to choose foods and prepare them so you optimize their nutritional value and make them taste their best.</p><p>When the world's largest health-related newsletter began in October 1984, Sheldon Margen, a world-renowned physician, researcher, and Professor of Public Health agreed to chair the Editorial Board.

Now no one need be in any doubt as to who built the Colosseum or when Rome was sacked by the Goths: the Chronicle provides the answers, quickly and authoritatively. This is only one aspect, however, of the book&#39;s value. The biographical portraits of the 56 principal emperors from Augustus to Constantine, together with a concluding section on the later emperors, build into a highly readable single-volume history of imperial Rome. Colorful contemporary judgments by writers such as Suetonius and Tacitus are balanced by judicious character assessments made in the light of modern research. The famous and the infamous - Caligula and Claudius, Trajan and Caracalla - receive their due, while lesser names emerge clearly from the shadows for the first time. In addition to timelines detailing major events, each emperor is introduced by a coin portrait, a bust and a datafile listing key information, such as name at birth, full imperial titles, and place and manner of death. Numerous special features supplement the main narrative.Chris Scarre is Professor of Archaeology at Durham University.

Bruno, chief of police must track down a murderer while quelling his town&#39;s superstitious fears in the fifth book in this internationally bestselling series It is springtime France&#39;s Perigord, a time of beauty and calm. But not for Bruno, chief of police of the small town of St Denis. A woman&#39;s body has been found on a boat, bearing signs of a black magic ritual. Bruno has too much on his plate as it is - mediating a domestic abuse case that needs careful handling and a dodgy local development proposal that seems just too good to be true. But a murder case must take precedent and the roots of this one lie buried deep in the past - linked to a chateau above a bend in the river, to the reclusive old woman who lives there, and to the secret hidden in the Devil&#39;s Cave.</p><p>Martin Walker is a prize-winning journalist and the author of several acclaimed works of non-fiction, including The Cold War: A History. He lives in the Dordogne and Washington, DC.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruno Courr�ges seldom felt happier about the community he served as chief of police than when standing at the rear of the ancient stone church of St. Denis, listening to rehearsals of the town choir. Unlike the formal ceremonies at Mass when the singers dressed in neat white surplices, the choir practiced in their normal dress, usually gathering immediately after work. But Father Sentout&#x2019;s daring decision that the choir should reach beyond its usual repertoire to attempt Bach&#x2019;s St. Matthew Passion had required some additional rehearsals early in the morning. Farmers stood alongside schoolteachers and accountants, waitresses and shopkeepers. These were people Bruno knew, wearing clothes he recognized, and usually singing hymns that were familiar, perhaps the only memory of his church orphanage that still gave him pleasure.<br> &nbsp;<br> On this Saturday morning two weeks before Easter, the twenty-four choristers were mostly in casual clothes, and the front pews of the church were filled with coats and shop-ping baskets they would take to the town&#x2019;s market, about to get under way in the street outside. As he entered the twelfth-century church, Bruno heard the first notes that led into the chorus of &#x201c;Behold Him as a Lamb.&#x201d; The noises of the street seemed to ebb away behind him as Florence&#x2019;s pure soprano voice filled the nave. He knew there should be two choirs and two orchestras, but St. Denis made do with its trusty organ and the enthusiasm of its singers plus, of course, the determination of Father Sentout, whose love of choral music was matched only by his devotion to the pleasures of the table and the for-tunes of the local rugby team. It made him, Bruno thought, an entirely suitable pastor for this small town in the gastronomic and sporting heartland of France.<br> &nbsp;<br> The early morning sun lifted above the ridge to the east of St. Denis and flooded the top of the stained-glass window. Shafts of blue, gold and red lanced into the body of the church. Father Sentout&#x2019;s black soutane stood out against the roseate glow that now suffused the choir. Bruno&#x2019;s eye was drawn irresistibly to Florence, dressed in white with a bright red scarf at her throat. Her head was raised as she sang alone, knowing the music too well to need to look at her score. Her fair hair was lit by the sunlight into something almost like a halo.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had been one of his better moves, Bruno thought, to have found Florence the job of science teacher at the local <i>coll�ge</i>. The post brought with it a subsidized apartment on the <i>coll�ge</i> grounds, more than big enough for a divorced young woman and her infant twins. She was a fi ne addition to the life of the town and particularly to the choir. Father Sentout might not have dared attempt the <i>St. Matthew Passion</i> without her. For the first time, she seemed to notice Bruno standing in the nave. Her face softened into a smile, and she nodded to acknowledge his presence. Other choristers raised their hands in greeting. Bruno felt the familiar trembling at his waist as his mobile phone began to vibrate. Reluctantly, he slipped outside to take the call.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bruno, it&#x2019;s Marie,&#x201d; he heard. She ran the H�tel de la Gare beside the railway station, now unmanned to cut costs on rural lines in order to finance the massive investment in high-speed trains. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been asked to pass on a message. Julien Devenon says there&#x2019;s a naked woman in a boat drifting down the river. He says he saw her from the railway bridge as he walked along the line.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her voice sounded strained. Bruno thought of Julien, just entering puberty, transfixed by the sight of a naked woman. But this was troubling. Despite the spring sunshine, this was no time for sunbathing; not even for the Dutch, German and Scandinavian tourists who seemed to discard their clothes at the slightest opportunity.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He gets the train to his lyc�e in P�rigueux,&#x201d; Marie added. She paused and her voice took on a deeper note. &#x201c;He thought she was dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is Julien still there?&#x201d; Bruno pictured the boy&#x2019;s eager face as he trotted out for rugby practice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, he had to catch his train. He would have called him-self, but his dad had confiscated his phone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There would be a story behind that, Bruno thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So when did he see this boat? Was it just in the last few minutes?&#x201d; Bruno tried to calculate how long a boat drifting downstream might take to reach the great stone bridge at St. Denis, probably the nearest place he&#x2019;d be able to intercept it and bring it ashore.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He said he ran to tell me and the train was just leaving with him as I called you. So maybe three minutes ago, not much more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruno ended the conversation and darted up the rue de Paris, dodging between the market stalls and unloading trucks. He brushed aside the outstretched hands and proffered cheeks of the men and women he usually greeted twice each week on market days. He ducked under bales of cloth, dodged trolleys laden with fresh vegetables and skirted men carrying giant wheels of cheese on their heads as he made for the town square and the bridge. Just as he reached it his phone vibrated again, and this time it was Pierrot, the town&#x2019;s most dedicated fisherman.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to believe what I&#x2019;ve just seen in the river,&#x201d; he began.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A naked woman in a boat. I heard already. Where are you exactly?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By the campsite, where the bank is high. There&#x2019;s a bend in the river there and the trout&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How fast is the river moving that boat?&#x201d; Bruno interrupted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Five minutes and it will be at the bridge, maybe a bit more,&#x201d; Pierrot said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty waterlogged. One of those old fl at-bottomed boats, haven&#x2019;t seen one for years. Thing is, Bruno, she&#x2019;s lying on her back, naked as a worm, arms out-stretched. I think she&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find out. Thanks, Pierrot,&#x201d; said Bruno, closing his phone as he reached the stone bridge. He looked upstream, blinking against the dazzle of the sun on water. There was no sign of a boat, so he had a little time. He punched the autodial for the medical center into his phone and asked for Fabiola.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not on today,&#x201d; said Juliette at the reception desk. &#x201c;Something about a private patient, which I never heard of before. I&#x2019;ll put you through to Dr. Gelletreau. He&#x2019;s on call today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother,&#x201d; said Bruno, talking as he walked briskly back to the church, ducking and weaving through the obstacle course of market stalls. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time to talk. Just tell the doctor to get to the stone bridge where it looks like we might have a dead body floating downstream. I&#x2019;ll meet him there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He needed Antoine, with a canoe, and Antoine was in the choir. He slipped in through the small portal that was cut into the huge wooden doors and was rocked by the sheer volume the choir was now generating, one half singing &#x201c;See him!&#x201d; and the other half replying &#x201c;Whom?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Just before Florence could soar into the solo &#x201c;O Lamb of God Most Holy,&#x201d; Bruno strode forward to tap Father Sentout on the shoulder. The choir stopped raggedly, uncertain, but the organ notes swept on, and Father Sentout opened his eyes, blinking in surprise at the sight of Bruno.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Father, it&#x2019;s an emergency,&#x201d; said Bruno, his voice loud to carry over the organ. &#x201c;There could be a life at stake. I need Antoine most urgently.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The organ music stopped with a dying wheeze from the pipes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You want my Jesus?&#x201d; the priest asked, uncertainly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruno swallowed hard, trying to comprehend the meaning of the question. Then he remembered that Antoine was singing the role of Jesus.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a waterman and there&#x2019;s a body floating down the river,&#x201d; Bruno said, speaking to the choir as much as to Father Sentout. &#x201c;A woman, in a boat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a canoe nearby,&#x201d; Antoine said, striding down from the apse and picking up a jacket from the front pew. A burly man, he had wide and powerful shoulders from a lifetime of paddling and manhandling canoes. &#x201c;My canoes are all back at the campsite today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need you anyway,&#x201d; said Bruno. He led the way through the thickening market crowd and back to the river, suddenly aware that most of the choir seemed to be following, along with Father Sentout.<br> &nbsp;<br> Passersby and some of the stallholders looked up at the swelling line behind Bruno, and with the automatic curiosity that draws a crowd when people sense a drama unfolding they joined behind. Soon they were clustering at the side of the bridge as Bruno and Antoine spotted the vessel they were expecting tracing lazy circles as it drifted with the current.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It might get caught up on the sandbank,&#x201d; said Antoine. &#x201c;Otherwise we&#x2019;d better get down to my campsite and take out a canoe, tow it ashore.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Could I wade into the river and catch it here?&#x201d; Bruno asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Better not,&#x201d; said Antoine, demonstrating why Bruno had been right to interrupt the choir and summon the boatman. &#x201c;See that current where it comes through the first arch of the bridge? That&#x2019;s the deep channel. You&#x2019;d be up to your neck or even deeper. You wouldn&#x2019;t have the footing to drag it ashore.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> More and more of the townsfolk were gathering on the bridge, craning their necks to watch the boat draw steadily nearer. Among them, camera at the ready, was Philippe Delaron from the photography shop, who doubled as the local correspondent for <i>Sud</i> <i>Ouest</i>. Bruno groaned inwardly. A ghoulish newspaper photo of a corpse in a boat was not the image of St. Denis that he or the mayor would seek to portray.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a punt,&#x201d; said Antoine, surprise in his voice. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen one of those in a long time. They used them for hunting wildfowl in the old days before they built the dams upriver, when we still had wetlands with the flooding every spring.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Should we head for your campsite and get the canoe?&#x201d; Bruno was eager to do something.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Better wait and see if it gets through the current around the bridge,&#x201d; said Antoine, lighting a yellow cigarette, a Gitane <i>Ma�s</i>. Bruno had forgotten they still made them. &#x201c;If it founders, there&#x2019;s no point. And it might still get stuck on the sandbank. If it doesn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ve got an idea. Follow me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Antoine thrust his way back through the crowd and down the steep and narrow stone steps that led from the bridge to the quay where the annual fishing contests were held. Three fishermen sat on their folding stools, each watching his own float and casting the occasional sidelong glance to see if his neighbors were having better luck. None of them seemed to pay much attention to the crowd on the bridge.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Patrice, can you cast a line into that drifting boat and see if you can pull it into the bank?&#x201d; Antoine asked the first of the anglers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Patrice half turned and eyed Antoine sourly. He mumbled something through closed lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; Bruno asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Patrice opened his mouth and took out three wriggling maggots from where he&#x2019;d kept them under his tongue. It was something Bruno had seen the baron do when they went fi shing. Maggots were sluggish in the chill of the morning, and a devoted fisherman would put some in his mouth to get them warm and energetic enough to attract fish once they were on the hook. It was one of the reasons Bruno knew he&#x2019;d never be a real angler.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll lose my bait, could lose a hook and line,&#x201d; Patrice said, putting his maggots back into the old tobacco can where he kept his bait. He paused, squinting against the sun. &#x201c;Is this your business, Bruno?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruno outlined the discovery to Patrice, a small, hunched man, married for forty years to a woman twice his size with a loud and penetrating voice to match. That probably explained the amount of time he spent fishing, Bruno had often thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d try it myself, but you&#x2019;re the best man with a rod and line,&#x201d; Bruno said. He had learned back in his army days that a little flattery was the easiest way to turn a reluctant conscript into an enthusiastic volunteer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Across the river, a white open-topped sports car with sweeping lines raced around the corner of the medical center to the bank where the trailers parked. It braked hard and stopped, wheels spitting up gravel. A fair-haired young man climbed out dressed as if for tennis in the 1930s. He wore a white sports shirt and cream trousers with a colorful belt and ran toward the riverbank shedding his shirt. He paused on the bank to remove his white tennis shoes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The guy&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; said Antoine, spitting out his cigarette. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to dive in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind him another figure stepped gracefully from the car, a woman with remarkably long legs, dressed in black tights and what looked like a man&#x2019;s white shirt, tightly belted with a black sash. Her face was pale and her hair covered in a black turban. The way she moved made Bruno think of a ballerina. She advanced to the bank beside the fair-haired man, and they looked upriver as if trying to assess when the punt might be in reach. The man began wading into the shallows as Bruno called out to him to stop.<br> &nbsp;<br> Patrice had his line out of the water. He had removed his bait and fl oat and was fixing his heaviest hook, looking up every few seconds to watch the speed of the punt&#x2019;s approach.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Stand aside and don&#x2019;t get behind me. This will be a hell of a cast.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Standing at the riverbank, Bruno could see nothing of the dead woman. But something close to three feet tall and black was standing up in the punt, almost like a very short mast. Antoine shrugged when Bruno asked him what it might be.<br> &nbsp;<br> The punt&#x2019;s corner seemed to catch on the edge of the sandbank, and it slowed and turned as if heading for the far bank. Bruno heard cheers and whistles coming from the crowd on the bridge as the young man plunged deeper, assuming that the shallows ran all the way to the sandbank. They didn&#x2019;t, and he sank beneath the surface, then rose, shaking his head and striking out for the punt in a powerful crawl.<br> &nbsp;<br> But some eddy or wayward current caught the vessel and pushed it free of the sandbank and into the deeper, faster cur-rent where it begin drifting toward Bruno&#x2019;s side of the bank. Patrice tensed, lifted his rod over his head and cast high and far. Bruno watched as the line snaked out and the hook and sinker landed just on the far side of the punt, and held.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; said Patrice, almost to himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man in the water suddenly stopped. He must have reached the sandbank. He stood and staggered across it to where the punt was fast moving out of his reach and launched himself into a desperate, flailing dive almost as if he wanted to land inside the punt itself. One hand landed hard on the fl at rear corner, and the punt rocked so that water slopped over its side.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The stupid bastard&#x2019;s going to sink it,&#x201d; said Antoine.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the punt tipped toward him, Bruno caught a glimpse of the woman, her fair hair glin...</p><h2>The Clue in the Diary (Nancy Drew, Book 7)</h2><p>Nancy uses a lost diary to exonerate an innocent prisoner.</p><p>Carolyn Keene is the author of the ever-popular Nancy Drew (All New) Girl Detective and Nancy Drew and the Clue Crew series.Nancy is approaching a house when, suddenly, it explodes and erupts in flames.

Faber&#x2019;s novel is entirely true to itself and wonderfully original. It makes a fine update to Walter M.

The result&nbsp;is a novel of marvel and wonderment with a narrative engine like a locomotive.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Yann Martel</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In my opinion <i>The Book of Strange New Things</i> is Michel Faber&#x2019;s second masterpiece, quite different to <i>The Crimson Petal and the White</i> but every bit as luminescent and memorable.&nbsp; It is a portrait of a living, breathing relationship, frayed by distance.&nbsp; It is an enquiry into the mountains faith can move and the mountains faith can&#x2019;t move.&nbsp; It is maniacally gripping.&nbsp; It is vibrant with wit and overcast with prescience and social commentary.&nbsp; Like all superlative science fiction, its real subject is that most mystifying of alien species, humanity. I didn&#x2019;t so much read <i>The Book of Strange New Things</i> as inhabit it, the way you inhabited that handful of books which, as a kid, first got you hooked on this wonderful drug known as reading.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>David Mitchell</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Michel Faber&#x2019;s <i>The Book of Strange New Things</i> certainly lives up to its title.&nbsp; Faber, as he showed in <i>Under the Skin</i>, does strangeness brilliantly. I can&#x2019;t remember being so continually and unfailingly surprised by any book for a long time, and part of the surprise is the tenderness and delicacy with which he shows an emotional relationship developing in one direction while withering in another.

Reading it at a lonely moment, I found that I responded easily to the confident muscularity of her prose and the intimate way she described emotional states.

Although the novel purports to cover the life of the painter, the painting serves as a touchstone, foreshadowing Artemisia's rape by Agostino Tassi, an assistant in her father's painting studio in Rome; the well-documented (and humiliating) trial that followed; the early days of her hastily arranged marriage; and her eventual triumph as the first woman elected to the Accademia dell' Arte in Florence. Although Vreeland makes a bit free with her characters (which she admits in her introduction), attributing some decidedly modern attitudes to people who would not have thought that way at the time, her book is beautifully researched and rich with casual detail of clothing, interiors, and street life. She deftly works history and politics into the background of her canvas, keeping her focus on Artemisia and her family. Beyond the paintings Artemisia left behind, Vreeland's vision may be as close as we can come to understanding the anger and ambition that kept this talented woman at the doors of the Accademia, demanding entrance, in a time when respectable women rarely left their homes. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Artemisia Gentileschi burst upon the post-Renaissance art scene with all the drama of an Italian opera. When I learned that she was the first woman to be admitted to the Accademia dell' Arte in Florence, producing paintings of startling invention which expressed a feminist sensibility, and the first woman to make her living solely by her brush, and furthermore, that she was raped at seventeen by her father's friend, her teacher, I knew I'd found material for a novel. <p>Rather than focusing on the rape or using a broad brush to paint a sweeping biography, I chose to explore the inner Artemisia, her developing state of mind, her transcendence over misfortune and resentment, the possibilities of forgiveness and love in a ruptured life, and the connecting tissue of beauty, art, spirituality, and wholeness. </p><p>Such a focused work of fiction about an historical person must be a work of the imagination, true to the time and character always, but true to facts only so long as fact furnishes believable drama. To suit my purposes, I combined actual people into composite characters, eliminated others, and invented still others. Though I used the trial record, her paintings, and her associations with Galileo, Cosimo de' Medici II, and Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger as recorded in art histories, I imagined the personalities and interactions of Artemisia, her father and her husband, and devised dramatic moments that would propel a plot. This is the process by which an historic figure moves from yellowed archives to scholarship, and from academic interest to heroic popular legend, becoming more complex and beloved as a result. With The Passion of Artemisia, I wanted to participate in giving Artemisia her cultural moment.</p></p><h2>Culinaria Germany: A Celebration of Food and Tradition</h2><p><p>From matjes herrings served with green beans to a Rhineland-style sauerbraten (literally, "sour roast") or maultaschen, the Swabian answer to ravioli: in its 380 compact pages Culinaria Germany presents all of the most popular recipes gleaned from every corner of the country.Detailed and thoroughly illustrated reports show the food in the making, inviting readers to cook their way through each of Germany&#x2019;s sixteen regions.

In those days, his testicular balloon bag may actually have been even more voluminous than it is today, though that's difficult to imagine since his balls very nearly drag the ground as it is, and any increase in volume would surely have been an impediment to mobility if, indeed, not a source of some pain. There is also the possibility that Tanuki had (and perhaps still has) the power to increase or decrease scrotum size at will.<br><br>Yet, having said all that, we must concede that the role of anatomical size per se in Tanuki's descent is not easy to determine, and a more pertinent question might be not how the badger managed to use his significant seed sack to parachute to earth but, rather: Where did he parachute from?

No girl would have anything to do with a funny-looking creature like you."<br><br>"Don't be too sure, old fool," snarled Tanuki, and with that he butted the farmer in the midsection with such force that the man fell to the ground, speechless, gasping for breath. Then, on his hind legs, round belly jiggling like a Santa Claus implant, the badger waddled over to the well where the man's daughter was filling water jars, and fixed her with his toothy, high-voltage grin, a smile so overheated and manic and wild it could crack a funhouse mirror or peel the lacquer off the chopsticks in a maiden's hair.<br><br>What immediately follows is a brief, and only partial, clarification concerning Tanuki's nature. To wit: while virtually everyone refers to him as a "badger," to the point where<br><br>"Badger" is practically his second name, the scientific truth is, Tanuki is not a badger at all. Any zoologist will gladly point out that tanukis are a species of East Asian wild dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), possessing the long snout, coloration, and markings of a raccoon, although lacking the raccoon's famous ringed tail.<br><br>The fact that tanukis are nearly tailless, coupled with their penchant for standing upright on their hind legs, undoubtedly plays a role in Tanuki's being so generally regarded in an anthropomorphic light. At the edge of a dark forest, it would be fairly easy for the impressionable to mistake a tanuki for a little man. But, thanks to his otherworldly powers, there happens to be an even more legitimate reason for Tanuki's anthropomorphic reputation, as we shall soon enough find out.<br><br>Before moving on, however, we must address the probability that the perceptive reader will have noticed in our narration an apparent and perhaps troubling inconsistency. Unless the author is simply too careless and sloppy to be trusted, why does he sometimes write "Tanuki" (singular, individual, a capitalized proper noun) and at other times, even in the same paragraph, write "tanukis" (plural, generic, an uncapitalized common noun)? The explanation is simple. This badgerish creature, like God, is both one and many.<br><br>Both. In the same instant. Like God.<br><br>As anybody who knows anything about the Unknowable well knows, "God" and "gods" are interchangeable. The exclusivistic patriarchal Jehovah/Allah freaks are not incorrect when they insist that there is but one Supreme Being and that "he" is immutable and absolute. However, neither are the wide-eyed inclusive pagans and primitives wrong when they recognize gods of fire alongside gods of rivers; honor a moon goddess, a crocodile spirit, and deities who reside in, among countless other places, tree trunks, rain clouds, peyote buttons, and neon lighting (especially the flashing whites and the greens).<br><br>Thus, if the reader is wise enough not to try to impose<br><br>human limitations or narrow notions of uniformity on the<br><br>Divine Principle, is nimble-minded enough to realize that he or she can be (perhaps should be!) simultaneously monotheistic and pantheistic, then he or she will have scant problem in accepting the paradoxical essence of our small friend, Tanuki of the tanukis.<br><br>At first, the daughter at the well seemed prepared to accept Tanuki's invitation to lie down with him. She was a farm girl, after all, and the mating activities of animals were as familiar to her as the sprouting of rice or the ripening of plums. Likewise, bestiality was not unknown to her, for she had brothers, cousins, and young male neighbors who, from time to time, were prone to so indulge. If we seldom if ever hear of girls participating in such sordid practices, it's certainly not because rural girls are any less lustful than their masculine counterparts. Perhaps it's due, rather, to the universal girlish character, which is cleaner, more restrained, sensitive, and finer-grained than that of the hopelessly coarse adolescent male. Or, it may only be a matter of logistics: it's one thing for a hormone-racked boy to mount a ewe, but a maid presenting herself to a ram is so awkward an enterprise as to be nearly unthinkable. It would test the girl's ingenuity and probably confuse the ram.<br><br>Still, Tanuki was no ordinary beast. He walked upright, had a charming accent, a confident and exotic manner, and a riveting, if somewhat unnerving, grin. So cute was he, and so persuasive, that she soon found herself loosening her kimono. Alas, when he commenced to boast about how he had recently parachuted to earth from the Other World, she grew frightened, ran away, and bolted the farmhouse door behind her. "I thought I saw a demon," she told her mother, to explain her blush and why she'd returned home without water.<br><br>Dejected, Tanuki stole a small jar of sake from its cooling place in the well and lumbered off into the forest to brood. At some point during the night, when he was quite tipsy, he began to drum on his protruding belly, as tanukis are wont to do, and the pla-bonga pla-bonga sound of his drumming eventually attracted a kitsune. A fox.<br><br>"You idiot," Kitsune scolded him, after Tanuki had bemoaned his woeful failure. "How could you be so naive as to tell a human being the truth? Men live by embedding themselves in ongoing systems of illusion. Religion. Patriotism. Economics. Fashion. That sort of thing. If you wish to gain the favor of the two-legged ilk, you must learn to fabricate as wholeheartedly as they do. Actually, by sabotaging their static illusions, we can sometimes help turn their stale deceptions into fresh possibilities for their race, but that's probably a mission you're neither interested in nor suited for. So, just lie to people any way you see fit and reap what benefits you can--but do bear in mind that you should never, ever lie to yourself."<br><br>Much of the fox's wisdom was lost on the drunken badger, but he'd grasped one important fact, and the following dusk when he approached the farmer's daughter at the well, he took a different tack. "My pretty cherry flower," he rasped, "I am, in fact, merely a simple beast of the woods who has become enchanted by your beauty and yesterday was driven to misspeak due to the intensity of my desire to hold your sweet hand and nuzzle your exquisite neck."<br><br>"Oh my," gasped the girl. And she watched him with a mixture of pity, vanity, and awe as his tiny fingers undid her sash.<br><br>Afterward, leaving the girl exhausted on the moss, Tanuki rapped at the farmer's door. "Ten thousand pardons, honorable sir," he said, bowing deeply. "In addition to the impolite interjection of my head bone into yesterday's conversation, I'm afraid I also told a little fib. Look at me, sir. Look me over. Obviously, I'm no Animal Ancestor. Damned ridiculous! No, I'm merely a poor orphan of the woodlands, temporarily down on his luck and maddeningly hungry. Both frogs and wild onions are scarce this season, and my ravenous self would be forever in your debt if you might spare . . ."<br><br>Somewhat apprehensively, the farmer set a bowl of boiled rice by the kitchen door. Tanuki proceeded to eat, taking deliberately dainty bites, chewing very, very slowly; and when his host grew bored and turned his attention to some household chore, the badger suddenly seized a cask of sake quite as large as himself and, short legs pumping, heavy scrotum swinging, escaped with it into the brush, one step ahead of the farmer's ax.<br><br>That night Tanuki got snockered so enthusiastically that the sake got snockered along with him. He thumped his full belly--pla-bonga pla-bonga--and his grin fought a duel with the moon.<br><br>Tanuki relished homemade sake. He liked dancing his drum...</p><h2>Masters of Death: The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust</h2><p>A major contribution to the history of the Holocaust from the acclaimed author of the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <b>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</b>.<br><br>In <b>Masters of Death</b>, Richard Rhodes gives full weight, for the first time, to the part played by the Einsatzgruppen--the professional killing squads deployed in Poland and the Soviet Union, early in World War II, by Himmler's SS. And he shows how these squads were utilized as the Nazis made two separate plans for dealing with the civilian populations they wanted to destroy. <br><br>The first plan, initiated in July 1941, condemned the Jews of eastern Europe to slaughter by the Einsatzgruppen, who went on to execute 1.5 million men, women and children between 1941 and 1943 by shooting them into killing pits, as at Babi Yar--massive crimes that have been underestimated or overlooked by Holocaust historians. Rhodes documents the organizing and carrying out of this program and introduces the professional men--economists, architects, lawyers--who were the program&#x2019;s commanders and officers, as well as the "ordinary men" who did most of the actual killing.<br><br>The second plan, initiated in December 1941, was directed at the Jews of western Europe. By then, Rhodes shows, the face-to-face killing of hundreds of thousands had so brutalized the SS that even Himmler was shocked into ordering the development of a less "personal" means of murder--the notorious gas chambers and crematoria of the Holocaust&#x2019;s second wave. Rhodes shows, further, that Hitler and Himmler intended the Jews to be only their first victims; their plan was to open up Russia to German colonization by destroying more than 30 million Slavs and members of other ethnic groups.<br><br>Drawing on Nuremberg Tribunal documents largely ignored until now, and on newly available material from eyewitnesses and survivors, Richard Rhodes has given us a book that is essential reading on the Holocaust and World War II.</p><p><i>Masters of Death</i> is Richard Rhodes's chronological account of the Third Reich's <i>Einsatzgruppen</i> (a hand-picked task force) and its death work--the executions of 1.5 million people, Jews and non-Jews--in Russia and Eastern Europe from 1941 through 1943. Rhodes sees these operations (the victims were, almost exclusively, shot) as a ghastly prelude to the subsequent (and much more written-about) horrors of the death camps. In chilling--and occasionally excessive--detail, Rhodes describes the killings and the reasons behind the Reich's cautious, rather than precipitous, escalation of the same: the military's "concern for German and world opinion"; the need to improve methodology; and finally, the need to "condition" the troops, thereby avoiding "disabling trauma." Rhodes makes good use of firsthand accounts and outlines the effects the larger war (Pearl Harbor; the failure to defeat Britain) had on Hitler's attempted obliteration of European Jewry. His chapters on the nature of evil seem hurried and not particularly fresh. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>"To read Richard Rhodes's book on the infamous SS murder squads is to follow him to the brink of absolute evil and its cold, calculated and blood-chilling brutality. What made normal citizens, some of them with college degrees, into mass murderers of children and their parents? This haunting question fills these pages with pain and anguish. This is an important and enormously powerful book."<br>-- Elie Wiesel</p><h2>Leading with a Limp: Turning Your Struggles into Strengths</h2><p><b>Put your flawed foot forward.</b><br><br>Pick up most leadership books and you&#x2019;ll find strategies for leveraging your power and minimizing your areas of weakness. But think about the leaders whose names have gone down in history. Most of them were so messed up that, if they were looking for work today, no executive placement service would give them the time of day. <br><br>God&#x2019;s criteria for choosing leaders runs counter to the conventional wisdom. Our culture equates strength with effectiveness, but God favors leaders who know the value of brokenness. <br><br>In <i>Leading With a Limp</i>, you&#x2019;ll discover what makes flawed leaders so successful. They&#x2019;re not preoccupied with protecting their image, they are undaunted by chaos and complexity, they are ready to risk failure in moving an organization from what is to what should be. God chooses leaders who aren&#x2019;t deceived by the myths of power and control, but who realize that God&#x2019;s power is found in brokenness. <br><br>If you are a leader&#x2013;or if you have been making excuses to avoid leading&#x2013;find out how you can take full advantage of your weakness. A limping leader is the person God uses to accomplish amazing things. <br><br><b>To go deeper, check out the <i>Leading With a Limp Workbook.<br></i></b></p><p><b>Dan B. Allender, PhD, </b>is a founder of Mars Hill Graduate School near Seattle, where he serves as president. He also is a professor of counseling, a therapist in private practice, and a popular speaker. He is the author of a number of books, including <i>To Be Told, How Children Raise Parents, The Healing Path, </i>and <i>The Wounded Heart.</i> Dan and his wife, Rebecca, are the parents of three children.<br><b><br></b>A LEADERSHIP CONFESSION<br>Flight Is the Only Sane Response<br><b><br>I don&#x2019;t pet stray dogs. I was bitten on the hand when I was six. I recall watching this immaculately coiffed collie bound out of a neighbor&#x2019;s yard to greet me. Its elegant, effortless movement mesmerized me. I put my hand out and, in a split second, went from being a dog lover to a child wounded in hand and heart. Since that day I&#x2019;ve never fully trusted a foreign pooch. I am dog scarred&#x2014;a tad suspicious, but still open to man&#x2019;s best friend. The same is true in my approach to leaders known as pastors. I seldom pet a strange or even a well-known pastor. This came about after I was bitten at age twenty-six. As a lowly intern in a local church, I was earning a whopping fifty dollars a week for services that included leading a bible study, visiting church members, and walking the senior pastor&#x2019;s dog. I worked with the pastor for more than a year, and after I graduated from seminary, I came back as an assistant pastor.<br>The senior pastor and I often played tennis together, and after one afternoon match we sat and talked about some of the things he wanted me to tackle in the coming year. He was my mentor, and I was his apt disciple. But it is also true that even though I had graduated from a fine seminary, I had the maturity of a street kid who had barely escaped death, jail, and excessive brain damage due to illicit drugs, and I had little idea how to function in the business of organized religion. The church was as foreign to me as the Junior League.<br>I was grateful beyond words to have a job and a future with this man and his church. We left the tennis court at five o&#x2019;clock and reconvened in an elders&#x2019; meeting at six. An hour into the meeting, the senior pastor said to the leaders of our church, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come to the decision that it is best for Dan and the church to part ways.&#x201d; He offered no explanation. It was a clean, simple bite. Several of the elders felt the decision was abrupt and without due diligence, so I kept my job for another eighteen months. But the handwriting was on the wall. We leaders are dangerous. They can bite without provocation or at least without logic, and it is best to stay out of their way or you&#x2019;ll have to deal with the consequences. Leaders can seem capricious, aloof, narcissistic, and selfinterested. I wanted little to do with their world, so I left the complex world<br>of church politics and the rough-and-tumble culture of leadership to work on my doctorate. But I didn&#x2019;t escape political turmoil.<br>The academic realm involves politics similar to the clan warfare of early marauding tribes. It is all about loyalty&#x2014;allegiance to the tartan, flag, and set of convictions that mark your community as unique. If you can wield a broadax or sword well enough and speak the language of the clan, your position is secure until death. This is called tenure. I entered the clan convinced that I would never again lead any group, community, church, school, or sports team as long as I lived. In fact, one of the great advantages of being an academic was that I was expected to complain about the administration, but I didn&#x2019;t have to take on any leadership responsibilities beyond teaching my classes. <br>Umpteen years later, six colleagues and I wrestled with the decision of whether to apply for accreditation for the graduate school we had haphazardly started in Seattle. We were in a quandary: The school that had allowed us to be a branch campus no longer wanted us. If we chose to disband, we would face humiliation as well as the possibility of lawsuits stemming from the school&#x2019;s inability to fulfill its promise of offering degrees. We decided to apply for accreditation. The application required the signature of the school&#x2019;s presi dent&#x2014;a position we had never discussed. We really didn&#x2019;t think we needed a president because we planned to operate as a nonhierarchical guild of peers without a central, decision-making figure. We would be a community, not an organization.<br>When the moment came for the president to sign the application, all heads in the room dropped, including my own. An awkward half minute ensued, and I looked up. Someone noticed my movement and said, &#x201c;You are the oldest and the best known.&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;Okay, but you all know I m not really the president.&#x201d; Everyone laughed. It was as obvious as a scream in the ear: I&#x2019;d take the title, and we would all share the power and responsibility. The dream of a nonhierarchical community of peers collapsed under conflicting expectations, bruised feelings, immorality, and&#x2014;thank God&#x2014;a board that intervened and began naming failures upon failures, and called us to become an organization and leaders. We&#x2019;ve been in the process for six years, and I am still president. I don&#x2019;t deserve to be. Perhaps that is one of the reasons I am still asked to serve in this capacity.<br>Everything I despised in other leaders I have replicated in our organization. Many times I have acted precipitously in panic before gathering sufficient data. Many other times I have failed to act at all. If in one circumstance I act too slowly, it seems that I act too quickly in the next. Leadership feels like playing the slot machine in a casino. You put your best capital into the machine, pull the lever, watch the wheels spin, and come up empty handed. The question lingers: what am I doing wrong?<br>My colleagues and I have gone through enormous heartache and tremendous change. We are still in the middle of profound transformation, and there are days I wonder if I will survive to see the sun rise again. Last night I tossed myself through a midnight aerobics workout that continued to the early side of three o&#x2019;clock in the morning. I worried, prayed, and worried about personnel matters, finances, future hires, the school&#x2019;s reputation in the community, tensions among the faculty, and a host of other concerns that zapped my mind like moths flying into a bug light.<br>No doubt every leader feels the constant and chronic weight of obstacles, but it isn&#x2019;t one problem or even a whole set that eats our lunch; it&#x2019;s that each problem requires a response that seldom resolves the issue. Instead, the response simply creates multiple new problems. The weedlike problem seems to have a pod stuffed with countless seeds that will be sown the moment it is pulled, seeds that will result in a host of new weeds. And if that trouble isn&#x2019;t hard enough to swallow, the real issue is more personal&#x2014;having to do with the decisions and choices a leader must make, alone. Few decisions are simple. In fact, simple decisions are better called choices.<br>Do I want to eat now or wait for my wife to get home? Do we cancel classes when there is a foot of snow in Seattle? We make choices every day that require little thought, have few consequences, and are completed without much need for reflection or counsel. Leaders choose daily, but the real weight on their shoulders lies in the need to <i>decide. </i>And there are no easy decisions. To decide requires a death, a dying to a thousand options, the putting aside of a legion of possibilities in order to choose just one. De-cide. Homo-cide. Sui-cide. Patri-cide. The root word <i>decidere </i>means &#x201c;to cut off.&#x201d; All decisions cut us off, separate us, from nearly infinite options as we select just one single path. And every decision we make earns us the favor of some and the disfavor of others.<br>Budgetary decisions, for instance, seldom involve equal distribution of the finite resource we call money. The child who begins college may require most of a family&#x2019;s disposable income. As a result, the rest of the family can&#x2019;t take their summer vacation to the mountains. The decision blesses one and alienates others.<br>A good leader will, in time, disappoint everyone. Leadership requires a willingness to not be liked, in fact, a willingness to be hated. But it is impossible to lead people who doubt you and hate you. So the constant tug is to make the decision that is the least offensive to the greatest number and then to align yourself with those who have the most power to sustain your position and reputation in the organization. Leadership is not about problems and decisions; it is a profoundly relational enterprise that seeks to motivate people toward a vision that will require significant change and risk on everyone&#x2019;s part. Decisions are simply the doors that leaders, as well as followers, walk through to get to the land where redemption can be found.<br><br>FLIGHT IS THE ONLY SANE RESPONSE<br>There are two common stories I hear from students who come to Mars Hill Graduate School. One group of students will say, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to be here. I was working in Washington DC/Portland/Charlotte/Chicago. I loved my job, my church, and my friends, but in a matter of months my life was turned upside down. It felt like God spun me around, headed me west, and here I am, not really sure why. But I am here, and I sense that this is where I am meant to be.&#x201d;<br>The other group will say, &#x201c;I knew this is where I wanted to study. I heard about the school through a book/a seminar/a student, and I have wanted to be here for years. But since I&#x2019;ve come, I feel like I&#x2019;m going through a crisis of confidence. I don&#x2019;t know if this is really what I am supposed to do. I&#x2019;m afraid, and I feel crazy for ever thinking I wanted to come here.&#x201d;<br>Doubt is the context for surrender. And flight is the path for obedience. When we&#x2019;re reluctant to lead, doubting ourselves and our call, we are ripe for growth as a leader. Likewise, when we hear the call to lead but we run in the opposite direction, God has a way of having us thrown off the boat, swallowed by a large fish, and spit onto the shore where we are to serve. If the situation weren&#x2019;t so serious, it would be hilarious. God invites us to run and yet to know that he will arrive at our place of flight before we arrive so he can direct our steps...</b></p><h2>Junior Great Books Series 7 : Student Anthology</h2><p>Contains the following short stories: Harrison Bergeron by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. I Just Kept On Smiling by Simon Burt At Her Father&#39;s and Her Mother&#39;s Place by Natalya Baranskaya The White Circle by John Bell Clayton The Zodiacs by Jay Neugeboren End of the Game by Julio Cort�zar The Cat and the Coffee Drinkers by Max Steele Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl (selection) The Secret Lion by Alberto Alvaro Rios Day of the Butterfly by Alice Munro A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens</p><p></p><h2>The Complete ElfQuest Graphic Novel, Book 5: Siege at Blue Mountain</h2><p>The Wolfriders, a band of elves, search for others of their kind in a savage Earthlike world.</p><p></p><h2>Harcourt Science, Grade 2</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

A given amount of emission will lead to a given amount of temperature increase that will lead to a given amount of smooth incremental sea level rise. However, the geological record for the climate reflects instances where a relatively small change in one element of climate led to abrupt changes in the system as a whole. In other words, pushing global temperatures past certain thresholds could trigger abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes that have massively disruptive and large-scale impacts. At that point, even if we do not add any additional CO2 to the atmosphere, potentially unstoppable processes are set in motion. We can think of this as sudden climate brake and steering failure where the problem and its consequences are no longer something we can control.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Report by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world&#x2019;s largest general scientific society, 20141<br> <br>&#x201c;I love that smell of the emissions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Sarah Palin, 20112<br> <br>A voice came over the intercom: would the passengers of Flight 3935, scheduled to depart Washington, D.C., for Charleston, South Carolina, kindly collect their carry-on luggage and get off the plane.<br> <br>They went down the stairs and gathered on the hot tarmac. There they saw something unusual: the wheels of the US Airways jet had sunk into the black pavement as if it were wet cement. The wheels were lodged so deep, in fact, that the truck that came to tow the plane away couldn&#x2019;t pry it loose. The airline had hoped that without the added weight of the flight&#x2019;s thirty-five passengers, the aircraft would be light enough to pull. It wasn&#x2019;t. Someone posted a picture: &#x201c;Why is my flight cancelled? Because DC is so damn hot that our plane sank 4" into the pavement.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Eventually, a larger, more powerful vehicle was brought in to tow the plane and this time it worked; the plane finally took off, three hours behind schedule. A spokesperson for the airline blamed the incident on &#x201c;very unusual temperatures.&#x201d;4<br> <br>The temperatures in the summer of 2012 were indeed unusually hot. (As they were the year before and the year after.) And it&#x2019;s no mystery why this has been happening: the profligate burning of fossil fuels, the very thing that US Airways was bound and determined to do despite the inconvenience presented by a melting tarmac. This irony&#x2014;the fact that the burning of fossil fuels is so radically changing our climate that it is getting in the way of our capacity to burn fossil fuels&#x2014;did not stop the passengers of Flight 3935 from reembarking and continuing their journeys. Nor was climate change mentioned in any of the major news coverage of the incident.<br> <br>I am in no position to judge these passengers. All of us who live high consumer lifestyles, wherever we happen to reside, are, metaphorically, passengers on Flight 3935. Faced with a crisis that threatens our survival as a species, our entire culture is continuing to do the very thing that caused the crisis, only with an extra dose of elbow grease behind it. Like the airline bringing in a truck with a more powerful engine to tow that plane, the global economy is upping the ante from conventional sources of fossil fuels to even dirtier and more dangerous versions&#x2014;bitumen from the Alberta tar sands, oil from deepwater drilling, gas from hydraulic fracturing (fracking), coal from detonated mountains, and so on.<br> <br>Meanwhile, each supercharged natural disaster produces new irony-laden snapshots of a climate increasingly inhospitable to the very industries most responsible for its warming. Like the 2013 historic floods in Calgary that forced the head offices of the oil companies mining the Alberta tar sands to go dark and send their employees home, while a train carrying flammable petroleum products teetered on the edge of a disintegrating rail bridge. Or the drought that hit the Mississippi River one year earlier, pushing water levels so low that barges loaded with oil and coal were unable to move for days, while they waited for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge a channel (they had to appropriate funds allocated to rebuild from the previous year&#x2019;s historic flooding along the same waterway). Or the coal-fired power plants in other parts of the country that were temporarily shut down because the waterways that they draw on to cool their machinery were either too hot or too dry (or, in some cases, both).<br> <br>Living with this kind of cognitive dissonance is simply part of being alive in this jarring moment in history, when a crisis we have been studiously ignoring is hitting us in the face&#x2014;and yet we are doubling down on the stuff that is causing the crisis in the first place.<br> <br>I denied climate change for longer than I care to admit. I knew it was happening, sure. Not like Donald Trump and the Tea Partiers going on about how the continued existence of winter proves it&#x2019;s all a hoax. But I stayed pretty hazy on the details and only skimmed most of the news stories, especially the really scary ones. I told myself the science was too complicated and that the environmentalists were dealing with it. And I continued to behave as if there was nothing wrong with the shiny card in my wallet attesting to my &#x201c;elite&#x201d; frequent flyer status.<br> <br>A great many of us engage in this kind of climate change denial. We look for a split second and then we look away. Or we look but then turn it into a joke (&#x201c;more signs of the Apocalypse!&#x201d;). Which is another way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves comforting stories about how humans are clever and will come up with a technological miracle that will safely suck the carbon out of the skies or magically turn down the heat of the sun. Which, I was to discover while researching this book, is yet another way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but try to be hyper-rational about it (&#x201c;dollar for dollar it&#x2019;s more efficient to focus on economic development than climate change, since wealth is the best protection from weather extremes&#x201d;)&#x2014;as if having a few more dollars will make much difference when your city is underwater. Which is a way of looking away if you happen to be a policy wonk.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves we are too busy to care about something so distant and abstract&#x2014;even though we saw the water in the subways in New York City, and the people on their rooftops in New Orleans, and know that no one is safe, the most vulnerable least of all. And though perfectly understandable, this too is a way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves that all we can do is focus on ourselves. Meditate and shop at farmers&#x2019; markets and stop driving&#x2014;but forget trying to actually change the systems that are making the crisis inevitable because that&#x2019;s too much &#x201c;bad energy&#x201d; and it will never work. And at first it may appear as if we are looking, because many of these lifestyle changes are indeed part of the solution, but we still have one eye tightly shut.<br> <br>Or maybe we do look&#x2014;really look&#x2014;but then, inevitably, we seem to forget. Remember and then forget again. Climate change is like that; it&#x2019;s hard to keep it in your head for very long. We engage in this odd form of on-again-off-again ecological amnesia for perfectly rational reasons. We deny because we fear that letting in the full reality of this crisis will change everything. And we are right.5<br> <br>We know that if we continue on our current path of allowing emissions to rise year after year, climate change will change everything about our world. Major cities will very likely drown, ancient cultures will be swallowed by the seas, and there is a very high chance that our children will spend a great deal of their lives fleeing and recovering from vicious storms and extreme droughts. And we don&#x2019;t have to do anything to bring about this future. All we have to do is nothing. Just continue to do what we are doing now, whether it&#x2019;s counting on a techno-fix or tending to our gardens or telling ourselves we&#x2019;re unfortunately too busy to deal with it.<br> <br>All we have to do is not react as if this is a full-blown crisis. All we have to do is keep on denying how frightened we actually are. And then, bit by bit, we will have arrived at the place we most fear, the thing from which we have been averting our eyes. No additional effort required.<br> <br>There are ways of preventing this grim future, or at least making it a lot less dire. But the catch is that these also involve changing everything. For us high consumers, it involves changing how we live, how our economies function, even the stories we tell about our place on earth. The good news is that many of these changes are distinctly un-catastrophic. Many are downright exciting. But I didn&#x2019;t discover this for a long while.<br> <br>I remember the precise moment when I stopped averting my eyes to the reality of climate change, or at least when I first allowed my eyes to rest there for a good while. It was in Geneva, in April 2009, and I was meeting with Bolivia&#x2019;s ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO), who was then a surprisingly young woman named Ang�lica Navarro Llanos. Bolivia being a poor country with a small international budget, Navarro Llanos had recently taken on the climate portfolio in addition to her trade responsibilities. Over lunch in an empty Chinese restaurant, she explained to me (using chopsticks as props to make a graph of the global emission trajectory) that she saw climate change both as a terrible threat to her people&#x2014;but also an opportunity.<br> <br>A threat for the obvious reasons: Bolivia is extraordinarily dependent on glaciers for its drinking and irrigation water and those white-capped mountains that tower over its capital were turning gray and brown at an alarming rate. The opportunity, Navarro Llanos said, was that since countries like hers had done almost nothing to send emissions soaring, they were in a position to declare themselves &#x201c;climate creditors,&#x201d; owed money and technology support from the large emitters to defray the hefty costs of coping with more climate-related disasters, as well as to help them develop on a green energy path.<br> <br>She had recently given a speech at a United Nations climate conference in which she laid out the case for these kinds of wealth transfers, and she gave me a copy. &#x201c;Millions of people,&#x201d; it read, &#x201c;in small islands, least-developed countries, landlocked countries as well as vulnerable communities in Brazil, India and China, and all around the world&#x2014;are suffering from the effects of a problem to which they did not contribute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If we are to curb emissions in the next decade, we need a massive mobilization larger than any in history. We need a Marshall Plan for the Earth. This plan must mobilize financing and technology transfer on scales never seen before. It must get technology onto the ground in every country to ensure we reduce emissions while raising people&#x2019;s quality of life. We have only a decade.&#x201d;6<br> <br>Of course a Marshall Plan for the Earth would be very costly&#x2014;hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars (Navarro Llanos was reluctant to name a figure). And one might have thought that the cost alone would make it a nonstarter&#x2014;after all, this was 2009 and the global financial crisis was in full swing. Yet the grinding logic of austerity&#x2014;passing on the bankers&#x2019; bills to the people in the form of public sector layoffs, school closures, and the like&#x2014;had not yet been normalized. So rather than making Navarro Llanos&#x2019;s ideas seem less plausible, the crisis had the opposite effect.<br> <br>We had all just watched as trillions of dollars were marshaled in a moment when our elites decided to declare a crisis. If the banks were allowed to fail, we were told, the rest of the economy would collapse. It was a matter of collective survival, so the money had to be found. In the process, some rather large fictions at the heart of our economic system were exposed (Need more money? Print some!). A few years earlier, governments took a similar approach to public finances after the September 11 terrorist attacks. In many Western countries, when it came to constructing the security/surveillance state at home and waging war abroad, budgets never seemed to be an issue.<br> <br>Climate change has never received the crisis treatment from our leaders, despite the fact that it carries the risk of destroying lives on a vastly greater scale than collapsed banks or collapsed buildings. The cuts to our greenhouse gas emissions that scientists tell us are necessary in order to greatly reduce the risk of catastrophe are treated as nothing more than gentle suggestions, actions that can be put off pretty much indefinitely. Clearly, what gets declared a crisis is an expression of power and priorities as much as hard facts. But we need not be spectators in all this: politicians aren&#x2019;t the only ones with the power to declare a crisis. Mass movements of regular people can declare one too.<br> <br>Slavery wasn&#x2019;t a crisis for British and American elites until abolitionism turned it into one. Racial discrimination wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until the civil rights movement turned it into one. Sex discrimination wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until feminism turned it into one. Apartheid wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until the anti-apartheid movement turned it into one.<br> <br>In the very same way, if enough of us stop looking away and decide that climate change is a crisis worthy of Marshall Plan levels of response, then it will become one, and the political class will have to respond, both by making resources available and by bending the free market rules that have proven so pliable when elite interests are in peril. We occasionally catch glimpses of this potential when a crisis puts climate change at the front of our minds for a while. &#x201c;Money is no object in this relief effort. Whatever money is needed for it will be spent,&#x201d; declared British prime minister David Cameron&#x2014;Mr. Austerity himself&#x2014;when large parts of his country were underwater from historic flooding in February 2014 and the public was enraged that his government was not doing more to help.7<br> <br>Listening to Navarro Llanos describe Bolivia&#x2019;s perspective, I began to understand how climate change&#x2014;if treated as a true planetary emergency akin to those rising flood waters&#x2014;could become a galvanizing force for humanity, leaving us all not just safer from extreme weather, but with societies that are safer and fairer in all kinds of other ways as well. The resources required to rapidly move away from fossil fuels and prepare for the coming heavy weather could pull huge swaths of humanity out of poverty, providing services now sorely lacking, from clean water to electricity. This is a vision of the future that goes beyond just surviving or enduring climate change, beyond &#x201c;mitigating&#x201d; and &#x201c;adapting&#x201d; to it in the grim language of the United Nations. It is a vision in which we collectively use the crisis to leap somewhere that seems, frankly, better than where we are right now.<br> <br>After that conversation, I found that I no longer feared immersing myself in the scientific reality of the climate threat. I stopped avoiding the articles and the scientific studies and read everything I could find. I also stopped outsourcing the problem to the environmentalists, stopped telling myself this was somebody else&#x2019;s issue, somebody else&#x2019;s job. And through conversations with others in the growing climate justice movement, I began to see all kinds of ways that climate change could become a catalyzing force for positive change&#x2014;how it could be the best argument progressi...</p><h2>The Trinity: Evidence And Issues</h2><p>Unintimidated by the tide of human thought in contemporary philosophy, ethics, and even liberal theology, Dr. Robert Morey builds a theoretically sound, intellectually compelling, and biblically based case for the Trinity within the context of those issues that will dominate Twenty-first century thought.</p><p></p><h2>Man&#39;s Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy</h2><p>The author is the leader and originator of the school of logotherapy or existential analysis.

The war that followed would decide the fate of the entire North American continent&#x2014;not just between Great Britain and France, but for the Spanish and Native Americans as well.</p><p>Fought across virgin wilderness, from Nova Scotia to the forks of the Ohio River, the French and Indian War is best remembered for dogged frontier campaigns to capture such strategic linchpins as Forts Ticonderoga, Duquesne, and Niagara; legendary treks by Rogers' Rangers; and the momentous battle of Quebec on the Plains of Abraham. Here are the stories of Jeffery Amherst, the loyal soldier who did his king's bidding at the expense of his home and family; the marquis de Montcalm, Canada's champion who had to fight his own governor as well as the British; and William Pitt, the man who brashly proclaimed that only he could save England. We also encounter George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, William Shirley, Edward Braddock, and, of course, Major Robert Rogers, a legend misunderstood who stands both revered and damned.</p><p>Against the backdrop of Fortress Louisbourg in Nova Scotia, the forests surrounding Lake George in upstate New York, the Caribbean, and the fall of Quebec, Borneman poses interesting what-if questions, examining controversies that continue to this day: Did the dashing Brigadier General James Wolfe frantically wave his hat to signal retreat or to urge his troops onward to victory? What if Spain had come to the aid of France sooner? What if the affable Lord Howe had lived?</p><p><em>The French and Indian War: Deciding the Fate of North America</em> presents the triumphs and tragedies of this epic struggle for a continent, placing them in the larger context of France and Great Britain's global conflict&#x2014;what Samuel Eliot Morison called truly the first world war&#x2014;and emphasizes that the seeds of discord sown in its aftermath would give root to the American Revolution.</p></p><p><p>Walter R. Borneman is the author of <em>Alaska: Saga of a Bold Land</em>, <em>1812: The War That Forged a Nation</em>, and several books on the history of the western United States. He lives in Colorado.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Borneman offers an excellent general-audience version of Fred Anderson's <i>Crucible of War</i> (2000), the definitive academic history of the mid&#x2013;18th-century French and Indian War and its long-term consequences for America and the world. Drawing on a broad spectrum of primary and secondary sources, Borneman (<i>1812: The War That Forged a Nation</i>) argues that the French and Indian War not only made Britain master of North America but created an empire that dominated the world for two centuries. What began in the Ohio Valley in 1755 as the local defeat of a small force under Gen. Edwin Braddock escalated into what legitimately merits designation as the First World War. Borneman connects that complex conflict in North America with events in the Caribbean, Europe and Asia. Although the Native Americans were "the real losers" in the war for their continent, they offered formidable resistance to a developing European hegemony. But the English colonials' discomfiture overshadowed Native Americans', as the settlers were expected to help finance the war but were denied its fruits by being forbidden to claim land west of the Appalachians.

In <i>When the Facts Change</i>, Tony Judt&#x2019;s widow and fellow historian Jennifer Homans has assembled an essential collection of the most important and influential pieces written in the last fifteen years of Judt&#x2019;s life, the years in which he found his voice in the public sphere. Included are seminal essays on the full range of Judt&#x2019;s concerns, including Europe as an idea and in reality, before 1989 and thereafter; Israel, the Holocaust and the Jews; American hyperpower and the world after 9/11; and issues of social inclusion and social justice in an age of increasing inequality.&nbsp;<br><br>Judt was at once most at home and in a state of what he called internal exile from his native England, from Europe, and from America, and he finally settled in New York&#x2014;between them all. He was a historian of the twentieth century acutely aware of the dangers of ethnic exceptionalism, and if he was shaped by anything, it was the Jewish past and his own secularism. His essays on Israel ignited a firestorm debate for their forthright criticisms of Israeli government polices relating to the Palestinians and the occupied territories. Those crucial pieces are published here in book form for the first time, including an essay, never previously published, called &#x201c;What Is to Be Done?&#x201d;&nbsp; These pieces are suffused with a deep compassion for the Israeli dilemma, a compassion that instilled in Judt a sense of responsibility to speak out and try to find a better path, away from what he saw as a road to ruin.<br><br><i>When the Facts Change</i> also contains Judt&#x2019;s homages to the culture heroes who were some of his greatest inspirations: Amos Elon, Fran�ois Furet, Leszek Kolakowski, and perhaps above all Albert Camus, who never accepted the complacent view that the problem of evil couldn't lie within us as well as outside us. Included here too is a magnificent two-part essay on the social and political importance of railway travel to our modern conception of a good society; as well as the urgent text of &#x201c;What Is Living and What Is Dead in Social Democracy,&#x201d; the final public speech of his life, delivered from a wheelchair after he had been stricken with a terrible illness; and a tender and wise dialogue with his then-teenage son, Daniel, about the different outlooks and burdens of their two generations.<br><br>To read <i>When the Facts Change</i> is to miss Tony Judt&#x2019;s voice terribly, but to cherish it for what it was, and still is: a wise, human, deeply informed view on our most pressing concerns, delivered in good faith.</p><p><b>Tony Judt</b>&nbsp;was educated at King&#x2019;s College,&nbsp;Cambridge, and l&#x2019;�cole Normale Sup�rieure, Paris, and&nbsp;taught at Cambridge, Oxford, and Berkeley.

Otherwise, I get pulled back into the man, who I loved and was married to from 1993 until his death in 2010, rather than forward into the ideas. As you read these essays, I hope that you, too, will focus on the ideas, because they are good ideas, and they were written in good faith. &#x201c;In good faith&#x201d; may have been Tony&#x2019;s favorite phrase and highest standard, and he held himself to it in everything he wrote. What he meant by it, I think, was writing that is free of calculation and maneuver, intellectual or otherwise. A clean, clear, honest account.</p><p>This is a book about our age. The arc is down: from the heights of hope and possibility, with the revolutions of 1989, into the confusion, devastation, and loss of 9/11, the Iraq war, the deepening crisis in the Middle East, and&#x2014;as Tony saw it&#x2014;the self-defeating decline of the American republic. As the facts changed and events unfolded, Tony found himself turned increasingly and unhappily against the current, fighting with all of his intellectual might to turn the ship of ideas, however slightly, in a different direction. The story ends abruptly, with his untimely death.</p><p>This book is also, for me, a very personal book, since &#x201c;our age&#x201d; was also &#x201c;my age&#x201d; with Tony: the early essays date to the first years of our marriage and the birth of our son Daniel, and follow through our time together in Vienna, Paris, New York, the birth of Nicholas, and the growing up of our family. Our life together began, not coincidentally, with the fall of Communism in 1989: I was a graduate student at New York University, where Tony taught. In the summer of 1991, I traveled across Central Europe, and when I got back I wanted to know more. I was advised to take an independent study with Tony Judt.</p><p>I did, and our romance began, over books and conversations about European politics, war, revolution, justice, art. It wasn&#x2019;t the usual dating arrangement: our second &#x201c;course meeting&#x201d; took place in a restaurant over dinner. Tony pushed the books aside, ordered wine, and told me of his time in Prague under Communism, and then in 1989, walking through silent snow-covered squares and streets deep into the night soon after the Velvet Revolution, clearly in awe at the turn of historical fate&#x2014;and the feelings that were already apparent between us. We watched movies, went to art exhibitions, ate Chinese food, he even cooked (badly). Finally&#x2014;the key to our courtship&#x2014;he invited me on a trip to Europe: Paris, Vienna, Budapest, a hair-raising drive over the Simplon Pass in a storm (I drove&#x2014;he had migraines). We took trains, and I watched him pouring over timetables, clocking departures and arrivals like a kid in a candy store: Zermatt, Brig, Florence, Venice.</p><p>It was a great romance, and it was a European romance, part of a larger romance with Europe that defined Tony&#x2019;s life, and his life&#x2019;s work. At times, I think he even thought of himself as European. But he wasn&#x2019;t really. Sure, he spoke French, German, Italian, Hebrew, Czech, some Spanish, but he was never &#x201c;at home&#x201d; in any of these places. He was more <i>Central</i> European, but not exactly that either&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t quite have that history, except by professional engagement and family roots (Russian, Polish, Romanian, and Lithuanian Jews). He was very English, too, by habit and upbringing (he could move effortlessly between his childhood cockney and confident Oxbridge prose), but he wasn&#x2019;t really that either&#x2014;too Jewish, too Central European. It&#x2019;s not that he was alienated from any of these places, although in some cases he was; it was more that he was attached to bits of all of them, which is why he couldn&#x2019;t let go of any of them.</p><p>So perhaps it is not surprising that although we settled in New York from the start, we spent much of our life together planning to live&#x2014;or living&#x2014;somewhere else. We were expert packers and often joked that we would write a book together called something like &#x201c;At Home in Europe: Everything You Need to Know about Schools and Real Estate.&#x201d; By far the best gift I ever gave to Tony was a subscription to Thomas Cooks Railway Timetable.</p><p>It was only after 2001 that he really settled. This was partly because of his health: that year he was diagnosed with a serious cancer and underwent major surgery, radiation, and other draining therapies. Partly, too, because of the WTC attack. It became increasingly difficult to travel, and the horror of the event itself, combined with his illness, had a homing effect; he wanted to be here with me and the boys. Whatever the reasons, in the years that followed he slowly became more and more, though never quite, American&#x2014;ironically at the very moment when he found greatest reasons to be critical of its politics. He acquired citizenship: &#x201c;Quiz me,&#x201d; he would say to the kids in the weeks before the test, and they would gleefully take him through the paces, no matter that he had taught American politics for years at Oxford. Around 2003 I noticed a shift in his thinking, and in his writing, from &#x201c;them&#x201d; to &#x201c;us&#x201d;: &#x201c;The Way <i>We</i> Live Now.&#x201d;</p><p>These were also the years of the Remarque Institute, which Tony founded in 1995 and directed until his death. It was built along the same two axes that preoccupied him in his writing: bringing together Europe and America, history and contemporary politics. At the same time, he was writing <i>Postwar </i>(2005), a mammoth undertaking, which tested daily his physical and intellectual strength and discipline, especially as he recovered from cancer. I remember well his exhaustion and determination as he insisted on writing the essays in this volume, too, even as he was (as he put it) &#x201c;in the coal mines&#x201d; of a major book about Europe. I worried at how hard he pushed himself, but in retrospect I see that he couldn&#x2019;t help it. As he immersed himself in <i>Postwar</i>, he was hearing canaries in the mines of our own time: these essays, which beg us&#x2014;and especially &#x201c;us&#x201d; Americans&#x2014;to look back on the twentieth century as we make our way in the twenty-first, were one result.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>SO THIS IS A COLLECTION of essays, but it is also a collection of obsessions. Tony&#x2019;s obsessions. They are all here: Europe and America, Israel and the Middle East, justice, the public sphere, the state, international relations, memory and forgetting, and above all history. His caution, which reappears across these essays, that we were witnessing an &#x201c;economic age&#x201d; collapse into an &#x201c;era of fear&#x201d;* and entering &#x201c;a new age of insecurity&#x201d;* was a sign of just how depressed and worried he was at the direction politics was taking. He expected a lot and was a keen observer. You will find in these essays, I think, both a clear-eyed realist&#x2014;who believed in facts, events, data&#x2014;and an idealist who aimed at nothing less than the well-lived life; not just for himself, but for society.</p><p>I have presented the essays chronologically as well as thematically because chronology was one of his greatest obsessions. He was, after all, a historian, and he had little patience for postmodern fashions of textual fragmentation or narrative disruption, especially in historical writing. He wasn&#x2019;t really interested in the idea that there is no single truth (wasn&#x2019;t that obvious?), or the deconstruction of this or that text. The real job, he believed, was not to say what <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> but what <i>was</i>&#x2014;to tell a convincing and clearly written story from the available evidence, and to do it with an eye to what is right and just. Chronology was not merely a professional or literary convention, it was a prerequisite&#x2014;even, when it came to history, a moral responsibility.</p><p>A word about facts: I have never met anyone as committed to facts as Tony, something his children learned from the start: it is to Daniel, now nineteen, that we owe the title of this volume, which comes from a (probably apocryphal) quote from Keynes that was one of Tony&#x2019;s favorite mantras: &#x201c;when the facts change, I change my mind&#x2014;what do you do, sir?&#x201d; I learned this early on about Tony, in one of those domestic situations that does so much to illuminate a man. When we were first married we bought a house in Princeton, New Jersey (his idea)&#x2014;but it was more of a house in theory than in practice. In theory, Tony wanted to live there, but in practice we were living in New York, or traveling to Europe, or on our way somewhere else. Eventually, I wanted to sell the house&#x2014;it was draining us financially and frankly I had a horror of ever living there. There ensued a long and difficult discussion about what to do with the house, which turned into a debate and finally a silent and angry standoff about the emotional, historical, geographical meaning of houses and home, and why this particular one was or wasn&#x2019;t right for us.</p><p>Arguing with Tony was a real challenge because he was a master at the dialectical switchback and could turn any point you made against you. Finally I created a spreadsheet that laid out the facts&#x2014;a desperate strategic move on my part: finances, commuter train schedules, fares, total hours spent at Penn Station, the works. He studied it carefully and agreed on the spot to sell the house. No regrets, no remorse, no recriminations, no further discussion necessary. He was already on to the next plan. To me, it was an astounding and admirable quality. It gave him a kind of clarity of thinking&#x2014;he wasn&#x2019;t wedded to his ideas or, as I later discovered, to his prose. When the facts changed&#x2014;when a better, more convincing argument was made&#x2014;he really did change his mind and move on.</p><p>He had great inner certainty. This was not an existential attribute, it was hard earned: he read, ingested, absorbed, memorized more facts, and knew more &#x201c;real stuff,&#x201d; as he liked to put it, than anyone I have ever met. For this reason, he didn&#x2019;t like social events or parties: he was shy, in a way, and preferred to stay home and read&#x2014;he could get more from books, he said, away from the distracting &#x201c;blah blah&#x201d; of the &#x201c;chattering classes.&#x201d; He was almost machinelike in his recall, and he arrived at his positions quickly and decisively, sifting a given problem through his extraordinary store of knowledge and sharply analytic mind. It is not that he trusted himself absolutely&#x2014;like all of us, he had emotional gaps and moments when reason and good judgment deserted him, but these were mostly in his life, not in his writing. When it came to ideas, he was not a doubter; he had a kind of pure intellectual command and ability to summon ideas and arguments without complication.</p><p>He was a great writer because he was always fine-tuning his words, craftsmanlike, to this inner pitch. He had a system for writing, and the essays in this book were all written according to the same method, even those from 2008 to 2010 when he was ill and quadriplegic. First, he read everything he could on a subject, taking copious notes by hand, on lined yellow legal pads. Then came the outline, color-coded A, B, C, D, with detailed subcategories: A1 i, A1 ii, A2 iii, etc. (more legal pads). Then he sat for hours on end, monklike, at the dining room table assigning each line in his notes, each fact, date, point, or idea, to a place in the outline. Next&#x2014;and this was the killer and the key&#x2014;he retranscribed <i>all </i>of his original notes in the order of the outline. By the time he sat down to write the essay, he had copied, recopied, and memorized most of what he needed to know. Then, door closed, eight-hour days of writing back to back until the piece was done (small breaks for marmite sandwiches and strong espresso). Finally&#x2014;&#x201c;polishing.&#x201d;</p><p>When he became ill, none of this changed, it just got harder. Someone else had to be the hands, turning the pages of books, assembling materials, searching the Web, and typing. As his body failed, he retaught himself how to think and write&#x2014;the most private of events&#x2014;with someone else, a tribute to the flexibility of his extraordinary mind. He worked with an assistant, but he had to do most of the work by memory, in his own mind, usually at night, composing, sorting, cataloguing, rewriting his mental notes according to his outline&#x2014;A, B, C, D&#x2014;to be typed in the morning by me, our boys, a nurse, or his assistant.</p><p>This was not just a method, I think, it was a map of his mind. The logic, the patience, the intense concentration and careful construction of the argument, the soldierly attention to fact and detail, the confidence of his convictions&#x2014;unlike most writers, he rarely deviated from his original design. The difficulty came when he bumped into things inside himself that he didn&#x2019;t fully see or know: not the &#x201c;facts on the ground,&#x201d; but the &#x201c;facts inside&#x201d;&#x2014;the things that were just there, like furniture in his mind. The most obvious had to do with being Jewish.</p><p>For Tony, being Jewish was a given&#x2014;the oldest piece of furniture in the place. It was the only identity that he possessed unequivocally. He was not religious, never went to synagogue, never practiced anything at home; he liked to quote Isaac Deutscher (whose books were given to him by his father, Joe, when he was a boy) on the &#x201c;non-Jewish Jews.&#x201d; If he talked about being Jewish, it was about the past: Friday night dinners as a child with his Yiddish-speaking grandparents in the East End of London; his father&#x2019;s (very Jewish) secular humanism (&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in race, I believe in humanity&#x201d;) and his mother&#x2019;s determined renunciation&#x2014;she stood in her living room when the Queen of England appeared on TV and didn&#x2019;t want <i>her</i> grandchildren circumcised lest &#x201c;bad times&#x201d; come again; or his grandfather Enoch, the proverbial wandering Jew, who always had his bags packed and spent as much of his life as he could on the road.</p><p>Another fact: the hat. Some years ago, we were on our way to the bat mitzvah of a close friend&#x2019;s daughter at a synagogue on New York&#x2019;s Upper East Side. We were late and almost there in a taxi traveling uptown, when Tony literally panicked: he had forgotten his hat. Did it really matter, I asked, we were late already and he would miss part of the service if he went back. Couldn&#x2019;t he go without it? No, really he couldn&#x2019;t, and I was taken aback at the heightened and inexplicable anxiety that seemed to overtake him. He went back for the hat, which was a well-appointed but old-fashioned thing I couldn&#x2019;t remember having ever seen before. When he slipped into the synagogue to rejoin me, he was astonished to find that he was the only one: the other guests were all wearing black-tie. He was indignant and a bit offended, but mostly confused&#x2014;and manifestly out of place. What kind of Jews were these?</p><p>Tony had had a bar mitzvah himself (&#x201c;we did our duty,&#x201d; his father later explained), and as a passionate (later disabused) Zionist in his youth, he spoke good Hebrew and had been a translator in Israel during the 1967 war. When our boys were young we agreed that we would like them to have at least some religious education. My background was Protestant but above all atheist, so we soon dismissed the idea of Sunday school and instead found Itay&#x2014;a graduate student at the Jewish Theological Seminary, who came to our apartment on Washington Square weekly to teach the boys Hebrew, biblical history, culture. There was&#x2014;Tony&#x2019;s decision&#x2014;no bar mitzvah. To my mind, the message was clear: within th...</p></p><h2>A Branch from the Lightning Tree: Ecstatic Myth and the Grace of Wildness</h2><p>Martin Shaw's writing rattles the cages of souls. In <i>A Branch from the Lightning Tree,</i> Shaw creates links between the wildness in landscape and language, with myth being the bridge between the two. Shaw uses four great myths from Welsh, Norwegian, Siberian, and Russian territories that explore the process of leaving what is considered safe and predictable and journeying out into wild, uncertain areas of nature and the psyche. Shaw's work focuses on both men and women&#x2019;s movement into wildness as part of the bigger awareness of climate change and ecology. It presents the old stories as keys into any debate on these issues, showing how the ability to think metaphorically and mythologically "re-enchants" our perspectives.</p><p>Martin Shaw is a mythologist, storyteller, and wilderness rites-of-passage guide based in Devonshire, England. Shaw gave up a lucrative music contract to pursue the study of myth while living for four years in a tent in the wilderness of Wales. An international teacher, he tours the United States and Canada annually and is visiting lecturer on Archbishop Desmond Tutu&#39;s Leadership program at Oxford University.<p>A true master. Martin Shaw is one of the very greatest storytellers we have. Shaw presides over an astonishing flow of language. His prose reaches up into the high old areas Joseph Campbell used to do his arm wrestling in, and many of Shaw's leaps are absolutely superb. He is talking about experiencing ancient myths in a new way and he does it elegantly. He encourages the teeth of professors to fall out and the teeth of the young to grow. <strong> Robert Bly, author of <em>Iron John</em> and winner of the National Book Award</strong></p><p>Eloquent and elegant, Shaw offers an irresistible invitation to 'dive down the rabbit hole' into realms that hold the wisdom of, not only survival, but expanding into one's sense of purpose, maturing into the gift of service to the collective. <strong> Malidoma P. Som�, teacher and author of <em>Ritual: Power, Healing &amp; Community</em></strong></p><p>This is an astonishing book - part memoir, part retelling of old tales, and part courageous delving into the psyche's trek from the "civilized" out into the "wild." Shaw's inspired writing and, as he says, "wild thinking," come from both inner and outer experiences, from the wealth and daring that a wilderness teacher and storyteller must have. When I finished reading it, I felt I had been given a gift. <strong> Gioia Timpanelli, storyteller and Women's National Book Association Award winning author of <em>What Makes A Child Lucky</em></strong></p><p>Shaw is a writer of rare and fierce beauty, and a great enemy of mediocrity, wherever it may hide. <em><strong>A Branch From the Lightning Tree </strong></em>is an oceanic dive into the mythic fire-on myths own terms. The whole book conjures a tale of who we are and where we might be going. <strong> Daniel Deardorff, author of <em>The Other Within: The Genius of Deformity in Myth, Culture, and Psyche</em></strong></p><p>This is visceral and imaginative writing. Shaw creates links between the wildness in language and landscape, myth being a bridge between the two. As a book it both nourishes and inspires, superbly placing story in the centre of the challenges of ecology, leadership and climate change. He writes with a poetic flair that gives the book mystery, fire and purpose. This needs to be read! <strong> Rosie Boycott, author, former editor of <em>The Independent</em> and Chair of the 2008 Samuel Johnson award for nonfiction</strong></p><p>Shaw has so much knowledge and wisdom about the old stories it emanates from his pores. He knows about the mythic trap of 'eternal youth' that is the shadow of rock'n'roll. He knows why Jim Morrison went down. His prose is voracious -- it will gobble up the reader's psyche and challenge it to change. <strong> John Densmore, essayist, best selling author, and founding member of The Doors.</strong></p></p><h2>The Pagan Lord (The Last Kingdom Series, Book 7) (The Last Kingdom Series)</h2><p>The Pagan Lord</p><p><p>In a clash of heroes, the kingdom is born.</p><p>At the onset of the tenth century, England is in turmoil.

Why a Strong Woman Wins His Heart </b> <p> </p><p> </p><p> <i></i></p><blockquote><i> Let us now set forth one of the fundamental truths about marriage: the wife is in charge.<p> Bill Cosby </p></i></blockquote> <p> <b>Society's Guidelines for Good Girls</b> </p><p> Imagine a world in which roles were reversed and men cooked for women, picked up socks, and couldn't wait to get married. Pretend you had a boyfriend who owned a hope chest with six lavender bow ties inside that he wanted his groomsmen to wear at the wedding. Picture him getting choked up every time you strolled past a Baby Gap. And that he greeted you at the door wearing silk boxers and cowboy boots, so he could do a pole dance for you. Then add a few ultimatums: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p> "Where's my ring?<p> "Why won't you marry me?" </p> <p> </p><p> </p><p> Chances are, you would assume the guy wasn't firing on all cylinders. And then you'd start planning your escape. "It's not you, it's me. [Translation: It's definitely you.] I'm too busy with work. I love you but I'm not in love with you." Then you'd blow out the door...like TNT. </p><p> As scary as it sounds, this is precisely the approach women are taught on how to catch a husband. It's the plight of every "nice girl" who puts everyone else first, puts her own needs last, and doesn't think she is worthy of touching the hemline of her man's pants. </p><p> When I polled men, they all said <i>confident women are in very short supply.</i> And that a confident woman is what they find sexiest. Is it any wonder that confident women are hard to come by? Look around. The average fashion magazine tells women to act like a servant, as if dating were a labor-intensive, blue-collar-job application: "Can you serve a cold beer in trashy lingerie? Do you leave razor-sharp creases in his shirts like employee-of-the-month at the Jolly Roger motel? Do you wear cellophane for him? Are you gardening in stilettos? Are you giving it up doggie-style? If so, he'll drop to one knee and propose..." </p><p> What women are learning from all of this is how to behave desperately. When her attitude is "Pick me! Pick me!" she hits the kill switch on his desire. It's human nature. You'd be just as turned off by a guy who brought two dozen roses to a first coffee date and told you he felt like the luckiest SOB on the planet in the first five minutes. </p><p> It's human nature. Telling a woman to work harder to please is like telling a little kid to walk up to a schoolyard bully on the first day of school and say, "Here, take my lunch money. And you can have my cupcakes too. I'll even throw in my lunchbox since you don't have one." Or, in a dating situation, "Here, take my body. And I made you a cake. Please be nice. Please marry me. I'll even jack my butt up nice and high like they do in yoga. It's so comfortable being upside down. <i>Really.</i> I just love it!" </p><p> Just because a man sleeps with you doesn't mean he's thinking about the future. For him to think about forever, there has to be something he respects <i>within</i> you. Like a strong wit...and a strong mind. </p><p> </p> <b>Relationship Principle 1</b><p><b> In romance, there's nothing more attractive to a man than a woman who has dignity and pride in who she is.</b> </p> <p> In addition, you have to know your own mind. The more you focus on elevating yourself, the more he will work to be at the top of your priority list. He considers you a long-term prospect when you've added the key ingredient: <i>respect.</i> And respect is the glue that holds everything together. </p><p> Kara is a perfect example of why smart, confident women come out on top. Very early on, her fianc� tried to give her his two cents on how she should dress. She was leaving for a meeting, and he told her to wear a dress instead of the pantsuit she had on. Then he told her she was wearing too much makeup. What the nice girl would have done is run out and buy a new wardrobe. But Kara playfully put him in check: "Listen here, Versace. This outfit has always been fine. And I haven't had any complaints about the makeup either. But if you'd like, I'll let you know when I'm wearing this in advance. That way, if you don't want to see me in it, you don't have to come over." </p><p> In order to be looked at differently, you have to <i>think</i> differently. He has to see that you call your own shots and that you don't need input from anyone about how to put your socks on. This says, "I am secure." The biggest attraction killer is neediness and insecurity. The bitch doesn't audition or try to be the "best in show." Instead of "where's my ring" or "why won't you marry me," she's thinking: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p> "What's the advantage of having this guy around?"<p> "How do I feel about myself after I've been in his company?"</p><p> "What's in it for me?" </p> <p> </p><p> </p><p> And then a funny thing happens: <i>He falls all over himself to be with her.</i> </p><p> Kim Basinger said something interesting: "I don't have time to be classified as difficult, and I don't have time to care." Men tend to feel at ease with a woman who doesn't care so much because then he doesn't have to be fully responsible for someone else's happiness. When a man sees you are happy with him <i>but you can be just as happy having nothing to do with him,</i> that's when he won't want to leave your side. <i>When you are happy, you are sexy. </i> </p><p> Not only this, bitches have more fun. My friend Angela had a date with a guy on a Friday and they went out for Chinese food. They tried several dishes and had plenty of leftovers, so Angela took home all the doggie bags. The following evening, she had date with a different guy and decided to be the "hostess with the mostest." She reheated the Chinese leftovers, "reorganized" a medley on a pretty plate, and served it to her guest of honor. The fortune cookie said: "The catered din-din was a smashing success." </p><p> Of course, I would never recommend that you choose such a quick and easy meal over three hours of sweating and slaving in the kitchen. However, I would be remiss if I did not include this one expert gourmet cooking tip: Don't keep the parsley. (If it gets soggy in the microwave it will be a dead giveaway every time.) </p><p> Notice what Kara and Angela had in common: Neither one of them felt the need to overcompensate. This earned the man's respect. Why? It was expected that they knock themselves out because the rulebook says women are supposed to. When they refused, a light bulb went off over his head. The message "I am worth something" <i>is what turns him into a believer.</i> </p><p> In a music-channel documentary, Tim McGraw said something very intriguing about his wife, Faith Hill: "She's a straight shooter, that's for sure. She doesn't take any sh*t from anybody." He didn't choose to comment on her talent, success, beauty, fame, or any of the other things society celebrates. Instead, he commented on the attribute men respect most: a backbone. Do you think he's proud that his wife doesn't take B.S. lying down? I'd bet that he is. </p><p> </p> <b>Relationship Principle 2</b><p><b> He marries the woman who <i>won't</i> lay down like linoleum.</b> </p> <p> This brings us to the definition of a marrying bitch -- aka a strong, spirited woman who can stand up for herself. The bitch is not rude or abrasive because she's smart enough to know that being considerate is more effective. But she won't compromise herself to be in a relationship. She won't work overtime to "catch a husband." Because of this, he doesn't classify her as a mindless woman he can take advantage of. She has a certain moxie about her. Sugar and spice...and <i>not</i> always so nice -- <i>that's what his dreams are made of.</i> </p><p> Since many "nice" women mistakenly believe that being a strong woman (aka a bitch) is a bad thing, let's explore some of the criteria of the so-called eligible woman. Then we'll find out from men what they <i>really</i> think about women who behave this way. </p><p> <b>Myth 1: You Have to Be Perfect</b> </p><p> Think about the last time you were madly in love. Chances are, the guy wasn't a millionaire or a brain surgeon with six-pack abs who was hung like a barnyard animal on Viagra. Chances are, he didn't get you off five times before he got his. But there was something special about him. He had a couple of features that did it for you and a certain magic that made you tingle. Men who want to fit in a relationship are looking for that same magic. </p><p> <b></b></p><b> Relationship Principle 3<p> He doesn't marry a woman who is perfect. He marries the woman who is <i>interesting.</i> </p></b> <p> This is one of the biggest myths perpetuated by the media: If you are perfect, beautiful, and rich, you will get the respect and love you crave. So they say. (And now back to reality.) When a man meets a woman who seems <i>too</i> perfect, <i>too</i> sweet, or <i>too</i> agreeable, he tends to become bored very quickly. </p><p> Beauty pageants are a good example of how women are misled into thinking that the most important pursuits in life are beauty tips and "man catching" skills. Granted, they offer educational grants and scholarships, which is very ironic because the only men watching are the ones who like really stupid women. Intelligent men think it's embarrassing for a woman to pose and smile like she's always that chipper. Everybody knows the losers want to strangle the winner, and the Southern Belle who wins Miss Congeniality is dying to tell the judges: "Fuck all, y'all...you ugly summabitches."

This exciting body-mind approach to personality has a liberating and positive effect on emotional, physical, and psychic distress. Dr. Alexander Lowen, founder and prime mover of this fast-growing therapy, writes that increased joy and pleasure are possible in every day life through an understanding of how your body functions energetically: how it determines what you feel, think, and do. Dr. Lowen points out that lack of energy is the result of chronic muscular tensions, a condition caused by the suppression of feelings. These tensions can be dissolved through the direct body work in bioenergetic exercise, which restores the potential for living a rich, full life. Dr. Lowen analyzes common physical ailments like headaches and lower back pain and shows how they too can be overcome by releasing the muscular tension that create them. Generously illustrated with line drawings of bioenergetic exercises, this book is sure to bring freedom, confidence, and pleasure to thousands of men and women.</p><p>Biogenergetics is a dynamic form of therapy based on the teachings of Wilhelm Reith. It links physical pain, muscle tension, and postural disorders with state of mind, demonstrating that suppressed emotions, unhappiness, and anger can block energy flow and cause physical distress. &#39;In this highly interesting and valuable attempt to restore the body to the mind, Dr. Alexander Lowen sets out in a practically useful way the principles of his new form of psychotherapy. Bioenergetics is destined to become widely influential.&#39;<b>Dr. Alexander Lowen</b> is the creator of bioenergetics, which he has defined as "a therapeutic technique to help a person get back together with his body and to help him enjoy to the fullest degree possible the life of the body." Incorporating direct work on the body into the psychoanalytic process, Dr. Lowen practices psychiatry in New York and Connecticut and is the executive director of the Institute of Bioenergetic Analysis. He is married and lives in New Canaan, Connecticut, with his wife and son.</p><h2>Thanksgiving: A Time to Remember</h2><p>Begin a new Thanksgiving tradition with this dramatic audio presentation of the Pilgrim's exciting Thanksgiving adventures!

Her numerous books include <em>Starting Your Marriage Right </em>and<em>&nbsp;A Mother's Legacy</em>. She is a mother and grandmother and lives in Little Rock, Arkansas with her husband.&nbsp;</p>Rainey writes that for her family, "Thanksgiving was not going to be just eating, hours of TV football, naps and leftover turkey sandwiches-followed by a stress-filled Friday of frantic Christmas shopping at the mall." Instead, she seeks to educate her children-and others, through this book-about the heritage of faith and freedom that is celebrated in the national holiday of Thanksgiving. The book revisits the schoolchild version of the Pilgrims' first festival of plenty, and is meant to be read aloud by families on Thanksgiving Day (preferably before small stomachs start to grumble). The history is romantic and full of implausibly brave, righteous, magnanimous Pilgrims. There are small factual errors, as when Rainey claims that the Pilgrims observed the Sabbath in accordance with the ninth commandment instead of the fourth.

Judas.</p><p>No one has ever sacrificed anything for God. &nbsp;If you always get back more than you gave up, have you sacrificed anything at all? &nbsp;The eternal reward always outweighs the temporal sacrifice.&nbsp; At the end of the day, our greatest regret will be whatever we didn&#x2019;t give back to God. What we didn&#x2019;t push back across the table to Him.&nbsp; Eternity will reveal that holding out is losing out.</p><p>The message of <em>All In</em> is simple: <em>if Jesus is not Lord of all </em>then <em>Jesus is not Lord at all</em>.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s all or nothing. It&#x2019;s now or never. &nbsp; Kneeling at the foot of cross of Christ and surrendering to His Lordship is a radical act of dethroning yourself and enthroning Christ as King.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s also an act of disowning yourself. &nbsp;Nothing belongs to you.

One church with seven campuses, NCC also owns and operates Ebenezers Coffeehouse, the Miracle Theatre, and the DC Dream Center. Mark holds a Doctor of Ministry degree from Regent University. He and his wife Lora, have three children and live on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>While leading a growing ministry on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., the author (The Circle Maker) preaches and teaches about the committed life of faith. He sees the Christian life as playing offense in the community, living each day with integrity and hope that the world can be changed. Success is spelled stewardship, and stewardship is spelled success, he writes. Taking examples from his congregation, National Community Church, Batterson examines the faith journeys of lay people who have been able to make a difference in an inner-city church. Using the scriptures, he makes a convincing argument that Christians need to move from beyond the pew to put faith in action. According to the author, good works are the fruit of a strong belief system. The tough decision about putting faith into action is one that each person in the community needs to make. This is an exciting text for the Christian reader and should appeal to those who need a boost in their faith. Agent: Esther Fedorkevich, Fedd Agency.

But what we sometimes fail to recognize is that although Jesus Christ offered a message of forgiveness, He also spoke challenging, demanding words about what being a follower of Christ requires.</p><p>In contrast to the superficiality of much modern Christian teaching, Dr. John MacArthur serves up the unvarnished truth of what Christ taught and lived. In simple, compelling terms, he spells out what is required of those who would follow Him. Going beyond Jesus' life to include the crucifixion and resurrection, MacArthur shows readers that Jesus modeled the commitment and loving obedience He requires of us by making the ultimate sacrifice for humankind.</p></p><p>JOHN F.

If they want bigger burgers, make their burgers bigger. Designer bottled water in six fruit flavors? Done. Minivans with ten cup holders? Give them twenty. You&#x2019;ve got to keep the customer satisfied. You&#x2019;ve got to modify your product and your message to meet their needs if you want to build a market and get ahead of the competition.</p> <p> Today this same consumer mind-set has invaded Christianity. The church service is too long, you say? We&#x2019;ll shorten it (one pastor guarantees his sermons will never last more than seven minutes!). Too formal? Wear your sweatsuit. Too boring? Wait&#x2019;ll you hear our band!</p> <p> And if the message is too confrontational, or too judgmental, or too exclusive, scary, unbelievable, hard to understand, or too much anything else for your taste, churches everywhere are eager to adjust that message to make you more comfortable. This new version of Christianity makes you a partner on the team, a design consultant on church life, and does away with old-fashioned authority, guilt trips, accountability, and moral absolutes. </p> <p> One suburban church sent out a mailer recently, promising an &#x201c;informal, relaxed, casual atmosphere,&#x201d; &#x201c;great music from our band,&#x201d; and that those who come will, &#x201c;believe it or not, even have fun.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s all great if you&#x2019;re a coffee house. But anyone who claims to be calling people to the gospel of Jesus with those as his priorities is calling them to a lie. </p> <p> It&#x2019;s Christianity for consumers: Christianity Lite, the redirection, watering down, and misinterpretation of the biblical gospel in an attempt to make it more palatable and popular. It tastes great going down and settles light. It seems to salve your feelings and scratch your itch; it&#x2019;s custom tailored to your preferences. But that lightness will never fill you up with the true, saving gospel of Jesus Christ, because it is designed by man and not God, and it is hollow and worthless. In fact, it&#x2019;s worse than worthless, because people who hear the message of Christianity Lite think they&#x2019;re hearing the gospel&#x2014;think they&#x2019;re being rescued from eternal judgment&#x2014;when, in fact, they&#x2019;re being tragically misled. </p> <p><b>The False Gospel of Self-Esteem</b></p> <p> The true gospel is a call to self-denial. It is not a call to self-fulfillment. And that puts it in opposition to the contemporary evangelical gospel, where ministers view Jesus as a utilitarian genie. You rub the lamp, and He jumps out and says you have whatever you want; you give Him your list and He delivers. </p> <p> Defending the true gospel has put me in pretty serious opposition to folks who don&#x2019;t want to take the Bible seriously. I always say that the people I pastor at Grace Church must have a heart to submit to the Word of God, because that&#x2019;s the message they&#x2019;re going to get, unadorned and unadulterated, every time they walk through the door. If they&#x2019;re not willing to face the hard truth of conviction over their sins, the hard disturbing reality of self-denial and the hard demands of following Christ, they&#x2019;re not going to hang around very long. </p> <p> Some within the framework of evangelicalism will tell you Jesus just wants you well, and if you&#x2019;re not well, it&#x2019;s because you haven&#x2019;t turned in your spiritual lottery ticket. If you&#x2019;re not rich, it&#x2019;s because you haven&#x2019;t claimed it. Jesus wants you free from debt, and if you send the televangelists enough money, that act of faith will free you from the demon of debt. Your salvation through Christ is a guarantee of health, wealth, prosperity, and happiness. </p> <p> The psychologically man-centered evangelicals tell you that Jesus gives you peace, Jesus gives you joy, Jesus makes you a better salesman, and Jesus helps you hit more home runs. Jesus really wants to make you feel better about yourself. He wants to elevate your self-image. He wants to put an end to your negative thinking. </p> <p> It&#x2019;s interesting how this trend has come into the church. I&#x2019;ve been around long enough to have seen it arrive. It blossomed, I think, most pointedly through the effort of the ever present small screen religious personality Robert Schuller and a book he wrote a number of years ago called <i>Self-Esteem: The New Reformation</i>. I reviewed that book for a national magazine. I thought Schuller&#x2019;s view was a turning point, literally, as the title says, an attempt to promote a new reformation. It was an effort to replace the biblical gospel with a new gospel. And it worked. </p> <p> In that book, Robert Schuller attacked the protestant reformation. Calling for a new reformation he wrote: &#x201c;It is precisely at this point that classical theology has erred in its insistence that theology be &#x2018;God-centered&#x2019; and not &#x2018;man-centered.&#x2019;&#x201d; So, according to Schuller, the first thing we have to do is put an end to classical, God-centered theology and replace it with man-centered theology. </p> <p> To define man-centered theology (an oxymoron), he wrote further, �This master plan of God is designed around the deepest needs of human beings&#x2014;self-dignity, self-respect, self-worth, self-esteem.&#x201d; For Schuller, the pearl of great price is self-respect and self-esteem. He went on to say, &#x201c;Success is to be defined as the gift of self-esteem that God gives us as a reward for our sacrificial service in building self-esteem in others. Win or lose: If we follow God&#x2019;s plan as faithfully as we can, we will feel good about ourselves. That is success!&#x201d;</p> <p> Pardon me if I don&#x2019;t join. I can&#x2019;t think of a plan with which I&#x2019;d less like to associate. </p> <p> In this new reformation of self-esteem, the first thing required is to pull God down from His supremely elevated place so you can then lift yourself up, replacing God-exalting theology with man-exalting, self-esteem psychology. To pull this off requires altering and misinterpreting the Bible and the gospel for the grand purpose of making people feel better about themselves, so they can fulfill their dreams and realize their visions. </p> <p> Maybe the most amazing statement in <i>Self-Esteem: The New Reformation</i> is the following: &#x201c;Once a person believes he is an &#x2018;unworthy sinner,&#x2019; it is doubtful if he can really honestly accept the saving grace God offers in Jesus Christ.&#x201d; So, if you want to be saved, according to this new gospel you cannot believe yourself to be an unworthy sinner. How twisted is that? How contrary to the truth is that? But it is just the sort of man-centered, self-esteem gospel that eventually became the seeker-friendly movement, which has hijacked so many churches. It&#x2019;s a kind of quasi-Christian narcissism, or self-love, that is characteristic of false teachers: according to 2 Timothy 3, which reminds us, &#x201c;Dangerous times will come, for men will be lovers of themselves&#x201d; (see 2 Tim. 3:1-2). </p> <p> Christianity, in the hands of seeker-sensitive church leaders, has become a &#x201c;get what you want&#x201d; rather than a &#x201c;give up everything&#x201d; movement. These leaders have prostituted the divine intention of the gospel. They have replaced the glory of God with the satisfaction of man. They have traded the concept of abandoning our lives to the honor of Christ for Christ honoring us. As such, our submission to His will is replaced by His submission to our will. Since people usually reject the real gospel, modern evangelicals have simply changed the message. </p> <p> A saint of many centuries ago got it right with this prayer:</p> <p> &#x201c;Lord high and holy, meek and lowly, let me learn by paradox that the way down is the way up, that to be low is to be high, that the broken heart is the healed heart, that the contrite spirit is the rejoicing spirit, that the repenting soul is the victorious soul, that to have nothing is to possess everything, that to bear the cross is to wear the crown, that to give is to receive. Let me find thy light in my darkness, thy joy in my sorrow, thy grace in my sin, thy riches in my poverty, thy glory in my valley, thy life in my death.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x201c;Thy life in my death&#x201d;? That&#x2019;s the true gospel. Jesus said it unmistakably and inescapably, &#x201c;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it&#x201d; (Matt. 16:24-25). It&#x2019;s not about exalting me, it&#x2019;s about <i>slaying</i> me. It&#x2019;s the death of self. You win by losing; you live by dying. And that is the heart message of the gospel. That is the essence of discipleship. </p> <p> The passage mentions nothing about improving your self-esteem, being rich and successful, feeling good about yourself, or having your felt needs met, which is what so many churches are preaching these days in order to sugarcoat the truth.</p> <p> So who&#x2019;s right? Is the message of Christianity self-fulfillment, or is it self-denial? It can&#x2019;t be both. If it&#x2019;s just a matter of opinion, I&#x2019;ll do my thing and you do yours, and we&#x2019;ll both cruise contentedly along in separate directions. But Christianity, the genuine gospel of Jesus Christ, is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of truth. What you want, or I want, or anybody else wants, makes no difference whatever. It is what it is&#x2014;by God&#x2019;s sovereign will. </p> <p> <b>The Hard Words of Jesus</b></p> <p> I have no idea how the fans of Christianity Lite reconcile their approach to religion with the teachings of Jesus, or how they become comfortable ignoring what He said. But the only acceptable approach&#x2014;for me and you&#x2014;is to take our Lord at His word in the single source of truth for every authentic Christian: the word of God revealed in the Bible. So let&#x2019;s go there. </p> <p> Luke 9 cuts to the core of the question of what Christianity is all about. Here, Jesus was with his disciples shortly after miraculously feeding a crowd of five thousand, who had come to hear him speak, with one modest basket of loaves and fishes. In Luke 9:23-26 we read:</p> <p> Then He said to them all, &#x201c;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it. For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or lost? For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own glory, and in His Father&#x2019;s, and of the holy angels.&#x201d;</p> <p> It&#x2019;s pretty simple. Anyone who wants to come after Jesus into the kingdom of God&#x2014;anyone who wants to be a Christian&#x2014;has to face three commands: 1) deny himself, 2) take up his cross daily, and 3) follow Him. These words are hard to believe. They&#x2019;re not consumer-friendly or seeker-sensitive. Christianity Lite is nowhere to be found. But this is not an obscure passage, or something different from other teachings of Jesus. These are principles that He taught consistently and repeatedly throughout His ministry, over and over again in all different contexts.</p> <p> This is not news. When Martin Luther launched the Protestant Reformation in 1517 by posting his ninety-five theses on the door at Wittenberg, he affirmed in the fourth thesis that salvation required self-hate. He wrote that &#x201c;self-hate remains right up to entrance into the kingdom of heaven.&#x201d; The original Greek word for &#x201c;deny&#x201d; means &#x201c;to refuse to associate with.&#x201d; The thought is that if you want to be Christ&#x2019;s disciple, and receive forgiveness and eternal life, you must refuse to associate any longer with the person you are! You are sick of your sinful self and want nothing to do with you anymore. And it may mean not just you, but your family. </p> <p> In Matthew 10:32, Jesus talked about confessing Him as Lord and Savior: &#x201c;Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven.&#x201d; And then in verses 34-36: &#x201c;Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and &#x2018;a man&#x2019;s enemies will be those of his own household.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p> It&#x2019;s not a friendly invitation; it&#x2019;s a warning: If you come to Christ, it may make your family worse, not better. It may send a rift into your family, the likes of which you have never experienced before. If you give your life to Jesus Christ, there will be an impassable gulf between you and people who don&#x2019;t give their lives to Him. In fact, as the New Age Hindu mystic Deepak Chopra said to me on CNN Television: &#x201c;You and I are in two different universes.&#x201d; I replied that he was exactly right. And that is not just true for strangers but also for family members, creating a severe breach in those most intimate of all relationships. </p> <p> Verse 37 adds, &#x201c;He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.&#x201d; If you&#x2019;re not willing to pay the price of a permanent split in your family unless your loved ones come to Christ&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re not willing to pay the price of greater trauma, greater conflict, greater suffering in your family&#x2014;then you&#x2019;re not worthy to be Jesus&#x2019; disciple.</p> <p> Verse 38: &#x201c;And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.&#x201d; Wait a minute. In Jesus&#x2019; time, people associated a cross with one thing and one thing alone: a cross was an instrument of death. He was saying that if you&#x2019;re not willing to have conflict with the world to the degree that it could cost you your life, then you&#x2019;re not worthy of Him.</p> <p> Verse 39: &#x201c;He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.&#x201d; This is an echo of Luke 9. It&#x2019;s about losing your life. It&#x2019;s not a man-centered theology, it&#x2019;s a Christ-centered theology that says, &#x201c;I give everything to Christ, no matter what it costs me, even if it costs me my life.&#x201d; </p> <p> <b>The True Gospel of Scripture</b></p> <p> This is a bedrock truth of Christianity that the Bible confirms repeatedly. Jesus said the same thing in many different ways. He said it in the familiar story of the rich young ruler. In Mark 10:17 the young synagogue leader ran up to Jesus, knelt before Him, and asked, &#x201c;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&#x201d;</p> <p> What a setup for personal evangelism! Jesus could have said, &#x201c;Pray this prayer&#x201d; or &#x201c;Make a decision to accept Me!&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t. Instead He confronted the young man with the reality of sin to reveal whether he was convicted of his wickedness and penitent over his iniquities. Jesus offered several of the Ten Commandments as examples of the law of God the young man had broken. </p> <p> Rejecting any thought of sinfulness and repentance, the young man bragged about having obeyed the Ten Commandments all his life. He thought he was a perfect candidate for eternal life. But he got a response he didn&#x2019;t expect. In verse 21, Jesus said, &#x201c;Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.&#x201d; Jesus exposed his self-righteousness and then uncovered his love for money. The young ruler wanted Jesus to show him how to have eternal life. But Jesus told him that the price was giving up his illusion of self-righteousness, recognizing himself rather as an unworthy, wretched sinner. And he needed to be willing to submit to the Lord Jesus, even if it meant he had to give up all his earthly possessions. He might not ask, but the requirement for eternal life is the willingness to give it all up if He does. </p> <p> The young man wouldn&#x2019;t do either&#x2014;admit his sin or deny himself. As verse 22 tells us, &#x201c;But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.&#x201d; He decided he&#x2019;d rather hold onto the deception of self-righteousness, and have his money and posse...</p></p><h2>The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to Chess, Third Edition</h2><p>Written by a U.S. Chess Champion, International Chess Grandmaster, and longtime instructor, this book includes information for both novice and expert, including over 400 illustrated chessboards and photos; over 20 pages of detailed answer key notes; a completely new chapter on new evidence about chess and its impact on brain power; a guide to the art of chess collectibles; and more. <ul> <li>Foreword by Larry Evans, former International Grandmaster and author of 20 highly acclaimed chess books and a popular monthly advice column in <i>Chess Life</i>.</li> <li>For the beginner or the champ, and for young and old.</li> </ul></p><p><b>Patrick Wolff</b> is a two-time U.S. Chess Champion (1992 and 1995) and an International Chess Grand-master.

Things are about to get spooky in Trenton, New Jersey.&nbsp;According to legend, the Jersey Devil prowls the Pine Barrens and soars above the treetops in the dark of night. As eerie as this might seem, there are things in the Barrens that are even more frightening and dangerous. And there are monkeys. Lots of monkeys.&nbsp;Wulf Grimoire is a world wanderer and an opportunist who can kill without remorse and disappear like smoke. He&#x2019;s chosen Martin Munch, boy genius, as his new business partner, and he&#x2019;s chosen the Barrens as his new playground.&nbsp;Munch received his doctorate degree in quantum physics when he was twenty-two. He&#x2019;s now twenty-four, and while his brain is large, his body hasn&#x2019;t made it out of the boys&#x2019; department at Macy&#x2019;s.

Martin Munch would be happy if he could just get a woman naked and tied to a tree.&nbsp;Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has Munch on her most-wanted list for failure to appear in court. Plum is the all-American girl stuck in an uncomfortable job, succeeding on luck and tenacity. Usually she gets her man. This time she gets a monkey.

And if truth were told, he wouldn&#x2019;t mind setting Stephanie Plum in his crosshairs.&nbsp;Diesel and Plum hunt down Munch and Grimoire, following them into the Barrens, surviving cranberry bogs, the Jersey Devil, a hair-raising experience, sand in their underwear, and, of course . . . monkeys.<br></p><p><p><b> #1 <i>New York Times </i>besteller</b></p><p><b> #1 <i>Washington Post </i>besteller</b></p><p><b> #1 <i>Publishers Weekly </i>besteller</b></p><p><b> #1 <i>USA Today </i>besteller</b></p><br><br><p><b> Turn on all the lights and check under your bed.</b></p><p><b> Things are about to get </b><b><i>PLUM SPOOKY</i></b><b>...</b></p><br><br><p>Trenton, New Jersey&#x2013;based bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is the all-American girl stuck in an uncomfortable job, succeeding on luck and tenacity.

Francis Crawford of Lymond moves to Muscovy, where he becomes advisor and general to the half-mad tsar. Yet even as Lymond tries to civilize a court that is still frozen in the attitudes of the Middle Ages, forces in England conspire to enlist this infinitely useful man in their own schemes.</p><p>Dorothy Dunnett was born in 1923 in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland. Her time at Gillespie's High School for Girls overlapped with that of the novelist Muriel Spark. From 1940-1955, she worked for the Civil Service as a press officer. In 1946, she married Alastair Dunnett, later editor of <b>The Scotsman</b>. <br><br>Dunnett started writing in the late 1950s. Her first novel, <b>The Game of Kings</b>, was published in the United States in 1961, and in the United Kingdom the year after. She published 22 books in total, including the six-part Lymond Chronicles and the eight-part Niccolo Series, and co-authored another volume with her husband. Also an accomplished professional portrait painter, Dunnett exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy on many occasions and had portraits commissioned by a number of prominent public figures in Scotland.<br><br>She also led a busy life in public service, as a member of the Board of Trustees of the National Library of Scotland, a Trustee of the Scottish National War Memorial, and Director of the Edinburgh Book Festival. She served on numerous cultural committees, and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 1992 she was awarded the Office of the British Empire for services to literature. She died on November 9, 2001, at the age of 78.Chapter I<br><br>Not to every young girl is it given to enter the harem of the Sultan of Turkey and return to her homeland a virgin.<br><br>The most prosaic schoolgirl in England, Philippa Somerville arrived home from Stamboul in the summer, having travelled stoically through Volos, Malta and Venice where she received, with mild distaste, the unexpected bequest of a fortune. From Venice, she crossed Europe to Calais, and at Calais she took ship for Tynemouth, whence she set off for her home in Flaw Valleys.<br><br>With her rode her henchman, guide and protector, a Scotsman called Abernethy. And on Archie Abernethy's stout arm, complaining, was a two-year-old boy named Kuz?m.<br><br>Sir Thomas Wharton and his company came across them all just outside Newcastle, and since there seemed to be a great many sumpter mules and a large number of hired soldiers guarding them, he gave himself the trouble of investigating. The sight of the Somerville child, returning after two years' absence on unexplained orgies abroad, was the reward of exemplary vigilance. His companion, a fledgling nobleman from Northumberland, was inclined to be more sentimental, but Sir Thomas quite rightly ignored him. Sir Thomas halted Philippa dead in her tracks, and made her vivaciously welcome.<br><br>It was a chaste encounter, conducted with grim efficiency by Archie Abernethy, with Philippa brazenly helping him. Yes, she remembered the Whartons, beside whom her late father had often fought. And yes, she remembered Austin Grey, Marquis of Allendale, although from a viewpoint four feet high, to a target not very much higher.<br><br>The Allendale estates were not far from Flaw Valleys. At twelve, this boy had been packed off to Padua and was now returned, dark, engaging and fragile in a doublet clearly fashioned in London. Peering from under her hood, Philippa favoured Austin Grey with a generous smile and returned to the business of supporting the lies Archie Abernethy was telling.<br><br>Yes, they had just come back from Malta. Yes, Mistress Somerville had been travelling abroad with a party, including her mother's friend, Crawford of Lymond. And that-indicating the now sleeping Kuz?m-was Mr Crawford's motherless son, being taken home to his grandmother in Scotland.<br><br>They looked at Mr Crawford's motherless son. 'Who's his mother?' Sir Thomas said with blossoming interest. 'Don't tell me Lymond married before he left Scotland. Too busy with other men's sisters.'<br><br>Archie said, 'No. He didna marry Kuz?m's mother. She's deid.'<br><br>Which was true. With a charming artlessness, Philippa squashed Tom Wharton's further inquiries and, prattling, prepared to detach herself. Austin Grey said, 'You aren't going home to Flaw Valleys?'<br><br>For a moment, staring at him, she thought of disaster. Her home was burnt down and Kate dead? The Scots had come over the Border and levelled it? Kate had married again without telling her? Philippa said, 'Yes. Why not?'<br><br>And Austin Grey said quickly, 'It's all right. Your mother is quite all right. She isn't there, that's all. She's gone to stay at Midculter Castle in Scotland.'<br><br>Which was how, wheeling about, the small but resolute migration from Turkey abjured the delights of home and Flaw Valleys and turned up six days later in Scotland.<br><br>Austin Grey, as it happened, reached Scotland before them. Voluntary and kind-hearted harbinger, he took his horse over the Border and traversing the hills of the Lowlands reached that part of Lanarkshire west where the castle of Midculter stood. There he called on Sybilla, the Dowager Lady Culter, and delivered to her certain papers at Philippa Somerville's behest.<br><br>Sybilla welcomed him in. White-haired, blue-eyed and urbane, she was quite capable of dealing with diffident young English noblemen and putting them instantly and disarmingly at their ease. Only after he had settled in front of her beautiful fireplace with a cup of her equally desirable wine in his hand did she glance at the packet he had given her and say, 'But it is for Mistress Somerville of Flaw Valleys?'<br><br>Austin Grey said, 'Yes. I thought she was here?'<br><br>For an elderly lady, the blue eyes confronting him were disconcertingly shrewd. 'Yes, she is,' Sybilla said. 'May I know who this is from?'<br><br>'I felt,' said Austin Grey, 'that you should break the news, Lady Culter. Mistress Somerville's daughter is home. She is travelling north. She should be with you in two or three days. The letters are from Philippa to her mother.'<br><br>Sybilla's eyes had become very bright. Then, 'You've seen her, Lord Allendale?' she said gently.<br><br>Austin said, 'She is in good heart, and travelling well. Only slowly, because of the baby.'<br><br>Lady Culter said nothing. She sat and looked at the young English messenger, with her lips parted and her eyes rather wide, so that the white skin of her brow was finely pleated. He hesitated and said, 'Your son's child. Mr Crawford's small boy called Kuz?m.'<br><br>'They found him,' Sybilla said.<br><br>He said, carefully, 'I don't know the story. But they have him quite safe, Lady Culter. If I may say so, he has just your colouring.'<br><br>'And my son?' Sybilla said finally.<br><br>'I gather . . . Perhaps the letters will tell you,' said Austin Grey. 'I gather he is still overseas.'<br><br>He left soon after that. But not before a light, brown-haired woman entered, whom he had seen all his youth about Hexham with her late husband Gideon Somerville, and her one small unkempt daughter Philippa. Kate Somerville came forward to greet him and was forestalled by her hostess the Dowager. 'Kate, he has letters from Philippa. She's safe, and on her way here with the child.'<br><br>But since women's tears, suppressed, made him uncomfortable, Austin Grey left as soon as possible after that.<br><br>By the time Philippa arrived at Midculter her mother and Kuz?m's grandmother between them knew the contents of the letters and diaries by heart and still could not reconcile them with the undersized fifteen-year-old who had left her uncle's home in London two winters ago, to plant herself willy nilly in the unsuitable company of Lady Culter's younger son Francis . . . Francis Crawford of Lymond, the hard-living leader of mercenaries whose by-blow Kuz?m had been snatched and used in a game by his enemies. Until he had caught up with and killed their leader, Graham Reid Malett.<br><br>It was typical that, in the wild hunt through far lands which followed, the main concern of Crawford of Lymond had been to kill Malett, not necessarily to rescue the child. And typical that, suspecting it, Philippa Somerville had stuck grimly to him, and biding her time, had found the child and brought it back, too.<br><br>It was at the first reading that Kate stopped and letting her hand fall, with the letter in it, said in tones of failing belief, 'But she was in the harem!'<br><br>Sybilla said calmly, 'It doesn't matter. If she says she was untouched, she was untouched. And no one else need know anything of it.'<br><br>'In Flaw Valleys?' Kate said. 'They'll ask her about the pattern on Suleiman's nightshirt. And I cannot believe that Francis was not fully capable of extracting his own son without Philippa's help. She was probably an unqualified nuisance.'<br><br>Sybilla turned over one or two pages. 'Certainly, she has remarkably little to say in his favour.'<br><br>Kate said glumly, 'I don't suppose they were speaking to one another. All she did was saddle him with two children to look after instead of one. She says he sent her straight home from Volos, and I can't say I'm surprised.'<br><br>'Well, at least she went,' said Sybilla comfortably. 'It says here he sent her straight home from Algiers as well, and she made Archie Abernethy turn back so that she could continue her hunt for the little one. I think we owe a great deal to your Philippa.'<br><br>'Grey hairs,' Philippa's mother suggested.<br><br>But it was Kate, daily tramping the battlements, who first saw the long line of dust which announced her young daughter's arrival. By the time Philippa's cort?ge arrived, they were all on the steps of Midculter: Kate, Sybilla and Richard, Sybilla's other older, responsible son, with his wife and young children beside him.<br><br>There seemed to be a great many mules. Straining her eyes as they turned in at the gates, Kate studied them vainly for Philippa. In the lead was a small bearded man bearing a bundle, and beside him a stylish person in a cloak and hood trimmed with lynx, at whom Kate cast a wistful glance, since she could not imagine her having much time for her bedraggled Philippa. Then, looking again at the smooth, polished face and the coils of intricately pleated shining brown hair, she saw that it was her bedraggled Philippa. She walked forward, slowly.<br><br>Philippa reined in and looked down at her mother. Sitting like the Queen of Sheba, with her face green with fright she said, 'Did you set my letters from Austin?'<br><br>Kate nodded. Clearing her throat, she said, 'Kevin and Lucy were expecting a nose-veil and curly-toed slippers.'<br><br>Her daughter's youthful brown eyes, losing their starkness, became visibly pink round the edges. 'They're in my luggage,' Philippa said. 'With my prayer mat. I thought you would show me the door. Perhaps. That is, one shouldn't think of other people's babies before one's own mother. I knew you would stop me.'<br><br>'I can't think how,' Kate Somerville said. 'Gunpowder? It was more than Mr Crawford evidently could do.'<br><br>'There were a few unpleasantnesses,' Philippa said guardedly. She stared at Kate, trying not to think of Mr Crawford's unpleasantnesses. Her nose, also, was growing faintly pink.<br><br>'There are times,' Kate said conversationally, 'when one wonders where that gentleman's habits came from. Are you going to come indoors on the horse, or can I help you . . . ?'<br><br>At which, giggling, Philippa Somerville slid, with her eyes overflowing, into her mother's damp and convulsive embrace.<br><br>Presently, there was the other meeting, with Lord Culter and his wife on the steps. Presently, too, came her first encounter with Lord Culter's mother Sybilla. But before that the Dowager, the soul of discretion, had wandered into the courtyard to speak to her old friend Archie Abernethy. 'We are so glad to see you. David will look after your men. Won't you give him your horse, and come inside with us? And----'<br><br>For the first time, with courtesy, her gaze dropped to the rugwrapped pack in his arms. '. . . And this is Khaireddin?'<br><br>Archie looked down, swore, and then apologized. 'We had him all nice,' he said. 'But he wanted to play Turks hiding in ambush. Kuz?m! It's your grannie!'<br><br>The bundle heaved, and Archie snapped, 'And you've made a right mess of your hair.'<br><br>A feathering of silky fair hair shot up from the core of the rug, followed by a round vermilion face with a belligerent blue stare. 'I want a short of Fippy's horse,' the object said.<br><br>Archie said peremptorily, 'You're not having a shot on anything; we've stopped. You're there. You're at your grannie's home in Midculter. Here she is, waiting.' And his attention drawn for the first time from the child Archie looked, a little anxiously, at Lymond's mother, who had said nothing at all.<br><br>And as though she felt his gaze, Sybilla raised her eyes from the silvery hair and blue eyes and charming, overheated two-year-old face, and smiled at him, and then said to her grandson, 'Hullo. Is your name Kuz?m?'<br><br>Kuz?m, abandoning the Turks, stared at her critically. Then he said, 'My rug's all crumply. Lift down me to walk?'<br><br>So Archie lowered him, and she received the solid weight and placed him on his two feet and then, kneeling, steadied him. 'Not Khaireddin?' she said to Archie.<br><br>'Kuz?m's his pet name. It means Lambkin.' Dismounting, he held the child by the shoulders. 'Mr Crawford's all right, my lady. Ye'll not expect him home yet: he's not a man for mentioning plans. But the bairn will make you good company.'<br><br>The bairn, tugging himself free, set off at a trot towards Philippa. Following slowly, 'Where is Mr Crawford?' Sybilla said.<br><br> 'God---That is, we're no' all that certain,' said Archie. 'We left him in Volos, Greece, a wee bit overcome by the weather. Then we heard he had gone. . . . You'll see a change in the young lady?'<br><br>'Yes,' the Dowager said. They had reached the rest of her family. Holding out her hands to the new, self-contained Philippa she said, embracing her, 'Although I don't know how we are going to explain it.'<br><br>'We met Sir Thomas Wharton,' Philippa said deprecatingly.<br><br>'So it will be all over Hexham,' said Kate. 'Since that man went to court he's been worse than a midwife. You won't be dull, Philippa mine. We shall have plenty of callers.'<br><br>'Mostly male,' Richard said, grinning.<br><br>'Isn't it queer?' Philippa said. Standing at the top of the steps, she caught Archie's eye and then removed her gaze from him, unfocused. 'It didn't occur to me that people might gossip. It was Mr Crawford who warned me.'<br><br>'I'm glad he took the trouble,' Sybilla said tartly. 'To allow you to travel home on your own, after treating you, so far as I can see, like one of his own underpaid mercenaries, must be the abominable highlight of a strictly egotistical career.'<br><br>Kate, better acquainted with her daughter, said, 'How did he warn you?'<br><br>Philippa gazed again round the courtyard. The chests were being shouldered indoors. Archie, lifting Kuz?m, had carried him across to young Kevin and Lucy. The horses were being led away. Richard was looking at her: the 3rd Baron Crawford of Culter, more heavily built than he had been, but still level-headed and pleasant: running his home of Midculter, raising his children, sustaining, year after year, the blows which fell without warning, the traps which opened, the doors which shut in his face because of his brother Crawford of Lymond. Richard smiled.<br><br>Philippa said, 'He suggested I should get married.'<br><br>Kate, whose hair was coming down in the wind, gave a groan. 'A profound offering of typical masculine subtlety,' said Philippa's mother. 'I might have known it. Come inside. I want to look at your earrings.'<br><br>'So I did,' Philippa said.<br><br>There was a mind-cracking silence. 'What?' said Richard.<br><br>'I did marry. On paper. To give me some standing at first, especially because of Kuz?m. Of course, it will all be annulled in a moment. It was,' said Philippa again, austerely emphatic, 'strictly on paper.'<br><br>It was Sybilla who walked slowly forward and, taking the girl's manicured hands, held them both, firmly and coolly in her own. 'Philippa. You are not to worry. We are all here and ready to help you.

Strictly on paper?'</p><h2>The Leaphorn &amp; Chee Novels</h2><p><p>Three of <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Tony Hillerman's most popular novels are together for the first time in one volume.</p><p><strong>Tony Hillerman</strong> is one of the most revered and honored mystery writers published today. This stunning collection includes the critically acclaimed novels <strong>Skinwalkers</strong>, <strong>A Thief of Time</strong>, and <strong>Coyote Waits</strong>, all of which have been adapted for PBS by producer Robert Redford. This is a must-have anthology from one of the great masters of suspense.</p><p>In <strong>Skinwalkers</strong>, three shotgun blasts explode into the trailer of Officer Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police. Chee survives to join partner Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn in a frightening investigation that takes them into a dark world of ritual, witchcraft, and blood -- all tied to the elusive and evil "skinwalker." In <strong>A Thief of Time</strong>, a noted anthropologist vanishes at a moonlit Indian ruin where "thieves of time" ravage sacred ground for profit. When two corpses appear amid stolen goods and bones at an ancient burial site, Leaphorn and Chee must plunge into the past to unearth the astonishing truth behind a mystifying series of horrific murders.</p><p>And in <strong>Coyote Waits</strong>, it wasn't the car fire that killed Navajo Tribal Policeman Delbert Nez -- a bullet did. Officer Jim Chee's good friend Del lies dead, and a whiskey-soaked Navajo shaman is found with the murder weapon. The old man is Ashie Pinto. He's quickly arrested for homicide and defended by a woman Chee could either love or loathe. But Pinto won't utter a word of confession or denial. Leaphorn and Chee must unravel a complex plot involving a historical find, a lost fortune, and the mythical Coyote, who is always waiting, and always hungry.</p></p><p><p>TONY HILLERMAN served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and received the Edgar and Grand Master Awards. His other honors include the Center for the American Indian&#x2019;s Ambassador Award, the Spur Award for Best Western Novel, and the Navajo Tribal Council Special Friend of the Dineh award. A native of Oklahoma, Tony Hillerman lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until his death in 2008.</p></p><h2>The Pioneers Go West (Landmark Books)</h2><p>Seventeen-year-old Moses Schallenberger wanted to go to California. In 1844, he joined a wagon train to do just that. There was only one problem: Nobody had ever made it to California by wagon before. For a year, he and <br>50 others struggled through high mountain passes and across wide rushing rivers, enduring dangerous encounters with Indians and buffalo, inclement weather, difficult terrain, near-starvation and disaster.Ultimately, Moses and his friends succeeded&#x2013;becoming the first pioneers to cross the Sierra Nevadas by wagon. Today, the trail they blazed is a major route into California.</p><p></p><h2>Japanese Gardening in Small Spaces</h2><p>A practical guide to planning and constructing a Japanese garden. Step-by-step instructions explain every facet, from displaying plants and rocks to mastering drainage and lighting, to creating bamboo fences and hedges.</p><p><br>ISAO YOSHIKAWA was born in 1940 in Tokyo. Having gained a degree in architecture from Shibaura Institute of Technology, Tokyo, he expanded his career as a keen and creative garden designer, and established the Japan Garden Society in 1963. Besides representing this society and his own laboratory, Yoshikawa Isao Garden Research Institute, he sits on the executive board of the China Landscape Architects Society in both Suzhou and Hangzhou as an honorary member. He has written numerous books on gardening including THE BAMBOO FENCES OF JAPAN, STONE ARANGEMENT GARDENS, RESEARCH DATA FOR GARDENING DETAILS and EXCELLENT GARDENS OF CHINA (some of them published only in Japanese).<br></p><h2>Soul Survivor: How Thirteen Unlikely Mentors Helped My Faith Survive the Church</h2><p>Philip Yancey, whose explorations of faith have made him a guide for millions of readers, feels no need to defend the church. "When someone tells me yet another horror story about the church, I respond, 'Oh, it's even worse than that. Let me tell you my story.'I have spent most of my life in recovery from the church."<br><br>Yancey acknowledges that many spiritual seekers find few answers and little solace in the institutional church. "I have met many people, and heard from many more, who have gone through a similar process of mining truth from their religious past: Roman Catholics who flinch whenever they see a nun or priest, former Seventh Day Adventists who cannot drink a cup of coffee without a stab of guilt, Mennonites who worry whether wedding rings give evidence of worldliness."<br><br>How did Yancey manage to survive spiritually despite early encounters with a racist, legalistic church that he now views as almost cultic? In this, his most soul-searching book yet, he probes that very question. He tells the story of his own struggle to reclaim belief, interwoven with inspiring portraits of notable people from all walks of life, whom he calls his spiritual directors.<i> </i><b>Soul Survivor </b>is his tribute to thirteen remarkable individuals, mentors who transformed his life and work.<br><br>Besides recalling their effect on him, Yancey also provides fresh glimpses of the lives and faith journeys of each one. From the scatterbrained journalist G. K. Chesterton to the tortured novelists Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, to contemporaries such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Annie Dillard, and Robert Coles, Yancey gives inspiring portraits of those who modeled for him a life-enhancing rather than a life-constricting faith.<br><br>"I became a writer, I now believe, to sort out and reclaim words used and misused by the Christians of my youth," Yancey says. "These are the people who ushered me into the Kingdom. In many ways they are why I remain a Christian today, and I want to introduce them to other spiritual seekers."<br><br><b>Soul Survivor</b> offers illuminating insights that will enrich the lives of veteran believers and cautious seekers alike. Yancey's own story, unveiled here as never before, is a beacon for those who seek to rejuvenate their faith, and for those who are still longing for something to have faith in.</p><p>Like many Christians, Philip Yancey has often felt kicked around, abused, and damaged by the institutional church. And like many Christians, he has found solace in reading about and getting to know some extraordinary individual believers. He profiles 13 of those believers in <i>Soul Survivor: How My Faith Survived the Church</i>. "I became a writer, I now believe, to sort out words used and misused by the church of my youth," Yancey writes in the book's first chapter. The church of his youth, which described itself as "New Testament, Blood-bought, Born-again, Premillennial, Dispensational, fundamental," Yancey now describes as a frightening place where racism and bigotry were regularly preached from the pulpit. After graduating from Bible college, Yancey became a writer and chose to direct his attention to "people I could learn from, people I might want to emulate," such as C. Everett Koop and Robert Coles. He also read widely and passionately--Leo Tolstoy, Martin Luther King Jr., G.K. Chesterton, and Annie Dillard, to name a few. <i>Soul Survivor</i> offers probing, honest profiles of 13 individuals who have "helped restore to me the mislaid treasures of God." For most readers, these profiles will serve as starting points to explore the lives and minds of the individuals who have inspired Yancey. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"It would seem the height of immodesty to praise a book that devotes an entire chapter to praising me. Let me therefore merely recommend it to anyone interested in a relaxed and conversational account of how an assortment of odd fish were variously caught up in and transformed by the Christian Gospel"<br><br><b> -Frederick Buechner, author of The Sacred Journey, The Hungering Dark and The Eyes of the Heart</b>. <br><br>"I love, and am grateful for, every marvelous book Mr. Yancey writes."<br><br><b>-Anne Lamott</b></p><h2>Tom Clancy Point of Contact (A Jack Ryan Jr. Novel)</h2><p><b>Jack Ryan, Jr., learns that sometimes the deadliest secret may be standing right next to you in this electrifying adventure in Tom Clancy&#x2019;s <b>#1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling series</b>.<br><br></b>Former U.S. Senator Weston Rhodes is a defense contractor with an urgent problem.

Years before, he had been an English major at Baltimore&#x2019;s Loyola College and had always dreamed of writing a novel. His first effort,&nbsp;<i>The Hunt for Red October</i>, sold briskly as a result of rave reviews, then catapulted onto the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller list after President Reagan pronounced it &#x201c;the perfect yarn.&#x201d; From that day forward, Clancy established himself as an undisputed master at blending exceptional realism and authenticity, intricate plotting, and razor-sharp suspense. He passed away in October 2013.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Mike Maden</b> grew up working in the canneries, feed mills and slaughterhouses of California&#x2019;s San Joaquin Valley.

It didn&#x2019;t really matter. Either way, Jack Ryan, Jr., knew he was going to die in the next two minutes.</p><p>The F470 Zodiac rubber raiding craft pounded through the chopping waves beneath a storm-shrouded moon. Jack clutched the safety ropes in both fists to keep from getting thrown overboard. So did Adara Sherman, seated in front of him. She was getting it worse than he was. Every bounce threw more spray in their faces. Jack&#x2019;s NVGs were spattered with ice. He couldn&#x2019;t risk wiping off the night-vision lenses while he was riding this bucking bronco. But a half-mile ahead he could still barely make out the oil rig, lights off, its hulking frame a black shadow above the surging sea. That was fine by Jack. The darkness shielded their approach.</p><p>Jack&#x2019;s teeth chattered and his mind clouded in the numbing cold. The freezing North Sea wind seemed to slice right through his five-millimeter wetsuit, and the stinging sleet felt like a broken beer bottle dragged across his exposed skin.</p><p>Despite their misery, Bartosz &#x201c;Midas&#x201d; Jankowski gunned the engine full throttle, his goggled eyes fixed on his GPS. They were supposed to run quiet, but they got off late. At least the howling wind swept away most of the noise from the baffled fifty-five-horsepower outboard motor in back.</p><p>The high winds also meant a helicopter landing was out of the question, and fast-roping out of it&#x2014;Jack&#x2019;s favorite new skill&#x2014;even more so. All three of them were getting beat to hell, and time wasn&#x2019;t their friend. If they didn&#x2019;t reach the oil platform ladder in the next two minutes, they would fail the mission.</p><p><i>Assuming we survive for the next two minutes,</i> Jack reminded himself.</p><p>And then there were the gunmen on the oil rig to deal with.&nbsp;But right now, armed killers seemed like the least of their problems.</p><p>As if on cue, a rogue wave swelled beneath the speeding craft, lifting the port side out of the water. Jack had shoved the toes of his boots through the safety rope along the rubber deck for purchase but felt himself pitching over the side anyway. Midas grabbed the drag handle of Jack&#x2019;s vest with a sure hand at the last&nbsp;second, saving him from a headlong dive into the angry black&nbsp;sea.</p><p>Jack glanced to his right at the other Zodiac just a few yards away. In the green haze of his iced NVGs, Jack saw Dom Caruso flash him a quick &#x201c;Okay?&#x201d; with his gloved thumb. Jack thumbed him back. No time for chitchat. Ding Chavez drove Dom&#x2019;s boat, his eyes fixed on the GPS locator.</p><p>The five special operators of The Campus were a close-knit team, the tip of the spear of the private &#x201c;off-the-books&#x201d; intelligence agency known only to President Ryan and a select few of his closest advisers. They were a small organization, but they punched hard&#x2014;and far above their weight. This mission was proof of that. They did the jobs the CIA or other government intelligence services couldn&#x2019;t do. Or wouldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Tonight was no exception.</p><p>Jack ran through the schematics of the oil rig platform in his mind again, particularly the control room and machine shop&#x2014;his two targets. Gavin Biery&#x2019;s webmaster magic had come through again. If it weren&#x2019;t for him they&#x2019;d be going in totally blind.</p><p>Gavin&#x2019;s intel brief confirmed four hostages and six Green Army Faction eco-terrorists, armed and trained. But intel on a hostage-rescue operation like this was always sketchy. John Clark&#x2019;s warning echoed in his head. &#x201c;Stay frosty out there. You don&#x2019;t know what you don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p><i>True that.</i></p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time,&#x201d; Ding whispered in everyone&#x2019;s comms.</p><p>&#x201c;Roger that,&#x201d; Midas confirmed.</p><p>Jack watched Ding&#x2019;s boat veer off at a sharp angle, its bulletproof Armorflate rubber skin shredding water into the turn. The small drilling platform had two access ladders. Jack&#x2019;s boat would take the front; Ding and Dom would scramble up the back. On training runs with the Norwegian MJK (Marinejegerkommandoen) this past week, the weather had been cold but calm and they&#x2019;d been able to get the timing down perfectly. But out here tonight on a raging North Sea, everything was up for grabs.</p><p>The mission had two goals: save the hostages and kill or capture the tangos. The Green Army Faction threatened not only to kill the captured oil workers but also to blow the rig, causing another catastrophic oil-spill disaster like Deepwater Horizon if their ransom demands weren&#x2019;t met. American policy had always been to ignore ransom demands from terrorists. Meeting them inevitably led to more terror. Any student of history knew that. But some governments and corporations apparently didn&#x2019;t read history.</p><p>Those were the people Green Army Faction targeted. -Profitably.</p><p>But in this case, intel from an informant indicated that the group on the rig had no intention of surrendering after the money transfer. In their sick minds, they planned on &#x201c;saving the earth&#x201d; by poisoning the sea in order to fuel more public outrage at the oil industry. Killing the oil rig workers was a sacred bonus, like ISIS butchering captive infidels.</p><p>The decommissioned oil rig stood in an abandoned field dead center in the North Sea and in international waters. The Texas wildcatting team was developing new fracking-style technology to revive dead underwater wells. The GAF got wind of it and struck.</p><p>When it became clear that the hostages would be killed, the company&#x2019;s desperate security chief called his friend John Clark, hoping Clark could mobilize some of his old Rainbow Six connections. But with only a four-hour window remaining, there weren&#x2019;t any options.</p><p>Except one.</p><p>By sheer coincidence, John Clark had arranged for The Campus operators to train with MJK operators for exactly this kind of mission just two hours away. The Norwegian government wouldn&#x2019;t allow the MJK to aid in the assault, but Clark called in a few chits and arranged for the <i>M�vik</i>&#x2014;a Swedish-built CB90-class fast-assault craft&#x2014;to drop the team off. After that, they were on their own.</p><p>The hastily devised plan was that both Campus teams would scale the ladders at the same time and make a simultaneous assault on three of the four buildings on the rig, taking out bad guys along the way. Jack&#x2019;s team would take the front of the platform. Midas and Adara would go for the crew&#x2019;s quarters, where the hostages were probably kept, while Jack cleared the control room, after which he&#x2019;d drive toward the machine shop. On the back side of the rig, Ding&#x2019;s two-man team would first assault the&nbsp;drilling and process modules, where the explosives were undoubtedly positioned. After clearing them, they would support the assault on the crew&#x2019;s quarters or machine shop as needed. Each team would drive toward the center of the facility, herding any surviving GAF fighters into the middle and forcing them to surrender&#x2014;or die.</p><p>At least, that was the plan.</p><p>They all agreed that clear and constant communication was key to their success. No telling what the real situation was on the rig or the precise number of either terrorists or hostages.</p><p>Their biggest challenge tonight beyond the hellish weather was their limited firepower. Each team member carried the same two suppressed weapons systems: short-barreled SIG Sauer MPX submachine guns and SIG Sauer P229 pistols, both in nine-millimeter. They couldn&#x2019;t use larger calibers for fear of overpenetration, and explosives or even flash-bang grenades were out of the question in the highly flammable environment. Brains, brawn, and steady hands were their only force multipliers. Given the makeup of the team, Jack figured that was good enough.</p><p>The bow of the Zodiac dipped as Midas throttled down. That told Jack they were close. The rolling swells kept the boat -rocking violently, but not so badly that Jack couldn&#x2019;t raise his hands to finally clear his NVGs. The boat was just a few yards away from the platform ladder now. He could barely make out the other Zodiac on the far side of the rig. The sleet turned to thick flakes of snow, reducing the value of the NVGs to nearly zero now.</p><p>&#x201c;Ten seconds,&#x201d; Midas whispered in the comms.</p><p>&#x201c;Rog&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. op,&#x201d; Ding replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Midas whispered.</p><p>No reply.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; Jack spoke into his comms.</p><p>He saw Midas&#x2019;s lips move but didn&#x2019;t hear anything in his earpiece.</p><p><i>Comms down!</i></p><p>As soon as Jack thought it, Midas was already switching to hand signals.</p><p>This was going to be an old-school op for sure.</p><p>The Zodiac slowed further. Adara reached down for the rope and its hard rubber grapple as Midas cut the engine. The boat was lifted by another high wave and crashed violently into one of the thick steel piers supporting the platform, but the inflated rubber bounced harmlessly off in the direction of the nearby ladder. Adara tossed the grapple and hit a ladder rung on the first try, then she and Jack pulled hard on the rope until the Zodiac was close enough to tie off and secure.</p><p>The problem now was the other boat. It was critical that both teams scale the ladders at the same time. Jack pulled his tactical light and flashed it twice in Ding&#x2019;s direction. A moment later someone flashed back.</p><p>Jack signaled &#x201c;good to go&#x201d; to Midas and Adara. They both acknowledged and Adara took the lead, lifting one boot from the heaving deck to the top of the gunwale, then timing her next step onto the ladder with her other boot to the rising swell, pulling herself up with one hand as the boat lifted to its apogee, all in a singular motion of effortless grace. She instantly began the arduous hundred-foot climb.</p><p>Jack watched her in the flickering green glow of his goggles. From down here in the rocking boat it looked like Adara was climbing up into the blackened portal of a rusted steel hell.</p><p>The boat pitched down again as Midas took position next. At the top of the next swell Midas stepped up. He landed a heavy boot on a rung and pulled his broad frame up by his strong arms, then began his swift, wordless climb.</p><p>The boat plummeted down again, and Jack&#x2019;s stomach with it, hitting the bottom of the swell so hard that Jack&#x2019;s knees nearly buckled. The waves were getting worse.</p><p>Jack tugged on his MPX to verify the sling was still snug as he stood back up and planted his right boot on the gunwale. A moment later he felt the massive surge beneath him and the boat rocketed upward, but the hull crashed hard against the steel ladder just as Jack stepped off, throwing him forward. He barely managed to grab an icy rung with both gloved hands as his knees slammed against the sharp steel, boots dangling in midair. A moment later his feet found a rung and he was secure. His eyes tracked the fleeing swell as it crashed against another steel pylon.</p><p>His heart raced. <i>That was close</i>.</p><p>Jack paused just long enough to take a deep breath and gather his wits.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw another rogue wave suddenly breaking over him in a white-capped fury.</p><p>He braced himself against the ladder just as the wave hit.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>2</p><p>All Jack could do was hold on grab-ass tight. The wave hit him like a great gray bull, smashing the side of his helmeted face against the ladder&#x2019;s steel, but somehow he hung on.</p><p>A second passed and the furious gray monster sped away into the forbidding dark.</p><p>Jack couldn&#x2019;t believe his luck. He didn&#x2019;t wait for the next one.</p><p>He untangled himself as quickly as he could and began the ascent, spitting and coughing up briny seawater through his mouth and nose. He scrambled as fast as he dared on the frozen steel, driven upward by John Clark&#x2019;s raspy voice ringing in his brain: &#x201c;Shit happens in threes.&#x201d; Comms going down and a big-ass rogue wave counted for two. He didn&#x2019;t want to think about what the third might be.</p><p>The first few soaking-wet steps were easy, but his left foot slipped badly on the next ice-coated rung. Once again his heart raced, but his fast reflexes secured him tightly to the ladder. His mind was clearer now&#x2014;running from death had that effect on a man&#x2019;s brain&#x2014;and in a moment he was in his stride, carefully but swiftly alternating hands and feet in the dangerous ascent.</p><p>He climbed several rungs before glancing up to locate the rest of his team. They were already near the top and scrambling fast, unaware of his near-death experience. The gunshot to Adara&#x2019;s leg in Chicago last year clearly hadn&#x2019;t slowed her down.</p><p>Gaining confidence in his stride, Jack picked up the climbing tempo. The adrenaline was fueling him now, which helped cut the cold, even though he was drenched and the exertion was warming him up despite the blasting snow. The burning in his thighs was a good sign that he was still alive. Even the seawater still stinging his sinuses helped clear his mind.</p><p>So far, so good.</p><p>He slowed as he entered the guardrail cage near the top of the&nbsp;ladder, expecting Adara&#x2019;s gloved hand in the open hole to signal him to hold. The plan was for the three of them to rally at the entrance, then split up and assault their respective targets some ninety feet apart. He popped his head up quickly to scan the platform.</p><p>Adara and Midas were gone. <i>What the hell?</i></p><p>So much for the plan.</p><p>Jack cleared the hole and the guardrails and assumed a crouching position on the steel-grated deck, designed to keep seawater from accumulating. Most of the snow fell through, so&nbsp;there were no clear boot prints for Jack to follow. He glanced to his left, where the crew&#x2019;s quarters were located. He didn&#x2019;t see&nbsp;either Midas or Adara, but according to the plan that&#x2019;s where they were headed. The schematics indicated that the entrance door was around the corner from where he was, so if the two of them were positioning there, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to see them anyway.</p><p>Jack checked his watch. If the other team was in place, they&#x2019;d hit their door in the next thirty seconds.</p><p>Time to get to work.</p><p>Jack racked the charging handle of his MPX. The terrorists would all be inside in weather like this. Of course they were. He smiled to himself. <i>What moron would be outside in this shit?</i> The snow fell heavier now in the fierce wind&#x2014;near-blizzard conditions. Jack brushed away the ice crusting on the back of his gloves.</p><p>He tried his comms again but still got no reply. Even if Adara and Midas were squatting here next to him, they couldn&#x2019;t talk to one another&#x2014;in this wind they&#x2019;d have to shout, and even if they could hear one another they&#x2019;d risk giving their positions away.</p><p>Jack watched the seconds tick by. He was grateful for the long, tedious hours of training he&#x2019;d spent over the last week on a platform not unlike this one, especially now that he was finally here in the freezing dark, getting hammered by gale-force winds and with time slipping away. He checked his watch again.</p></p><h2>The Poisoned City: Flint&#39;s Water and the American Urban Tragedy</h2><p><p><b>When the people of Flint, Michigan, turned on their faucets in April 2014, the water pouring out was poisoned with lead and other toxins.</b> </p><p>Through a series of disastrous decisions, the state government had switched the city&#x2019;s water supply to a source that corroded Flint&#x2019;s aging lead pipes. Complaints about the foul-smelling water were dismissed: the residents of Flint, mostly poor and African American, were not seen as credible, even in matters of their own lives.</p><p>It took eighteen months of activism by city residents and a band of dogged outsiders to force the state to admit that the water was poisonous. By that time, twelve people had died and Flint&#x2019;s children had suffered irreparable harm. The long battle for accountability and a humane response to this man-made disaster has only just begun.</p><p>In the first full account of this American tragedy, Anna Clark's<i> The Poisoned City</i> recounts the gripping story of Flint&#x2019;s poisoned water through the people who caused it, suffered from it, and exposed it. It is a chronicle of one town, but could also be about any American city, all made precarious by the neglect of infrastructure and the erosion of democratic decision making. Places like Flint are set up to fail&#x2015;and for the people who live and work in them, the consequences can be fatal.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2018:</strong> Flint, Michigan, has become a byword for municipal failure. When the government switched the city's water source, residents started to complain that the water tasted strange and they were growing ill. After repeated strong statements from the city and state claiming the water was just fine, interspersed with perplexing boil-water alerts, residents finally took large-scale water testing into their own hands, and a local hospital analyzed its patient data to prove that residents were suffering levels of lead poisoning at an unheard-of scale. Detroit journalist Anna Clark deftly sets the stage for Flint's man-made disaster: the big drop in population that affected the pipe infrastructure, Flint's financial emergencies, and the long history of sidelining poor and African-American residents in Flint. As Flint's water failures cascade and the population continues to sicken, Clark provides even-keeled reporting of the crisis even as the outrages pile up despite Michigan's attempts to bury them. Those who also read <em>A Civil Action</em> by Jonathan Harr will wonder how we got to this point with bad water yet again...and why, this time, it&#x2019;s the government who is harming its citizens. <em>The Poisoned City</em> will open readers' eyes to both the scary truth that most of our cities rely on equally weak water infrastructure and how a city's residents can force others to listen. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, Amazon Book Review</em><b>Anna Clark</b> is a journalist living in Detroit.

He'll go on and on with stories about tree-hugging or metaphors involving raw potatoes; he'll tell you how to eat mindfully, even how to breathe and walk; he'll suggest looking closely at a flower and to see the sun as your heart. As the Zen teacher Richard Baker commented, however, Nhat Hanh is "a cross between a cloud, a snail, and piece of heavy machinery." Sooner or later, it begins to sink in that Nhat Hanh is conveying a depth of psychology and a world outlook that require nothing less than a complete paradigm shift. Through his cute stories and compassionate admonitions, he gradually builds up to his philosophy of interbeing, the notion that none of us <i>is</i> separately, but rather that we <i>inter-are</i>. The ramifications are explosive. How can we mindlessly and selfishly pursue our individual ends, when we are inextricably bound up with everyone and everything else? We see an enemy not as focus of anger but as a human with a complex history, who could be us if we had the same history.

World-renowned Zen master, spiritual leader, and author Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how to make positive use of the very situations that usually pressure and antagonize us. For him a ringing telephone can be a signal to call us back to our true selves. Dirty dishes, red lights, and traffic jams are spiritual friends on the path to "mindfulness" -- the process of keeping our consciousness alive to our present experience and reality. The most profound satisfactions, the deepest feelings of joy and completeness lie as close at hand as our next aware breath and the smile we can form right now.<p> Lucidly and beautifully written, <i>Peace Is Every Step</i> contains commentaries and meditations, personal anecdotes and stories from Nhat Hanh's experiences as a peace activist, teacher, and community leader. It begins where the reader already is -- in the kitchen, office, driving a car, walking a part -- and shows how deep meditative presence is available now. Nhat Hanh provides exercises to increase our awareness of our own body and mind through conscious breathing, which can bring immediate joy and peace. Nhat Hanh also shows how to be aware of relationships with others and of the world around us, its beauty and also its pollution and injustices. the deceptively simple practices of <i>Peace Is Every Step</i> encourage the reader to work for peace in the world as he or she continues to work on sustaining inner peace by turning the "mindless" into the mindFUL.</p><p> This book of illuminating reminders bid us to reorient the way we look at the world...toward a humanitarian perspective." --<i>Publisher Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Women Artists and the Surrealist Movement</h2><p><p><strong>This pioneering book stands as the most comprehensive treatment of the lives, ideas and art works of the remarkable group of women who were an essential part of the Surrealist movement.</strong></p></p><p>Whitney Chadwick is an art historian.

If not his private shame at how his life there had gone to hell. He was chief of police in Paradise, Mass.This was his town now. Yet there were still some things about the East Coast and the Atlantic he had never gotten used to and wasn't sure he ever would. Nor'easters, for one. He found their brooding, slate-gray clouds and roiling tides a little unnerving. These late-fall or winter storms seemed to blow up out of spite, raking across whole swaths of New England or the Mid� Atlantic, leaving nothing but pain in their wake.<br><br>As was his habit, he drove through the darkened streets of Paradise&nbsp;in his old Ford Explorer before heading horne. He wanted to get a few hours' sleep before going back to work. Maybe a drink, too. The storm wasn't supposed to make landfall until about midnight, but the winds were bending trees back against their will, sleet already pelting his&nbsp;windshield. Jesse shook his head thinking &nbsp;about that. About how storms in the east warned you they were coming. About how they told you when they were coming and then kicked your ass.<br><br> It was different out west. He remembered how, when he was a kid in Tucson, a few inches of unexpected rain would morph into the cascading wall of a flash flood, washing away everything before it. One minute people would be horseback riding or hiking through bone-dry arroyos and the next they'd &nbsp;be swallowed up by waters squeezed between canyon walls and ground sun baked so mercilessly hard it could not soak up a drop of rain. Jesse remembered that he had once gone out with his dad, searching for some missing hikers after one of the floods. How they had come upon the body of a drowned horse. It had been many years since he had thought of that horse, its carcass rotting in the Arizona sun.<br><br> Then in L.A. there were the choking Santa Ana winds that would blow across the mountains, swoop down into the valleys and through the canyons from the Mojave. The Santa Anas brought destruction with them, too, sucking the moisture out of the vegetation, wildfires following in their path. Fires that would consume whole hillsides, one after the other. Sometimes the winds blew so strongly through the &nbsp;canyons that &nbsp;they howled. His ex-partner used to say it was Satan whistling while he worked. At the moment, Jesse felt about as far away from those Santa An as as a man could get, but he thought he could still hear Satan's whistling in &nbsp;the &nbsp;winds that &nbsp;buffeted his SUV.<br><br> There weren't many cars on the road, but a &nbsp;few brave or stupid souls dared the weather. Jesse knew most of the vehicles. Robbie Wil� son, the fire chief, was out in his red Jeep, looking for trouble. Jesse didn't have much patience for men like Wilson, guys who liked being big fish in tiny ponds. Little men with big chips on both shoulders. Men with something to prove, always on the prowl for a chance to&nbsp;prove it. Jesse could never figure out what it was Robbie Wilson had to prove. He also hated that Wilson refused to call him by his first name, always calling him Chief or Chief Stone.<br><br> Alexia Dragoa, one of the few commercial fishermen who still sailed out of Paradise, was coming from the docks in his ancient F-150.That damned pickup was nearly all rust.The thing was like an old married couple who stayed together more out of habit than any� thing else. No doubt Alexia had been securing his boat, the <i>Dragoa Rainha, </i>in anticipation of the storm. Jesse gave the fisherman a wave in passing. Dragoa, a gruff Portuguese SOB, couldn't be bothered to return the gesture. <i>Par for the course) </i>Jesse thought. <i>Par for the course.<br></i><br> Bill Marchand was out in front of his insurance brokerage on Nan� tucket Street, wrestling the wind for control of a storm shutter. Jesse pulled over to lend him a hand. Bill and Jesse were friendly, if not exactly friends. Jesse didn't have friends, not the way other people had friends. But Marchand &nbsp;sponsored the police softball team and was generous with local charities. In all the years Jesse had served as chief, there hadn't been many town selectmen who'd earned his respect. Most selectmen had proven themselves craven and spineless, rarely backing Jesse or the department in tough situations. Bill Marchand was the exception. He was a thoughtful &nbsp;man who had usually based his support not on the direction of the political currents but on the facts before him.<br><br> "Let me get that for you," Jesse said, pinning the shutter to the wall.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Thanks, Jesse. It's &nbsp;gonna be a bad one, this nor'easter. You been through enough of these, you can smell it on the wind."<br><br> "One is &nbsp;enough of these." Jesse used his free hand to lift up the fleece-lined collar of his jacket against the sleet. The wind was gust� ing more intensely. "Ready for the shutter?" Jesse asked.<br><br> "I've got the latch ready."<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesse forced the shutter closed, Marchand helping the last foot or&nbsp;two. When the shutter was in place, the insurance broker latched it closed.<br><br> "I hope the damned thing holds. I've had to replace these shutters&nbsp;twice," Marchand said, raising his voice above the wind.<br> &nbsp;<br> 'Trn sure your insurance will cover it."<br> &nbsp;<br> "You're a funny man, Jesse Stone. Thanks again," Marchand said, offeringJesse his gloved right hand. "It's gonna be a bad one, all right. I'll be busy for weeks after this. We'll have to call adjusters in from all over the States. You watch yourself out there."<br><br> But it was Jesse's job &nbsp;to watch out for everyone else. He waited for Marchand &nbsp;to get into his massive Infiniti SUV and drive offbefore pulling away himself. <i>As </i>Jesse was about to turn for horne, he caught sight of another vehicle he recognized. It was John Millner's beat-up Chevy van. Millner was a career criminal, a petty thief who'd been in and out of commonwealth correctional facilities during Jesse's tenure as chie� Millner was from the Swap-Southwest Area of Paradise� the only rough part of town. But even the Swap was changing. It was turning into a hipper, more ethnically diverse part of Paradise. Mill� ner's family was old-school Swap and John was more a lowlife than a tough guy. A parasite, an opportunist, not a mastermind.<br><br> Jesse followed the white van at a distance up into the bluffs that overlooked the ocean and the rest of town to the south. The Bluffs were where the rich founders of Paradise had built their big fussy houses more than a &nbsp;century and a half ago. Most of those families were gone, their manses knocked down, properties long since sold off. A few, like the Salter place, remained &nbsp;as summer homes. Many had fallen into disrepair.<br><br> Millner's van pulled off the road by a &nbsp;darkened behemoth &nbsp;of a house: the old Rutherford place. It had been vacant for Jesse's entire tenure in Paradise. For years there had been efforts by the town's his� torical society to get it named to the commonwealth's register of&nbsp;historical places, but those avenues had finally been exhausted, and come spring the Rutherford place would be demolished. Jesse had a pretty good idea of what Millner meant to get up to. Giant old houses were lined with miles of copper wiring and other metals that could be sold off to scrap dealers at good prices. The problem for crooked scav� engers like Millner &nbsp;was opportunity. &nbsp;You needed time to &nbsp;break through plaster walls and lath to get to the wiring. And a big storm had opportunity written all over it. Emergency situations stretched the cops thin, especially small-town forces like the Paradise PD.<br><br> Normally, Jesse would &nbsp;have given Millner enough rope to hang himself. He would have let him break into the condemned house before arresting him, but Jesse didn't have time for that now, not with the storm blowing in. When Millner, all six-foot-six of him, got out of his vehicle and went to swing open the van's side door,Jesse shined his Maglite in the thief's face.<br><br> "Who the hell is that?" asked Millner, holding his hand before his eyes to block the light.<br><br> "It's Chief Stone, John. What are you doing here?"<br> &nbsp;<br> Millner hemmed and hawed, thinking of any reasonable lie. "Don't bother," Jesse said. 'Tm &nbsp;not in the mood for your crap.<br><br> Consider yourself lucky I don't want to deal with youtonight. Now get out of here and don't let any of my people catch your ass &nbsp;up here again."<br><br> Millner didn't say a word, just got back into his van and drove away down toward town. Jesse watched the van's taillights until they disappeared. Then &nbsp;he stepped to the edge of the bluff on which the Rutherford house stood. He looked out at the vast blackness of the Atlantic. He listened to the bones of the old house creak in the wind, listened to the wind whistling through the broken windows. He thought he heard the devil at work. He decided he really needed that drink.<br><br> &nbsp;<br>2<br><br><i>He supposed they were all </i>thinking the same thing: This can't be hap� pening. Not again. Not after all these years. But it <i>was </i>happening, only this time they weren't a bunch of kids with too much Southern Comfort and Thai stick in them. That first time, it was some inno� cent fun gone sideways. Severely sideways, plunging them into a para� lyzing hell with slick, jagged walls from which there would be no escape. None. Not ever. That they were here to kill their old friend proved as much.<br><br> They had been given a temporary reprieve, a cruel reprieve, lasting just long enough to fool them into believing they had put real dis� tance between that old evil and the fragile lives they had built in the meantime. Lives that &nbsp;included wives and lovers, children, careers, small successes, and grander failures, but haunted &nbsp;lives just the same. Haunted because distance from evil is &nbsp;a myth of time, because they&nbsp;were never more than one restless night or, worse still, a tainted moment of joy away from it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> The wind rattled the windows and the loading bay door. The&nbsp;plinking of sleet was less urgent now that the snow was falling in sheets and collecting on the corrugated &nbsp;metal roo� Raw, cold air seeped into the maintenance shed like an accusation and made heav� ing clouds of their breath. Small plumes of breath carne from the mouth of the nude man on the floor at their feet. His wrists and ankles were trussed behind him and his sun-streaked brown hair was caked with the drying blood that had leaked from the welt at &nbsp;the base of his skull. His broken lower jaw was unhinged, his mouth a wreck of splintered teeth and bone. After the pipe had been laid into him, the spray ofblood had given the air a coppery tang that the two other men could almost taste. But the blood had settled out of the air like silt out of water. Now the place smelled only ofburnt black motor oil, gasoline fumes, and antifreeze.<br>&nbsp;<br> "What'd you do with his clothes?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "The furnace in the church." "His duffel bag?"<br>&nbsp;<br> "It's a &nbsp;big furnace. Burnt that up, too. Nothing but old smelly clothes and a Bible, anyways."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Okay, drag that canvas over here and wrap it around his head."<br> &nbsp;<br> "You really gonna do this?"<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>"We </i>are."<br> &nbsp;<br> "But that's Zevon, man. He was our friend once."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Friends don't come back to town to fuck up everyone else's lives. If he wanted to stay my friend, he should have stayed lost. You may not have anything to lose, but I do."<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>"But-"</b><br> &nbsp;<br> "But nothing. We talked this through. We all agreed. It's &nbsp;too late&nbsp;now, anyway. He's already more than &nbsp;half dead. Now get the canvas and do what I told you.The storm's blowing in faster than we thought and he's going to be here soon to get rid of the body. C'mon."<br>&nbsp;<br> The unconscious man moaned a little as the coarse, mildewed fab�ric was wrapped around his head. "What's the canvas for, anyways?" "Think about it."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Oh."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Exactly. You got the tarp ready for him? The rope?" "Yeah."<br><br>Outside there was already six inches on the ground and the roads were slick from the layer of sleet that had come before the snow. As he swung around to back up to the bay door, he checked his rearview mirror and saw two quick flashes of lightning and heard two muted claps of thunder. It was done. Zevon was dead. Now the time had come to play his part in keeping the past buried. Yet he understood that this particular episode of thunder and lightning, like their prior sins, was of their own doing and pushed them even further away from heaven than they already were. That &nbsp;the past was unrelenting and that no grave was deep enough to keep it buried forever.<br><br> &nbsp;<br>3<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>Jesse &nbsp;hadn't slept </i>a wink after getting horne. He hadn't tried. He did manage to polish off two Black Labels. That's why he'd headed horne in the first place. Sleep hadn't ever been a part of the plan, not really. It was always about the drinks. Drinkers are great rationalizers, spin� ning tales that only they will hear. Tales only they would believe.Jesse kept a bottle of something in his desk drawer at the station, but he didn't generally prefer drink at work or when the sun was up. Corning horne, having a drink before dinner, then one or two afterward, was sometimes how he got through the day. He knew his bottle of John� nie Walker was horne waiting for him like a faithful wife. He'd had a wife once, just not a faithful one.<br>&nbsp;<br> His ritual entailed pouring the drink-sometimes on the rocks, sometimes in a tall glass with soda-stirring it with his finger, licking the scotch off his finger, raising a toast to his poster of Ozzie Smith, and taking that first sip. Sometimes he savored it. Sometimes, like&nbsp;that night, it was open wide and down the hatch. Any confirmed drinker knows that ritual is &nbsp;as integral to the addiction as the drink� ing itself. Dix was fond of saying that ritual was a secondary reinforce� ment. Jesse laughed at the notion of secondary reinforcement. He liked the drinking well enough all &nbsp;by itself. He enjoyed the ritual on its own merits. He'd gotten some food in him, taken a shower, and watched a half hour of weather reports before heading back to work.<br> &nbsp;<br>Whatever sleep Jesse had managed carne on the cot in his office. He was still on the cot, staring up at the ceiling, when the first dull rays of light filtered in through his window. He noticed the window was no longer being pelted and the howl of the wind had been reduced to a whisper. Morning had brought with it a soft hush. Then there was a knock at &nbsp;his office door.<br>&nbsp;<br> "Corne," he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luther "Suitcase" Simpson carne into the office, a lack of sleep evi� dent on his puffy, still-boyish face and in his bloodshot eyes. He was moving more slowly these days, and not from lack of sleep. It was painful for Jesse to watch. A big man, Suit had been quite the high school football player in his day. But he'd been gut-shot last spring and was only now getting back to work....</p><h2>No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Box Set: The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Tears of the Giraffe, Morality for Beautiful Girls.</h2><p>The first three books in Alexander MCCall Smith&#39;s beloved bestselling series, featuring Mma Precious Ramotswe, the traditionally built, eminently sensible, cunning proprietor of the only ladies&#39; detective agency in Botswana, are now available in a beautifully designed boxed set.</p><p>The first three books in Alexander MCCall Smith's beloved bestselling series, featuring Mma Precious Ramotswe, the traditionally built, eminently sensible, cunning proprietor of the only ladies' detective agency in Botswana, are now available in a beautifully designed boxed set.<br><br>As an added bonus, the boxed set includes a special edition of the African folktale <i>Milk Bird</i>, retold by Alexander McCall Smith."Smart and sassy. . . .

Preston and Child's <em>Relic</em> and <em>The Cabinet of Curiosities</em> were chosen by readers in a National Public Radio poll as being among the one hundred greatest thrillers ever written, and <em>Relic</em> was made into a number-one box office hit movie. They are coauthors of the famed Pendergast series and their recent novels include<em> Fever Dream</em>, <em>Cold Vengeance</em>, <em>Two Graves</em>, and <em>Gideon's Corpse</em>. In addition to his novels, Preston writes about archaeology for the New Yorker and Smithsonian magazines. Lincoln Child is a former book editor who has published five novels of his own, including the huge bestseller <em>Deep Storm</em>. <br>Readers can sign up for The Pendergast File, a monthly "strangely entertaining note" from the authors, at their website, www.PrestonChild.com. The authors welcome visitors to their alarmingly active Facebook page, where they post regularly.Gideon Crew, the hero of Preston and Child&#x2019;s new novel, has a complicated backstory. As a boy, he watched as his father, who had taken a man hostage, was shot down by a sniper. Less than a decade later, he learned from his mother that his father had been used by the U.S. government as a scapegoat for a failed intelligence project. After dispatching the man responsible for his father&#x2019;s murder, Gideon is offered a job with a private contractor that does hush-hush work for the government. Gideon&#x2019;s mission: to intercept a Chinese scientist and relieve him of the plans for a top-secret weapon. The mission doesn&#x2019;t go as drawn, however, and Gideon is left with a mysterious string of numbers. Now, working mostly alone, he must determine what the numbers mean. This novel (which is apparently the first installment in a new series) isn&#x2019;t as elegantly written or constructed as the authors&#x2019; popular Special Agent Pendergast novels, but it does&#x2014;once you get past the backstory&#x2014;hold the reader&#x2019;s interest, and Gideon is undeniably a big-shouldered character, capable of supporting a series. --David Pitt</p><h2>Star Wars Epic Yarns: The Empire Strikes Back</h2><p>Share your love of <em>Star Wars</em> with your baby!

Used Under Authorization</p><p><i>Star Wars Epic Yarns</i> is a new board book series abridging each movie in the original trilogy in just 12 words and 12 needle-felted images. The series is fun for anyone of any age! <br><br>For the teething set, the books serve as true word primers, since each felt image is paired with a toddler-friendly word such as "sister", "run", "boy", "swing", "fly" or "stop". Because the books trace the main narrative arc of each movie, as children get older, the books become storytelling vehicles. Parents (and kids!) can elaborate on the <i>Star Wars</i> characters and plotlines (and don't be afraid to throw in your best Yoda, Darth Vader or Chewbacca imitation). Even if you're not entirely familiar with the original <i>Star Wars</i> movies, there's no "wrong" way to read <i>Star Wars Epic Yarns</i>. You or your child can just make up the story! The point is to make the reading experience fun and exciting. And finally, for teens and adults, <i>Star Wars Epic Yarns</i> serves as a humorous and ironic piece of fan memorabilia, perfect for the coffee table to stir up nostalgia for movie-going days gone by.<br><br>The primary technique for making the figures in <i>Star Wars Epic Yarns</i> is needle felting, which is essentially sculpting with wool. This is a painstaking process which involves stabbing loose wool thousands of times with a specialized barbed needle. This entangles the wool fibers, making the wool firmer and firmer. It took us nearly a year to create all the <i>Star Wars</i> figures and spaceships in wool, build all the scale-model sets, and do all the in-studio or on location photography. We even flew to California and Arizona to find real desert to recreate the scenes on Tatooine! As lifelong <i>Star Wars</i> fans, it was important to us to get the books just right. Think of <i>Star Wars Epic Yarns</i> as the ultimate, year-long craft project! It was definitely a labor of love.<br><br>We hope you have as much fun reading and sharing the books as we had in making them.

Visit her website at www.tessgerritsen.com.Dr. Maura Isles had not smelled fresh air all day. Since seven that morning she had been inhaling the scent of death, an aroma so familiar to her that she did not recoil as her knife sliced cold skin, as foul odors wafted up from exposed organs. The police officers who occasionally stood in the room to observe postmortems were not so stoic. Sometimes Maura caught a whiff of the Vicks ointment that they dabbed in their nostrils to mask the stench. Sometimes even Vicks was not enough, and she&#x2019;d see them suddenly go wobbly and turn away, to gag over the sink. Cops were not accustomed, as she was, to the astringent bite of formalin, the sulfurous aroma of decaying membranes.<br><br>Today, there was an incongruous note of sweetness added to that bouquet of odors: the scent of coconut oil, emanating from the skin of Mrs. Gloria Leder, who now lay on the autopsy table. She was fifty years old, a divorcee with broad hips and heavy breasts and toenails painted a brilliant pink. Deep tan lines marked the edges of the bathing suit she had been wearing when she was found dead beside her apartment swimming pool. It had been a bikini&#x2014;not the most flattering choice for a body sagging with middle age. When was the last time I had the chance to put on my bathing suit? Maura thought, and she felt an absurd flash of envy for Mrs. Gloria Leder, who&#x2019;d spent the last moments of her life enjoying this summer day. It was almost August, and Maura had not yet visited the beach or sat by a swimming pool or even sunbathed in her own backyard.<br><br>&#x201c;Rum and Coke,&#x201d; said the young cop standing at the foot of the table. &#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s what she had in her glass. It was sitting next to her patio chair.&#x201d;<br><br>This was the first time Maura had seen Officer Buchanan in her morgue. He made her nervous, the way he kept fussing with his paper mask and shifting from foot to foot. The boy looked way too young to be a cop. They were all starting to look too young.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you retain the contents of that glass?&#x201d; she asked Officer Buchanan.<br><br>&#x201c;Uh . . . no, ma&#x2019;am. I took a good whiff. She was definitely drinking a rum and Coke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At nine A.M.?&#x201d; Maura looked across the table at her assistant, Yoshima. As usual, he was silent, but she saw one dark eyebrow tilt up, as eloquent a comment as she would get from Yoshima.<br><br>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t get down too much of it,&#x201d; said Officer Buchanan.<br><br>&#x201c;The glass was still pretty full.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Maura. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take a look at her back.&#x201d;<br><br>Together, she and Yoshima log-rolled the corpse onto its side.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a tattoo here on the hip,&#x201d; noted Maura. &#x201c;Little blue butterfly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Geez,&#x201d; said Buchanan. &#x201c;A woman her age?&#x201d;<br><br>Maura glanced up. &#x201c;You think fifty&#x2019;s ancient, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean&#x2014;well, that&#x2019;s my <i>mom&#x2019;s </i>age.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Careful, boy. I&#x2019;m only ten years younger.<br><br></i>She picked up the knife and began to cut. This was her fifth postmortem of the day, and she made swift work of it. With Dr. Costas on vacation, and a multivehicle accident the night before, the cold room had been crammed with body bags that morning. Even as she&#x2019;d worked her way through the backlog, two more bodies had been delivered to the refrigerator. Those would have to wait until tomorrow. The morgue&#x2019;s clerical staff had already left for the evening, and Yoshima kept looking at the clock, obviously anxious to be on his way home.<br><br>She incised skin, gutted the thorax and abdomen. Removed dripping organs and placed them on the cutting board to be sectioned. Little by little, Gloria Leder revealed her secrets: a fatty liver, the telltale sign of a few too many rums and Cokes. A uterus knobby with fibroids.<br><br>And finally, when they opened the cranium, the reason for her death. Maura saw it as she lifted the brain in her gloved hands. &#x201c;Subarachnoid hemorrhage,&#x201d; she said, and glanced up at Buchanan. He was looking far paler than when he had first walked into the room. &#x201c;This woman probably had a berry aneurysm&#x2014;a weak spot in one of the arteries at the base of the brain. Hypertension would have exacerbated it.&#x201d;<br><br>Buchanan swallowed, his gaze focused on the flap of loose skin that had been Gloria Leder&#x2019;s scalp, now peeled forward over the face. That&#x2019;s the part that usually horrified them, the point at which so many of them winced or turned away&#x2014;when the face collapses like a tired rubber mask.<br><br>&#x201c;So . . . you&#x2019;re saying it&#x2019;s a natural death?&#x201d; he asked softly.<br><br>&#x201c;Correct. There&#x2019;s nothing more you need to see here.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man was already stripping off his gown as he retreated from the table. &#x201c;I think I need some fresh air . . .&#x201d;<br><br>So do I, thought Maura. It&#x2019;s a summer night, my garden needs watering, and I have not been outside all day.<br><br>But an hour later she was still in the building, sitting at her desk reviewing lab slips and dictated reports. Though she had changed out of her scrub suit, the smell of the morgue still seemed to cling to her, a scent that no amount of soap and water could eradicate, because the memory itself was what lingered. She picked up the Dictaphone and began to record her report on Gloria Leder.<br><br>&#x201c;Fifty-year-old white woman found slumped in a patio chair near her apartment swimming pool. She is a well-developed, wellnourished woman with no visible trauma. External exam reveals an old surgical scar on her abdomen, probably from an appendectomy. There is a small tattoo of a butterfly on her . . .&#x201d; She paused, picturing the tattoo. Was it on the left or the right hip? God, I&#x2019;m so tired, she thought. I can&#x2019;t remember. What a trivial detail. It made no difference to her conclusions, but she hated being inaccurate.<br><br>She rose from her chair and walked the deserted hallway to the stairwell, where her footfalls echoed on concrete steps. Pushing into the lab, she turned on the lights and saw that Yoshima had left the room in pristine condition as usual, the tables wiped down and gleaming, the floors mopped clean. She crossed to the cold room and pulled open the heavy locker door. Wisps of cold mist curled out. She took in a reflexive breath of air, as though about to plunge into foul water, and stepped into the locker.<br><br>Eight gurneys were occupied; most were awaiting pickup by funeral homes. Moving down the row, she checked the tags until she found Gloria Leder&#x2019;s. She unzipped the bag, slipped her hands under the corpse&#x2019;s buttocks and rolled her sideways just far enough to catch a glimpse of the tattoo.<br><br>It was on the left hip.<br><br>She closed the bag again and was just about to swing the door shut when she froze. Turning, she stared into the cold room.<br><br><i>Did I just hear something?<br><br></i>The fan came on, blowing icy air from the vents. Yes, that&#x2019;s all it was, she thought. The fan. Or the refrigerator compressor. Or water cycling in the pipes. It was time to go home. She was so tired, she was starting to imagine things.<br><br>Again she turned to leave.<br><br>Again she froze. Turning, she stared at the row of body bags. Her heart was thumping so hard now, all she could hear was the beat of her own pulse.<br><br><i>Something moved in here. I&#x2019;m sure of it.<br><br></i>She unzipped the first bag and stared down at a man whose chest had been sutured closed. Already autopsied, she thought. Definitely dead.<br><br><i>Which one? Which one made the noise?<br><br></i>She yanked open the next bag, and confronted a bruised face, a shattered skull. <i>Dead.<br><br></i>With shaking hands she unzipped the third bag. The plastic parted, and she saw the face of a pale young woman with black hair and cyanotic lips. Opening the bag all the way, she exposed a wet blouse, the fabric clinging to white flesh, the skin glistening with chilly droplets of water. She peeled open the blouse and saw full breasts, a slim waist. The torso was still intact, not yet incised by the pathologist&#x2019;s knife. The fingers and toes were purple, the arms marbled with blue.<br><br>She pressed her fingers to the woman&#x2019;s neck and felt icy skin. Bending close to the lips, she waited for the whisper of a breath, the faintest puff of air against her cheek.<br><br>The corpse opened its eyes.<br><br>Maura gasped and lurched backward. She collided with the gurney behind her, and almost fell as the wheels rolled away. She scrambled back to her feet and saw that the woman&#x2019;s eyes were still open, but unfocused. Blue-tinged lips formed soundless words.<br><br><i>Get her out of the refrigerator! Get her warm!<br><br></i>Maura shoved the gurney toward the door but it didn&#x2019;t budge; in her panic she&#x2019;d forgotten to unlock the wheels. She stamped down on the release lever and pushed again. This time it rolled, rattling out of the cold room into the warmer loading area.<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s eyes had drifted shut again. Leaning close, Maura could feel no air moving past the lips. <i>Oh Jesus. I can&#x2019;t lose you now.<br><br></i>She knew nothing about this stranger&#x2014;not her name, nor her medical history. This woman could be teeming with viruses, yet she sealed her mouth over the woman&#x2019;s, and almost gagged at the taste of chilled flesh. She delivered three deep breaths, and pressed her fingers to the neck to check for a carotid pulse.<br><br><i>Am I imagining it? Is that my own pulse I feel, throbbing in my fingers?<br><br></i>She grabbed the wall phone and dialed 911.<br><br>&#x201c;Emergency operator.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is Dr. Isles in the medical examiner&#x2019;s office. I need an ambulance. There&#x2019;s a woman here, in respiratory arrest&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me, did you say the medical examiner&#x2019;s office?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes! I&#x2019;m at the rear of the building, just inside the loading bay.

A gripping, deeply evocative thriller about the devastating secrets surrounding a little girl lost, featuring the popular detective team of Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, <em>Gone, Baby, Gone </em>was the basis for the critically acclaimed motion picture directed by Ben Affleck and starring Casey Affleck, Ed Harris, and Morgan Freeman.</p></p><p>Cheese Olamon, "a six-foot-two, four-hundred-and-thirty-pound yellow-haired Scandinavian who'd somehow arrived at the misconception he was black," is telling his old grammar school friends Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro why they have to convince another mutual chum, the gun dealer Bubba Rugowski, that Cheese didn't try to have him killed. "You let Bubba know I'm clean when it comes to what happened to him. You want me alive. Okay? Without me, that girl will be gone. Gone-gone. You understand? Gone, baby, gone." Of all the chilling, completely credible scenes of sadness, destruction, and betrayal in Dennis Lehane's fourth and very possibly best book about Kenzie and Gennaro, this moment stands out because it captures in a few pages the essence of Lehane's success. <p> Private detectives Kenzie and Gennaro, who live in the same working-class Dorchester neighborhood of Boston where they grew up, have gone to visit drug dealer Cheese in prison because they think he's involved in the kidnapping of 4-year-old Amanda McCready. Without sentimentalizing the grotesque figure of Cheese, Lehane tells us enough about his past to make us understand why he and the two detectives might share enough trust to possibly save a child's life when all the best efforts of traditional law enforcement have failed. By putting Kenzie and Gennaro just to one side of the law (but not totally outside; they have several cop friends, a very important part of the story), Lehane adds depth and edge to traditional genre relationships. The lifelong love affair between Kenzie and Gennaro--interrupted by her marriage to his best friend--is another perfectly controlled element that grows and changes as we watch. Surrounded by dead, abused, and missing children, Kenzie mourns and rages while Gennaro longs for one of her own. So the choices made by both of them in the final pages of this absolutely gripping story have the inevitability of life and the dazzling beauty of art. </p><p> Other Kenzie/Gennaro books available in paperback: <i>Darkness, Take My Hand</i>, <i>A Drink Before the War</i>, <i>Sacred</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Boston private detectives Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro are hired to find four-year-old Amanda McCready, abducted from her bed on a warm, summer night. They meet her stoned-out, strangely apathetic mother, her loving aunt and uncle, the mother's dangerous, drug-addled friends, and two cops who've found so many abused or dead children they may be too far over the edge to come back. Despite enormous public attention, rabid news coverage, and dogged police work, the investigation repeatedly hits a brick wall. Led into a world of drug dealers, child molesters, and merciless executioners, Patrick and Angie are soon forced to face not only the horrors adults can perpetrate on innocents but also their own conflicted feelings about what is best, and worst, when it comes to raising children. And as the Indian summer fades and the autumn chill deepens, Amanda McCready stays gone, banished so completely that she seems never to have existed.<p></p><strong>Then another child disappears. . . . </strong><p>Dennis Lehane takes you into a world of triple crosses, elaborate lies, and shrouded motives, where the villains may be more moral than the victims, the missing should possibly stay missing, and those who go looking for them may not come back alive.</p><p>Settle in and turn off the phone. From its haunting opening to its shocking climax, <em>Gone, Baby, Gone</em> is certain to be one of the most thrilling, talked-about suspense novels you read this year.</p><p></p></p><h2>NIV Childrens Bible</h2><p>This special children&#39;s edition of the best-selling New International Version (NIV) Bible gives kids a &#39;grown-up&#39; Bible -- but one with child friendly features: a winsome cover design, a Bible dictionary, a colorful presentation page, record pages, timeline, maps, and 32 delightfully realistic full-color illustrations by artist Nancy Munger.</p><p></p><h2>101 More Hymn Stories: The Inspiring True Stories Behind 101 Favorite Hymns</h2><p>(Foreword by Cliff Barrows) More inspiring stories behind the hymns of past and contemporary favorites.</p><p><b>Kenneth W.

What interests me first about these stores is what titles are being displayed in the 'Staff Recommends' section of the store. It is here that you can find treasured, beloved books quite dear to someone who works in the stores, someone waiting quite eagerly for the chance to hand sell their recommended titles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these Staff Recommend sections that I kept on seeing our Penman's titles, HERE BE DRAGONS, FALLS THE SHADOW, THE RECKONING and also SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR and WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT.<br>It's funny, you can sell something for years before you notice that the author has been quietly making a powerful impact on people everywhere.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started with HERE BE DRAGONS and I have never looked back. Her trilogy of the decline of the Welsh kings ( DRAGON, FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING)is a holiday gift I give year after year, and I'm happy to say they have always been embraced and loved. From my 15 year old niece to my 70 year old mother and many ages in between, all readers are enchanted and transported to a land and an age gone forever. But Penman makes them live forever in our minds and hearts with fantastic, unforgettable characters and wonderful history. HERE BE DRAGONS is such a great title--medieval mapmakes would write those words across any part of the map that was unknown.. a wonderful metaphor for how little the Welsh and English knew of each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR--Warning: This is not Shakespeare's Richard III. In this novel, Richard is a victim of circumstance and man vilified by the Tudors, but here presented as a decent and normal man, a man of conscience.<br>AND he is not a murderer. Yes, those princes did die, but not by Richard's hand.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT<p>Another wonderful title, for it refers to the 15 years of England's darkest time-the civil war between the cousins Queen Maud and King Steven. England was deserted, for Christ and his saints were sleeping. I had never even heard of these royals. Queen Maud was the legitimate heir to the throne, but a woman, and there fore not fit to rule. She is also the mother of Henry, who later married Eleanor of Aquitaine . Pretty heady stuff, more incredible men and women, another book to get totally lost in. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been years since all these books were first published, I can name 5 stores I have been in in the past 3 months that have one of these titles in the Staff Recommends section.<br><br>-Alice Kesterson, Ballantine Regional Sales Manger</p>ader is left with the haunting sensation that perhaps the good a man does can live after him--especially in the hands of a dedicated historian."<br>SAN DIEGO UNION<br>In this stirring historical novel, Sharon Kay Penman redeems Richard III from his villainous role in history as the hulking, evil hunchback. This dazzling recreation of his life is filled with the sights and sounds of battle, and the passions of the highborn. Most of all, it brings to life a gifted man whose greatest sin was that he held principles too firmly for the times in which he lived, and loved too deeply to survive love's loss.</p><h2>The Old Testament Made Easier, Vol. 3 (Gospel Study)</h2><p>&#x201c;A Teacher in Your Hand!&#x201d; In this study guide, noted teacher and gospel scholar David J.

A longtime writer of children&#39;s stories, she sold her first book for adults in 1982. She and her husband now live on a ranch in New Mexico with a variety of animals.Tepper's finest novel to date is set in a post-holocaust feminist dystopia that offers only two political alternatives: a repressive polygamist sect that is slowly self-destructing through inbreeding and the matriarchal dictatorship called Women's Country. Here, in a desperate effort to prevent another world war, the women have segregated most men into closed military garrisons and have taken on themselves every other function of government, industry, agriculture, science and learning. The resulting manifold responsibilities are seen through the life of Stavia, from a dreaming 10-year-old to maturity as doctor, mother and member of the Marthatown Women's Council. As in Tepper's Awakeners series books, the rigid social systems are tempered by the voices of individual experience and, here, by an imaginative reworking of The Trojan Woman that runs through the text.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.<p><strong>I</strong><br>I&#x2019;d just applied the thinnest coat possible of a satin finish on the black oak wardrobe for the autarch of Kyphros--Kasee--when I felt the presence of horses, and their riders. Krystal was not with them, and I didn&#x2019;t like the idea of the Finest tramping up to the shop without my consort, but as subcommander of the autarch&#x2019;s forces, Krystal&#x2019;s schedule wasn&#x2019;t exactly predictable.<br>I finished the section of the wardrobe I had been working on before I met the troopers outside the stable. The stable hadn&#x2019;t been my idea, but Krystal&#x2019;s, and she had paid for most of it, especially the part that doubled as a bunkhouse for her personal guard. Funny things like that happen to the consort of the second-highest-ranking military officer in Kyphros, not that either of us had planned where we would end up when we-and Tamra and a few others--had been thrown out of Recluce years earlier because we hadn&#x2019;t been &#x201c;ordered&#x201d; enough for the black Brotherhood--or my father.<br>&#x201c;Greetings, Order-master!&#x201d; In the green leathers of the autarch&#x2019;s Finest, Yelena sat easily on the brown gelding.<br>I&#x2019;d known Yelena from my first days in Kyphrien, when I&#x2019;d been fortunate to best the white chaos-master Antonin and rescue Tamra. Yelena had been my escort part of the way on that troubled trip, but she still called me order-master and threatened to lash any member of the Finest who even hinted at any familiarity. If she weren&#x2019;t so serious about it, it might have been funny, but I understood her reasoning,- and couldn&#x2019;t say it was wrong. People had this idea that I was a great wizard because I&#x2019;d managed to get rid of three white wizards. One of them had actually plagued not only Kyphros, but all of the continent of Candar.<br>&#x201c;Greetings, Leader Yelena.&#x201d;<br>She wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that smell?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a satin-finish varnish-except it&#x2019;s got a touch of some other things that make it more like--&#x2019;&#x2019;<br>&#x201c;Enough, enough...&#x201d; The broad-shouldered squad leader grinned as she dismounted. &#x201c;Until I met you, I always thought woodworkers were small little men who hid in their shops, toiling endless days in the dark until they produced something like magic.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have the endless-days part correct, and I&#x2019;m not that big.&#x201d;<br>She shook her head. So I am a bit taller than the average Kyphran, who tend to be shorter and darker than people from the north or from the island continent of Reduce. That didn&#x2019;t make me that big a person.<br>&#x201c;Where is Krystal?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The subcommander is meeting with the autarch, and will be here shortly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So, why are you here?&#x201d; I looked down at the varnish-stained cloth in my hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to get back to the wardrobe, or I&#x2019;ll have the demon&#x2019;s own time getting the finish to match.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br>&#x201c;Commander Ferrel wanted to make sure that no one disturbed the subcommander.&#x201d;<br>That didn&#x2019;t make much sense. If Ferrel didn&#x2019;t want Krystal disturbed, why weren&#x2019;t the guards with her?<br>&#x201c;How many for dinner, Master Lends?&#x201d; Rissa was still barefoot and wore trousers that looked more like shorts. I&#x2019;d given up on correcting her, but I had noticed that she only used the term &#x201c;master&#x2019;&#x201d; when others were present. Rissa had grown up not far from the burned-out buildings I&#x2019;d received from the autarch and rebuilt, but Yelena had rescued Rissa from bandits who killed Rissa&#x2019;s consort and daughter not long after we moved in. Rissa hadn&#x2019;t spoken at first, but my uncle Justen--the only true gray wizard in Candar, or perhaps anywhere--had been convinced that being around Krystal and me would heal her. Besides, at the time, Justen had had his hands full in rebuilding Tamra&#x2019;s abilities and confidence after her near disastrous encounter with Antonin when the white wizard Sephya had taken over Tamra&#x2019;s body.<br>So...I&#x2019;d done what I could for Rissa, and so had Krystal, and it had gotten to be nice to have someone else do the cooking and cleaning. That way, I could concentrate on setting up my workshop and getting customers. Krystal was a good cook, not that she ever had any time for it, being the chief military trainer and administrator of Kyphros. I still was a bit amazed, when I thought about it, that Kyphros, like ancient Westwind, was run basically by women. Unlike Westwind, they didn&#x2019;t run out men or tromp all over them. It just happened that in Kyphros, most of the people with the ability to govern seemed to be women. That was fine with me, since I never had any inclinations along those lines.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s off somewhere, again,&#x201c; snorted Rissa. &#x201c;Master Lerris...dinner? How many?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How would I know?&#x201d; I turned to Yelena. &#x201c;How many do you have?&#x201d;<br>Yelena frowned gently. &#x201c;We ate before we left, and they have their rations.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Would you join us? And why aren&#x2019;t you with the subcommander?&#x201d; Was Krystal being sent off somewhere else again?<br>&#x201c;Not tonight. The subcommander told me to tell you that the wizard Justen and his apprentice would be arriving with her.&#x201d;<br>I took a deep breath. As usual, things were getting complicated. Krystal had been out for the past eight-day, doing something with the local levies around Ruzor, and I&#x2019;d hoped to have some time with her. Now the whole world was arriving. Yelena, who usually joined us, even if her troops didn&#x2019;t, wasn&#x2019;t going to, and that meant something worse was about to happen.<br>Yelena smiled gently, understanding my thoughts.<br>&#x201c;Five, so far. And make sure we have some ale for Justen.&#x201d;<br>Rissa shook her head and padded back into the house.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;--to get back to your finish. I am sure I wouldn&#x2019;t wish to spoil a piece meant for the autarch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How did you know?&#x2019;&#x2019;<br>She shrugged, turned, and motioned to Weldein and Freyda and two others I didn&#x2019;t know. Weldein grinned at me, and I gave him an exaggerated shrug.<br>As I turned back to the shop, I wondered, not for the first time, how anything could be kept a secret in Kyphros. Inside, I took a fresh cloth and dipped it into the finish and began to rub it into the wood. &#x201c;Rub&#x201d; is really the wrong term, because there&#x2019;s almost no pressure involved. The finish I had cooked up was thin and took a long time to dry. I needed to apply several coats, but the eventual result was a hard, but almost invisible coat--without magic--and that was what I&#x2019;d wanted with the wardrobe, because the doors generally took a beating.<br>The inlaid design glistened and seemed to stand out from the dark wood. Inlay work was, for me, the hardest part. Not the grooving or the channels in the base wood--that was a matter of patience and care--but the creation of the inlay pieces themselves. The grain has to add to the design and not just appear as though it had been stuck there any old way. I also tended to make my inlays a shade deeper, but that meant ensuring that the base wood was fractionally thicker to avoid sacrificing strength.<br>The design was a variation on the autarch&#x2019;s flag--an olive branch crossed with a blade--golden oak set in the base, black oak on the panel above the doors. That was it--nothing else to mar the smooth finish of the piece. That sort of work is tricky, because any flaw is instantly noticed. Errors in more elaborate inlays often aren&#x2019;t seen.<br>I was probably extra sensitive to flaws in woodworking, and in wood, because one little flaw when I was working as an apprentice for my uncle Sardit had gotten me exiled from Reduce, carted across the Eastern Ocean and dumped in Candar to discover the &#x201c;truth&#x201d; of order, with only a staff, except it was a special staff, bound in order and black iron. Because I was a potential order-master, one of the so-called blackstaffers, no one had told me much, and I had gotten into more and more trouble. I&#x2019;d been chased out of Freetown, chased out of Hris-barg, and generally on the run across Eastern Candar until I ran into Justen. Then, I&#x2019;d thought he was just a gray wizard, and I was glad to be his apprentice. It took me more than a year to find out he was my uncle--and well over two centuries old. So I&#x2019;d ridden with Justen, almost gotten possessed by one of the white wizards bound centuries earlier in the ruins of Frven. Justen saved me there, and then had taught me how to heal sheep, and a few other things. Nothing went quite as planned. I&#x2019;d rescued and healed a street slut in Jellico. That hadn&#x2019;t been such a good idea, because all unlicensed healing there was forbidden, and I&#x2019;d had to leave Justen and, once again, ride for my life, heading west across Candar.<br>Eventually, I&#x2019;d gotten through the Easthorns--through storms and snows in those towering mountains--and made my way to Fenard--the capital of Gallos. I actually found a place with a woodworker, old Destrin, and got back to working wood. There I lasted about a year before I did something else stupid--I infused some chairs we made with extra order. The extra order reacted with the chaos in the Prefect&#x2019;s officers, and some were burned. That meant I had to leave Gallos, but not until I&#x2019;d found a suitable match for Destrin&#x2019;s daughter Deirdre.<br>At that point, Gallos and Kyphros were fighting an ugly war, fomented and fueled by Antonin, one of the nastier white wizards I&#x2019;d ever had the displeasure of running across. I&#x2019;d found out that Krystal had joined the forces of the autarch of Kyphros. So I went to Kyphrien, the capital of Kyphros, to see if I could help, although my skills were certainly weak compared to those of Antonin.<br>After rescuing some of Commander Fend&#x2019;s Finest and disposing of one white...</p></p><h2>Abortion: A Rational Look at an Emotional Issue</h2><p>In this book, Dr. R.C. Sproul employs his unique perspective as a highly experienced pastor-theologian and a trained philosopher to provide well-considered and compassionate answers to the difficult questions that attend termination of pregnancy. Dr. Sproul strives for a factual, well-reasoned approach informed by careful biblical scholarship. He considers both sides of this issue in terms of biblical teaching, civil law, and natural law. This edition includes a new foreword by Dr. George Grant and has been updated to reflect developments in the issue of abortion. Appendixes provide further background on the issue of when life begins and list sources for pro-life resources.</p><p>Dr. R.C. Sproul is founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries, an international Christian education ministry located near Orlando, Fla. He is also co-pastor of Saint Andrew s Chapel in Sanford, Fla., chancellor of Reformation Bible College, and executive editor of Tabletalk magazine. He can be heard on the radio program Renewing Your Mind, which is broadcast on hundreds of radio outlets in the United States and around the world. Dr. Sproul has contributed dozens of articles to national evangelical publications, has spoken at conferences, churches, and schools around the world, and has written more than ninety books, including The Holiness of God, Faith Alone, and Everyone&#39;s a Theologian. He also serves as general editor of The Reformation Study Bible.<p>Classic Sproul! Logical, clear, fair, attempting to understand the pro-choice view while all the time making a solid, biblical pro-life apologetic that seeks both to convince the opponents but also to bring about in practical ways the end of this North American holocaust. Add to that the forward of George Grant and you have a winner.</p> --Peter Jones: Executive director, truthXchange Escondido, California<br><br><p>R.C. Sproul covers the issues candidly and objectively-without the emotion and demagoguery that so often pervade the abortion debate. You are the jury; decide the verdict.</p> --John MacArthur: Pastor-teacher, Grace Community Church Sun Valley, California<br><br><p>When I read R.C. Sproul's book on abortion twenty years ago, I was still a pastor. I recall how grateful I was that a respected theologian had spoken out so clearly on the critical issue of abortion. At the time, such voices were few and far between, with many evangelical theologians seeming silent about the plight of unborn children. Sproul's logic is sharp and penetrating, and his reliance on biblical authority is refreshing. The appendix, in which Dr. Jerome Lejeune offers courtroom testimony, is a great bonus. I'm happy to recommend the re-release of Dr. Sproul's book on this vital subject, and I pray God will use it to enlighten many new readers.</p> --Randy Alcorn: Founder and director, Eternal Perspective Ministries Sandy, Oregon</p><h2>The African American Heritage Cookbook: Traditional Recipes and Fond Remembrances from Alabama&#39;s Renowned Tuskegee Institute</h2><p>Includes memories and literary passages that evince the spirit of Tuskegee and complement more than two hundred traditional recipes with pictorial accounts, personal vignettes, and poetry.</p><p><b>Carolyn Quick Tillery</b> is a Tuskegee Institute alumna, a former Air Force officer and prosecuting attorney.

She has written twenty books including the Arthurian novel <i>Hallowed Isle</i>.Go back to the second century A.D., when Rome influences all and the "old" religions are struggling to keep their foothold in Britain. The Priestess, who is from the royal House of Avalon, that mysterious island shrouded in mists and magic, marries Flavius Valerius Constantius, who becomes a Roman Emperor, and she becomes the mother of Constantine. As we learn about Roman history, we also see Christianity grasp and then hold sway in the world. Bradley and Paxson add flavor and beauty to this chaotic time in the Roman Empire. Davina Porter tells this first-person tale in voices that alternate between soft and imperial, with slight variations for the men. She brings the magic and mystery to the surface with gentle intonation and fluid narration. As Roman history and Christianity make their marks on the world, Avalon seeks to keep its mists and with them the strength of alternate beliefs about the nature of the world.

Like most SUV owners in Colorado, he bought the vehicle primarily for winter driving. But one summer day, he saw an intriguing dirt road that headed into the mountains. Off he went on his first real trip beyond the pavement. It was so much fun, he searched for other roads to duplicate the experience. Many more trips followed. As his confidence grew, he ventured farther and farther into the backcountry. He realized he needed some guidance, so he bought every guidebook and map he could find. Unfortunately, most of the information was vague, incomplete or inaccurate. He continued to get lost, run into places too difficult for his vehicle and waste time on boring roads. This frustration led him to write his first book, Guide to Colorado Backroads &amp; 4-Wheel Drive Trails, in 1998. Sales took off, immediately. Within a year, he quit his job and started FunTreks Publishing. Many years later, Wells has published eleven books (two were replaced by new editions). His books include easy and moderate routes for stock SUVs, difficult trails for serious 4-wheelers and trails for unlicensed vehicles (ATVs, UTVs and dirt bikes). Today his books are standard equipment for thousands of motorized adventurers. He strongly promotes responsible use of public lands.Charles continues to scout most of the trails and spends a great deal of time traveling in his motorhome. His books presently cover Colorado, Utah, Arizona and California. More states are planned. Wells graduated from Ohio State University in 1969 with a degree in graphic design. After practicing design in Ohio, he moved to Colorado Springs in 1980 and worked 18 years in the printing business. He and his wife, Beverly, have two adult children and 4 grandchildren. They now live in Monument, CO, close to their business. Matt (PT) Peterson got into 4-wheeling in 2000 after graduating from college. He built several off-road 4x4s starting with bolt parts, and later progressed to custom-built, off-road buggies. Wanting to share his new pastime, he and a few friends started their own 4-wheel-drive club in Michigan and the club is still going strong today. He has always had an interest in exploring less-traveled roads and was overjoyed when he moved to Colorado in 2003.He worked many years as a graphic designer and computer technician, then joined FunTreks in 2008. He currently scouts trails, then helps Wells write and produce the books. Peterson graduated from Bethel College in 2000 with a degree in graphic design. He met his wife, Cassie, soon after moving to Colorado. Together, they enjoy camping and other outdoor activities in Colorado's enormous backyard.</p><h2>Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness</h2><p>This is a new edition. Updated in 2016 by Lama Shenpen Hookham. Progressive stages of meditation on emptiness (Tib. stong nyid sgom rim) is a series of meditation practices on a particular aspect of the Buddha&#x2019;s teachings. The idea is that by beginning with one&#x2019;s first rather coarse common sense understanding, one progresses through increasingly subtle and more refined stages until one arrives at complete and perfect understanding. Each stage in the process prepares the mind for the next in so far as each step is fully integrated into one&#x2019;s understanding through the meditation process. &#x201c;The Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness is a signature teaching and systematic method of instruction taught by my amazing guru, Khenchen Ts�ltrim Gyamtso Rinpoche. Profound and concise, it is a transformative way for sincere students at any level of study to connect with the experience of shunyata. Lama Shenpen Hookham's skillful presentation of Rinpoche's teaching on these progressive stages so many years ago has been a great and enduring gift to the dharma world. I am delighted by this revised edition, which will benefit all who take its pithy wisdom to heart&#x201d; - Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche &#x201c;Khenpo Rinpoche&#x2019;s text, expertly translated and arranged by Lama Shenpen Hookham, is an eminently practical tool to familiarize ourselves with the notoriously difficult Buddhist notion of emptiness through a gradual approach and make it a personal experience in all its facets&#x201d; - Karl Brunnholzl</p><p>The Venerable Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche came to Europe at the request of H.H. 16th Karmapa in 1977. He is one of the most erudite scholars and accomplished yogins of the Karma Kagyu lineage of our day. He is especially well-known for his breadth of vision and the clarity of his Dharma expositions. While he unites prodigious scholarship with great compassion, he also embodies the training and temperament of a true yogin. In fact he is often compared to the great yogin Milarepa. Like him he is known for his spontaneous songs of realization. For decades he travelled around the world teaching wherever he was invited leaving an indelible impression on many sanghas. At the same time in conjunction with Thrangu Rinpoche he was training the next generation of Kagyu tulkus and khenpos at the Nalanda Institute for Higher Studies in Rumtek, Sikkim. He also founded and continues to support nunneries in Tibet, Bhutan and Nepal. These are just a few of the things he has accomplished in his life. For more information go to his website - marpafoundation.org. Lama Shenpen Hookham had already studied and practised in retreat in India and Nepal under the direction of Kagyu Lamas for ten years before meeting Ven. Khenpo Gyamtso Rinpoche in 1977. She first met Trungpa Rinpoche in 1967 and followed his suggestion to go to India to take meditation instruction from Karma Thinley Rinpoche. When Karma Thinley Rinpoche left for Canada, she studied with Kalu Rinpoche and Bokar Rinpoche until in 1975 HH Karmapa asked her to return to the West to teach. She acted as Gendun Rinpoche&#x2019;s translator in France for a number of years until Khenpo Rinpoche directed her to take her place at Oxford University where, in 1986, she completed her doctoral thesis on Tathagatagarbha doctrine according to the Shentong interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga, published under the title of &#x2018;The Buddha Within&#x2019; by SUNY 1991. She married Michael Hookham (now known as Rigdzin Shikpo) in 1972. Khenpo Rinpoche encouraged Shenpen to establish the Awakened Heart Sangha and take charge of students as their Lama. This is now a worldwide spiritual community based in the UK. She spends most of her time in semi-retreat and in training her students.

Ages 8-12.</p><p>Dave and Neta Jackson, husband and wife writing team, are the authors or coauthors of more than 120 books that have sold over 2.5 million copies. They are best known for the 40-volume Trailblazer Books series for young readers and the Hero Tales series for families.

Sent to live with relatives after his father is killed during the War of 1812 and his mother is carried off by Sauk warriors, Gil grows up longing to find his mother and be part of a family again. By joining Methodist circuit-rider Peter Cartwright on his trip to start new missions in the West, Gil finally gets an opportunity to search. But when he locates his mother, he discovers she now has a new life in the tribe, with a husband and children she cannot abandon. Believing his dreams of a family life are not meant to be, he returns to Cartwright and, with the man's guidance, comes to accept God as his Father and Heaven as his home. Part of the Trailblazer Books series, which is intended to introduce children to Christian heroes in history, this gives young readers a glimpse of Cartwright's impact on Illinois politics and religious development. It will, however, be Gil's heroic struggle to find his mother and, in turn, find himself that children remember the most. <i>Lois Schultz</i></p><h2>Whatever Became of Sin?</h2><p>The distinguished psychiatrist examines human morality and the existence and consequences of sin today</p><p></p><h2>Catflexing: The Catlover&#39;s Guide to Weight Training, Aerobics and Stretching</h2><p>Combines weight lifting, aerobics, and stretching into a routine that a cat and its owner can share, and includes advice on both human and cat nutrition</p><p></p><h2>for Book-Collectors</h2><p>Eighth edition, completely revised and re-set, with additional information and an Introduction by Nicolas Barker.

As we draw closer to Him, we must choose to let go of other &#34;less-wild lovers,&#34; such as perfectionistic driveness and self-indulgence. Eldredge and Curtis identify the lies offered by &#34;false loves&#34; and instruct us on the journey back to the Lover of our souls.In carefully crafted words and images, the authors entice the reader to his or her own journey of the heart, promising, &#34;It is possible to recover the lost life of our heart and with it the intimacy, beauty, and adventure of life with God.&#34;</p><p>In <i>The Sacred Romance</i>, authors Brent Curtis and John Eldredge inspire readers to enter into the greatest romance of all time--one with God. Many Christians have tried to satiate the hunger of their hearts by substituting the love of God with things from this world. Since "our heart is the key to the Christian life," this often leads to spiritual stagnation and unhappiness, while God, the "Great Lover," attempts to lavishly adorn us with His perfect love. Doubting God's goodness coupled with fear of trusting Him blind the believer and prevent him from being wooed by God into a rich relationship. Life can soon become empty, cold, and worthless. Through personal narrative, Curtis and Eldredge take turns convincing the reader not only that God is good, but that recklessly abandoning oneself to Him results in a fulfilling life of abundance and awe. In this portrayal of God's character, the obvious error lies in believing that He could need anything from His creatures, or that He could be "hurt" by their unrequited love. On the whole, however, this is a call to a more passionate relationship with the lover of our souls. A follow-up book, <i>The Journey of Desire</i>, was written by John Eldredge after Brent Curtis's tragic death. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>John Eldredge is the director of Ransomed Heart in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a fellowship devoted to helping people discover the heart of God.

The first book to introduce the phenomenon that is the life story and work of Vivian Maier.<b><br></b><br>A good street photographer must be possessed of many talents: an eye for detail, light, and composition; impeccable timing; a populist or humanitarian outlook; and a tireless ability to constantly shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot and never miss a moment. It is hard enough to find these<br>qualities in trained photographers with the benefit of schooling and mentors and a community of fellow artists and aficionados supporting and rewarding their efforts. It is incredibly rare to find it in someone with no formal training and no network of peers.<br><br>Yet Vivian Maier is all of these things, a professional nanny, who from the 1950s until the 1990s took over 100,000 photographs worldwide&#x2014;from France to New York City to Chicago and dozens of other countries&#x2014;and yet showed the results to no one. The photos are amazing both for the breadth of the work and for the high quality of the humorous, moving, beautiful, and raw images of all facets of city life in America&#x2019;s post-war golden age.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until local historian John Maloof purchased a box of Maier&#x2019;s negatives from a Chicago auction house and began collecting and championing her marvelous work just a few years ago that any of it saw the light of day.

Seemingly without a family of her own, the children she cared for eventually acted as caregivers for Maier herself in the autumn of her life.

She was at one time the most powerful woman in the British Empire: a nation builder, the driving force behind the creation of modern-day Iraq.

Like any tourists, the delegation make the routine tour of the pyramids and have themselves photographed on camels in front of the Sphinx. Standing beneath its half-effaced head, two of the most famous Englishmen of the twentieth century confront the camera in some disarray: Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill, who has just, to the amusement of all, fallen off his camel, and T. E. Lawrence, tightly constrained in the pin-striped suit and trilby of a senior civil servant. Between them, at her ease, rides Gertrude Bell, the sole delegate possessing knowledge indispensable to the Conference. Her face, in so far as it can be seen beneath the brim of her rose-decorated straw hat, is transfigured with happiness. Her dream of an independent Arab nation is about to come true, her choice of a king endorsed: her Iraq is about to become a country. Just before leaving the Semiramis Hotel that morning, Churchill has cabled to London the vital message "Sharif's son Faisal offers hope of best and cheapest solution."&nbsp;By what evolution did a female descendant of Cumbrian sheep farmers become, in her time, the most influential figure in the Middle East? She was as English as English can be, which is to say that she was bred in the wuthering heights of Yorkshire. These northern farmers have acquired a very particular character ever since the eleventh century, when, alone among the English, they refused to submit to William the Conqueror. Physically and mentally tough, they are given to few words, unvarnished and bluntly delivered.&nbsp;Gertrude Bell's great-great-grandfather was a Carlisle blacksmith, and her great-grandfather began the first alkali factory and iron foundry at Jarrow. Her famous and powerful grandfather Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, born in 1816, was a metallurgical chemist and perhaps the country's foremost industrialist. Manufacturing steel on a huge scale, he produced one-third of the metal used in Britain and much of that used for railtrack and bridge construction in the rapidly developing Empire. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society, Britain's most distinguished scientific institution. Educated first as an engineer, he studied at Edinburgh University and at the Sorbonne in Paris, then in Denmark and the south of France. Author of The Chemical Phenomena of Iron Smelting, he was looked upon as the "high priest of British Metallurgy" and he was the first to identify the value of phosphorus fertiliser as a by-product of steel-making. Referred to as "Sir Isaac" or more familiarly as "Lowthian," in 1854 &nbsp;he was elected Lord Mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne, then later be-&nbsp;came Liberal Member of Parliament for Hartlepool and High Sheriff &nbsp;of County Durham. He was a contemporary and friend of Charles &nbsp;Darwin, Thomas Huxley, William Morris, and John Ruskin, men to whom can be attributed seminal advances in evolution and science, art, architecture, and social reform. Lowthian was president or vice-president of eight national engineering and chemical institutions, several of &nbsp;which he had founded. He was also the director of the North Eastern Railway.&nbsp;With Lowthian's two brothers John and Tom, Bell Brothers owned collieries, quarries, and iron ore mines; factories and foundries whose furnaces, burning twenty-four hours a day, regularly reddened the night skies. His company and its associates employed more than forty-seven thousand men, and the family boast was that they would make anything "from a needle to a ship." Besides the first iron and steel works in Newcastle, and the second at Port Clarence in Middlesbrough, he set up a chemical plant for the country's first manufacture of aluminium--until then, a metal as valuable as gold. On the factory's opening day, he was driven in his carriage through the streets of Newcastle in an aluminium top hat, which he doffed to the crowd. He was the first British ironmaster to own a machine for making steel rope.&nbsp;Lowthian wrote several scientific books, but his most remarkable was a comprehensive and logical assessment of Britain's prospects for competing with the world in steel production. He invested heavily in research into the process of steel-making, and was determined to push Britain into developing new technological industries. In the hope that all of British industry would follow his example, he advocated government support for scientific research and technical development. But in this, &nbsp;after a lifetime's work, he failed. As he had forecast, other countries--and particularly Germany with its Krupps armaments and Thyssen steel--grew in technical competence and productivity, outstripping Britain and building the wealth and power they were to wield in the &nbsp;First World War.&nbsp;A formidable giant of a man, a paterfamilias who would have almost sixty grandchildren--the number is disputed--Lowthian and his wife, Margaret Pattinson, set a pattern for the Bells of comfortable rather than lavish lifestyle. Considering the huge scale of his enterprises, and his position as the Bill Gates of his day, he did not live extravagantly. This may have had something to do with Margaret's influence: she came from a family of shopkeepers and scientists. His first house, Washington New Hall--four miles south of Newcastle upon Tyne, a stone's throw from the home of the ancestors of George Washington--was not quite a mansion, and the house he built at the zenith of his power, Rounton Grange, was not quite a stately home. He toyed with Gothic, but settled for William Morris's humbler Arts and Crafts style, with its emphasis on traditional artisan skills as a panacea for the ravages wreaked by the Industrial Revolution. This would remain the characteristic style of the Bells' private houses and public buildings. Unlike many heirs to great fortunes, Lowthian's elder son Hugh, Gertrude's father, also lived modestly for a captain of industry. His own first house, Red Barns, at the fishing village of Redcar on the Yorkshire coast, a short train journey from Clarence, reflected this. After Lowthian's death, the house he owned in London was sold, the money presumably divided between Hugh and his siblings--Charles, Ada, Maisie, and Florence.&nbsp;Lowthian was admired rather than loved, and appears to have been dictatorial and harsh towards his family. Gertrude and her sisters and brothers addressed him as "Pater." An illustrated family alphabet they drew up for Christmas at Rounton in 1877, when Gertrude was nine, reflects the feelings of the children towards their abrasive grandfather.&nbsp;A for us All come to spend Christmas week&nbsp;B for our Breathless endeavours to speak&nbsp;C is the Crushing Contemptuous Pater . . .&nbsp;Elsa, Gertrude's younger half-sister, has added: "Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell" in pencil, lest it be thought that this description referred to the gentler and kindlier Hugh.&nbsp;A family story suggests the awe with which "Pater" was regarded by the Bells. Lowthian forbade anyone to use his horses. When one of his granddaughters fainted one evening at dinner from a riding injury (a broken collarbone), everyone conspired to hide the truth: she had borrowed one of his horses and gone hunting with the gentry. The children's grandmother Margaret could be as scathing as Lowthian. A teatime visitor once said to her hostess: "Your scones are lovely." "So I see," retorted the old lady. "Your hand has not been out of the dish since you arrived."&nbsp;Some previously unknown stories about Lowthian emerged recently from papers found in one of the Bell houses, Mount Grace Priory, the ruined medieval abbey where Gertrude's father and stepmother ended their days. English Heritage was renovating the house before opening it to the public when they found the papers hidden under the floorboards. Among them is a reference to a tragic event at Washington New Hall, where "in 1872 a seven-year-old sweep was suffocated in the Hall chimney." If the little boy met his end in Lowthian's chimney in 1872, the ironmaster had comprehensively broken the law. Parliament had forbidden the use of children as chimney-sweeps a full twenty-six years earlier. Sir Isaac may have known nothing about the presence of the chimney-sweep until it was too late; however, whether because he was deeply upset or because he wanted to escape a damaging association, he moved into the newly built Rounton Grange as soon as possible, and let Washington New Hall stand empty and unsold. Nineteen years later, he gave it away as a home for waifs and strays, on condition it was renamed "Dame Margaret's Hall"; today, it is divided into pleasant apartments. Not perhaps unconnected with this story is the fact that many years later Hugh Bell successfully lobbied for a parliamentary bill to protect children from dangerous work. (In the 1860s, the Earl of Shaftesbury &nbsp;reported that children of four and five were still working in certain factories from six in the morning until ten at night.)&nbsp;The papers found under the boards also contained the sentence, "On one winter's night [Sir Isaac] came out of the Hall to find his coachman frozen stiff on the box-seat of his carriage." The facts remain mysterious. The unfortunate coachman may have had a heart attack rather than dying of exposure, and yet it emerges clearly that consideration for others was not, perhaps, Lowthian's principal quality.&nbsp;The author of these papers, which contain many confirmable facts about Lowthian's life and work, may have been Miss K. E. M. Cooper Abbs, a Bell relation who was the last tenant to live at Mount Grace. If she was moved to record Lowthian's life, it may be because she was incensed that, whether by accident or intent, so many family papers and archives were burnt by members of the family after his death. There is to this day no biography of the man who was as famous in his day as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.&nbsp;A more lovable, more charming man, Gertrude's father, Sir Hugh, led the Bell industries and inherited a vast fortune. Like his father, he was educated in Edinburgh, at the Sorbonne, and in Germany, where he studied mathematics and organic chemistry. He began work at eighteen at the Bell Brothers Ironworks in Newcastle, became director of the growing Port Clarence steelworks that dominated the grimy roofscape of Middlesbrough, and eventually ran the entire business and all its ramifications. He dug the ironstone from the Cleveland hills, worked the coal from Durham, brought the limestone from the backbone of England, lived on the Tees, and was a director of the North Eastern Railway, which brought the raw material to the steel foundry. His public works were second to none, especially after his second marriage to Florence Olliffe. He built schools and founded libraries, constructed meeting houses and workers' terraces, made a community centre for staff and labourers at Rounton and paid for a holiday home for worthy families needing a country break from life at the works. He also constructed the famous Transporter Bridge, which is still used to ferry workers and tourists quickly and cheaply over the River Tees. In 1906 he became Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding, welcoming royalty and other VIPs whenever they ventured into the windswept Yorkshire landscape, and was three times elected Mayor of Middlesbrough.&nbsp;In supplying the Empire, the Bells brought a global view to British industry. Sir Hugh was an accomplished public speaker, delivering persuasive messages on such subjects as free trade, which he passionately endorsed, and home rule for the Irish, which he passionately opposed. You can hear in his published speeches the vigour and humour with which he captivated audiences of all types and classes. In his words:&nbsp;Free Trade is like the quality of mercy: it is twice blessed, for it blesses him that gives and him that takes, and I for one will do nothing to place any restriction upon it. The Free market is the greatest safeguard we have against the tyranny of wealth. I look forward with dread to the accumulation of great fortunes in single hands . . . There are millions of persons in this country depending upon weekly wages, upon work which may be discontinued at the end of any week. It is with them I am concerned, and about them that I am perturbed, and not about the class to which I belong.&nbsp;He welcomed the rise of the new trade unions, while warning that the writings of Karl Marx could lead socialists into revolutionary movements that would destroy British industry and employment in the competitive world that he endorsed.&nbsp;When Gertrude was born, Queen Victoria had been on the throne for thirty years. She was driven by Prince Albert's relentless determination to replace the louche self-indulgence of Georgian Britain with Victorian industry and propriety. Britain, and particularly England, led the world in technical superiority--as evinced in that paeon to the Empire, the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in 1851. The British army, able to call on troops from around the world, represented what was probably the greatest military power of all time; the British navy held control of the oceans and the trade across them, and kept the peace. If those other empires, the Russian and the Ottoman, were still in a state of feudal serfdom and of institutionalized corruption at every level, the British example, inspired by Victoria and Albert, brought at least a concern for moderation, philanthropy, and honest dealing. By the mid-nineteenth century, the concept of Empire was evolving from one of commercial exploitation to one capable of taking a pride in honest and benevolent government. Commercially aggressive but socially responsible, the Bells personified the new mood, and they enjoyed all the confidence of the right people in the right place at the right time.&nbsp;Hugh married Mary Shield when he was twenty-three, choosing a local girl who was the daughter of a prominent merchant of Newcastle upon Tyne. They were married on the Scottish island of Bute on the Clyde, where the Shields kept a holiday home. Their first child, Gertrude, was born in 1868 at Washington New Hall, the home of Hugh's father. Family life centred on this larger-than-life industrialist who had made the Bells the sixth-richest family in England. He could not have been easy to live with, nor the house peaceful, and there are many intimations of his bombastic temperament and caustic wit. Although Hugh, his elder son, had an inclination for the political life, he had had it made brutally clear to him that his future lay in Middlesbrough, with the fastest-growing part of the iron business. Lowthian, based at the original works in Newcastle, would descend on the new Port Clarence steelworks at irregular intervals, to scrutinize and doubtless criticize every aspect of Hugh's work.&nbsp;It would have been with great relief that Hugh and Mary moved with their two-year-old daughter out of Washington New Hall for a quieter domestic life of their own. It was not to last long. Beautiful but delicate, Mary survived only three weeks after the birth of their second child, Maurice, in 1871.&nbsp;Hugh became for a time a poignant figure.

Howard</strong><br> <p><b>Question:</b> You&#x2019;ve been working on <i>Johannes Cabal</i> in its various iterations for many years now, how did it feel spending so much time with such nefarious characters? </p> <p><b>Jonathan L. Howard:</b> It&#x2019;s something of a clich� to say that villains are more interesting than heroes, nor is it even very true, so I shan&#x2019;t be trotting that particular phrase out. I would suggest that it is the inner life of the character that makes them interesting, and that is true of the virtuous as much as the vile. Cabal does some rather horrible things, it is true, but he never does them purely to give himself the opportunity to curl his waxed moustache&#x2014;he&#x2019;s clean-shaven, for one thing&#x2014;and declaim his wickedness. He always has a reason, and it&#x2019;s usually a good one. I find fictional villains who are evil because they are evil unengaging. Cabal, on the other hand, has motivations and drives that most can sympathise with, even if the actions he commits based on those drives can be loathsome. For him, the ends always justify the means, and damn the consequences. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> The carnival in your book is used as a device for collecting souls; was there a real life inspiration for the carnival? Do you find there to be something generally sinister about carnivals?</p> <p><b>Jonathan L. Howard:</b> There&#x2019;s no real life inspiration for the carnival, really, but plenty in fiction. The obvious inspiration was Bradbury&#x2019;s Something Wicked This Way Comes, which is a deserved classic. I liked the Disney film version, too, and dearly wish that its original incarnation as a screenplay in the fifties produced by Gene Kelly&#x2014;Gene Kelly!&#x2014;had come to fruition. <i>Something Wicked</i>&#x2019;s Cooger &amp; Dark&#x2019;s Carnival wasn&#x2019;t the first threatening carnival in fiction, and it certainly wasn&#x2019;t the last, but it is probably the best. It was the persnickety question of where such a carnival might come from and how anybody would end up as a proprietor that inspired my novel. </p> <p>As for how sinister they are, that is to an extent a fictional conceit on my part too. You have to bear in mind that carnivals like that are unknown in the United Kingdom, and I haven&#x2019;t heard of the traditional British travelling fair being transported by train either. The Cabal stories take place in a slightly blurry world where things come together because they aesthetically appeal to me, and not because they&#x2019;re historically accurate; a magical realism of sorts. I wanted an American-style carnival travelling by train, and that&#x2019;s what I got. That said, there are plenty of permanent fairgrounds around the country, and they tended to have a slightly creepy air about them. The real Ghost Trains in Blackpool and Porthcawl, for example, inspired the exterior of the Ghost Train in the novel. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> In addition to writing you work as a video game designer, how does that work compare to the experience of writing fiction? Are there any surprising similarities? </p> <p><b>Jonathan L. Howard:</b> There are definite similarities, but I wouldn&#x2019;t say that they are surprising. The games I&#x2019;ve worked on tend to have definite narratives, so it&#x2019;s exactly the same process of inspiration, development, pacing, and polishing. The main difference is that a novel can have significant sequences in which physically little happens, which is considered heretical in games. In fairness, there&#x2019;s good reason for that&#x2014;the player wants to be involved, and there isn&#x2019;t a great deal of opportunity for that in a scene consisting of two people talking over a cup of tea. That&#x2019;s not to say it hasn&#x2019;t been attempted, and pretty successfully. I remember a game a few years ago based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe. It hit all its target, being very atmospheric, true to its source, even thought provoking, and all without Pit and the Pendulum platformer or Fall of the House of Usher first person shooter sections. In commercial terms, however, it was never going to be the next Tomb Raider. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> Have you always been a fan or horror and supernatural lore? When did this sort of thing first capture your imagination? </p> <p><b>Jonathan L. Howard:</b> Yes, I&#x2019;ve always enjoyed the grotesque and the macabre, right from an early age. I recall that I somehow saw Dana Andrews being chased around the woods by a fireball in Night of the Demon when I was about four or five, and being fascinated. I grew up on a diet of black and white Doctor Who, The Avengers, snatched glimpses of the first few minutes of <i>Out of the Unknown</i> episodes before being sent to bed, and any number of slightly disturbing imports like <i>The Tinderbox</i> and The Singing, Ringing Tree. I remember that I got a book for Christmas sometime in the very early seventies called Stranger Than People, which was basically a young person&#x2019;s guide to Fortean phenomena, interspersed with stories like "The Yellow Monster of Sundra Strait," and Poe&#x2019;s "Metzengerstein." I loved that book; I read it so many times that the cover fell off. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> What sort of research did you do for the book? Was there anything you came across in the process that really surprised you?</p> <p><b>Jonathan L. Howard:</b> I actually did very little research for it; it was mostly lurking in my mind already. I can remember little necessary for day to day living, but if you ask me the birth name of Dr. Crippen&#x2019;s wife, I can tell you off the top of my head. I needed a bit of nomenclature for something or other in the running of a carnival, which a librarian friend found for me, but that was the only real piece of research for it. Even things like the Grand Conjuration to summon a demon&#x2014;which is an authentic ritual, you may be horrified to hear&#x2014;was in a book I already had. I have a large collection of books on assorted esoterica to the extent that my wife, a bibliophile herself, rolls her eyes and says, &#x201c;Not more bloody books?&#x201d; whenever I come home with a bookshop bag and a sheepish expression. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> There is a lot of paperwork in your version of Hell. Did you hold an especially bureaucratic job somewhere before working as a game designer?</p> <p><b>Jonathan L. Howard:</b> No, I&#x2019;m very happy to say. I remember as a child considering the inevitability of growing up and wondering what the worst thing about it would be. It all looked pretty good from that perspective: money, going to bed when you liked, being able to go into any certificate film, and so on. Finally, I spotted a bad point, and that bad point was having to fill in forms. And I was right. There&#x2019;s just something about completing a form that fills me with dread in its consideration, and depression during its commission. Which reminds me; I have two to fill in this week. Oh, joy. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> Johannes is a bit of an anti-hero and his motivations are somewhat mysterious. Do you think that he&#x2019;s misunderstood by those around him? </p> <p><b>Jonathan L. Howard:</b> He&#x2019;s definitely misunderstood, although if he were understood, it still wouldn&#x2019;t make him popular. The fact that he&#x2019;s labeled a necromancer gives him a public relations problem, as the vast majority of them are power hungry lunatics. Cabal&#x2019;s ultimate aim is to defeat death, and to have the ability to bring people back just as they were when they were alive, physically, mentally, and spiritually. No lurking demonic possessions, no uncouth brain gobbling. His researches in that direction, however, have not been conducted in the most advantageous light. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> What&#x2019;s next for you? </p> <p><b>Jonathan L. Howard:</b> I handed in the submission draft of the second Cabal novel <i>Johannes Cabal the Detective</i> just the other week, so that will be going through the editorial process shortly. I also have to decide what the next Cabal novel after that will be; I have a couple of ideas so it&#x2019;s a case of weighing pros and cons before making a decision. I have a couple of non-Cabal novels, one of which is completed but needs a second draft, and the other is about 80% done. I&#x2019;d like to get them polished, and then see if we can get them into print. </p> (Photo � Emma L.B.K. Smith)Jonathan L.

The humility of this title--the "now and then" that refers to the occasional glimpse of glory but does not claim any more for itself than that--beautifully reveals something of the tone and attitude of Buechner himself. It also suggests what it is about him that readers hold so dear. In this volume, picking up where the first book left off, Buechner begins with his education at Union Theological Seminary, where he studied under Tillich and others. He then tells of his years as minister and teacher at Phillips Exeter Academy, concluding with his move to Vermont and his decision to make a living as a full-time writer.<p> As he says very simply in the introduction, "if you tell your own story with sufficient candor and concreteness, it will be an interesting story and in some sense a universal story." It will also, as this book affirms, be a story that says something of the myriad ways in which God speaks to us. This realization lies at the center of this small but lovely book. "Autobiography becomes a way of praying," he concludes, "and a book like this, if it matters at all, matters mostly as a call to prayer." <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p><p>Frederick Buechner, author of more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction, is an ordained Presbyterian minister. He has been a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and was honored by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Based to some extent on the writings of Plato and other earlier authors, <i>Utopia</i> nevertheless contained much that was original with More.<br>In the nearly 500 years since the book's publication, there have been many attempts at establishing "Utopias" both in theory and in practice. All of them, however, seem to embody ideas already present in More's classic treatise: optimistic faith in human nature, emphasis on the environment and proper education, nostalgia for a lost innocence, and other positive elements.<br>In this new, inexpensive edition, readers can study for themselves the essentials of More's utopian vision and how, although the ideal society he envisioned is still unrealized, at least some of his proposals have come to pass in today's world.</p><p></p></p><p><i>The Life of Thomas More</i> is Peter Ackroyd's biography--from baptism to beheading--of the lawyer who became a saint. More, a noted humanist whose friendship with Erasmus and authorship of <i>Utopia</i> earned him great fame in Europe, succeeded Cardinal Wolsey as Lord Chancellor of London at the time of the English Reformation. In 1535, More was martyred for his refusal to support Henry VIII's divorce and break with Rome. Ackroyd's biography is a masterpiece in several senses. Perhaps most importantly, he corrects the mistaken impression that Robert Bolt's <i>A Man for All Seasons</i> has given two generations of theater and film audiences: More was not, as Bolt's drama would have us believe, a civil disobedient who put his conscience above the law. Ackroyd explains that "conscience was not for More an individual matter." Instead, it was derived from "the laws of God and of reason." If the greatest justice in this book is analytic, however, its greatest joys are descriptive. Ackroyd brings 16th-century London to life for his readers--an exotic world where all of life is enveloped by the church: "As the young More made his way along the lanes and thoroughfares, there was the continual sound of bells." --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>Thomas More&#39;s Utopia is one of the supreme achievements of Renaissance humanism. His complex and ironic account of an imaginary communist society has not only given rise to the genre of utopian fiction but has been an inspiration to generations of political reformers.</p><h2>Theology of Hope: On the Ground and the Implications of a Christian Eschatology</h2><p>&#34;The following efforts bear the title Theology of Hope, not because they set out once again to present eschatology as a separate doctrine and to compete with the well known textbooks. Rather, their aim is to show how theology can set out from hope and begin to consider its theme in an eschatological light. For this reason they inquire into the ground of the hope of Christian faith and into the responsible exercise of this hope in thought and action in the world today. The various critical discussions should not be understood as rejections and condemnations. They are necessary conversations on a common subject which is so rich that it demands continual new approaches.&#34;</p><p>&#39;With clear decisive strokes, Moltmann shows that for both Jews and Christians history is rooted in actual events and sets its sights on a real future in accordance with God&#39;s promises....

In this autobiography, Churchill recalls his childhood, his schooling, his years as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Boer War, and his first forays into politics as a member of Parliament. <i>My Early Life</i> not only gives readers insights into the shaping of a great leader but, as Churchill himself wrote, &#x201c;a picture of a vanished age.&#x201d; To fully understand Winston Churchill and his times, <i>My Early Life</i> is essential reading.</p><p>The voice of a vanished England speaks from the pages of Winston Churchill's evocative memoir of his first 30 years (1874-1904). The young Churchill inhabits a world in which men fight like hell in meaningless colonial wars--India, Egypt, South Africa--soldiering across the imperial map then extending the hand of friendship to their erstwhile enemy as if they were schoolmates at Harrow. Yet Churchill, born into a privileged family, was not an uncritical supporter of the Victorian status quo. He himself loathed Harrow; an especially amusing chapter skewers the school's emphasis on an irrelevant classical education and rote learning. A firm Tory, he considered himself a friend of the working class, and in 1899 campaigned for parliament with a Socialist colleague. Looking back from his vantage point of 1930, Churchill expresses the most attractive values of the English aristocracy--honor, loyalty, fair play--without giving the impression he wants to live in the past. The book's appeal also stems from its magisterial but colloquial prose. Anyone familiar with recordings of Churchill's rousing speeches during Word War II will hear in their minds' ears that growling timbre and unmistakably patrician accent as they read. Though he would have preferred the peace prize, <i>My Early Life</i> offers good evidence that Churchill's 1953 Nobel for literature was aptly awarded. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Winston Churchill (1874&#x2013;1965) was prime minister of Great Britain from 1940&#x2013;1945 and 1951&#x2013;1955. A prolific writer, whose works include <i>The Second World War</i> and <i>A History of the English Speaking Peoples</i>, Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953.</p><h2>Temple Cat</h2><p>"This endearing tale is sure to find favor wherever cat stories are in demand.

Worshipped as a god with servants to coddle him, a temple cat in ancient Egypt yearns for the freedom to live as a normal feline.

This new edition contains some practical notes by Wally Leeds, a mason in Tunbridge,Vermont who builds Rumford fireplaces today.</p><p>Vrest Orton loved the five fireplaces in his 1828 Federal brick house in Weston, Vermont because of their architectural beauty and because of the enormous amount of heat they produced without letting smoke into the rooms. In his quest to understand why his old fireplaces worked so much better than most "modern" versions, Orton discovered the work of Count Rumford, the eighteenth-century genius who brought fireplace design to an unprecedented level of efficiency. <p>Born Benjamin Thompson in Woburn, Massachusetts in 1753, Rumford was a Tory during the American Revolution, and he emigrated to Britain. While in Britain, he applied himself to the study and improvement of smoky fireplaces, and had so much success that his fame spread to Europe. In Bavaria, his contributions to society were so appreciated that he was ennobled as "Count of the Holy Roman Empire" by the Elector of Bavaria. He took the name "Rumford" from the old name for Concord, New Hampshire. </p><p>In this book, Vrest Orton recounts the fascinating story of Count Rumford. He then goes on to spell out Rumford's basic principals of fireplace design with the help of drawings by Austin Stevens. Since its original publication in 1969, this book has gone through numerous printings and has brought about a revival of the Rumford fireplace. </p><p>Vrest Orton served in France during World War I, had a distinguished career in book and magazine publishing for twenty years, and then moved back to Vermont after Pentagon service following World War II to found the Vermont Country Store, which issues one of America's most trusted and popular mail-order catalogs. </p><p>This new edition included some notes and clarification by Wally Leeds, a mason in Tunbridge, Vermont who had built many Rumford fireplaces.

This natural capacity of awake awareness is already&nbsp;available&nbsp;within us and Loch shows us how to shift into living from this effortless&nbsp;awareness&nbsp;immediately using his &nbsp;short glimpse&nbsp;practices.<br>Loch presents us with the possibility that awakening can be the natural next stage of human development. Awakening is not a rare event limited to those who leave for the monastery or cave. We can awaken in the midst of our daily lives by discovering what Loch Kelly calls "open-hearted awareness."&nbsp;<br>For the past two decades, this innovative psychotherapist and meditation teacher has been helping people from every background learn how to access a spacious, natural way of living in tune with a deeper truth. <i>Shift into Freedom</i> presents Loch Kelly's original synthesis of ancient wisdom, modern psychological insights, current neuroscience research, and unique awareness practices for the body, mind, and heart.&nbsp;<br>Written for both first-time and lifelong meditators, here is a training guide filled with simple and effective experiential tools for "unhooking" awareness from our chattering minds and dropping into our awake heart space, expanding our sense of intimacy and interconnection, and embodying inner peace, clarity, and love.</p><p><b>Loch Kelly, M.Div., LCSW</b> is an author, educator, consultant, and recognized leader in the field of meditation and psychotherapy who studied with Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche and Mingyur Rinpoche. &nbsp;Loch was asked to teach direct realization by Adyashanti.

Shift Into Freedom a shining gem in the modern spiritual landscape. This book is wise and loving medicine for anyone who is ready to take responsibility for their own liberation here and now." ~ From the Foreword by <b>Adyashanti</b><br><br>"Kelly's guide to finer spiritual living maintains a non-psychological, non-denominational, and contemporary focus, drawing on wisdom from a diverse selection of traditional teachings, including Mahamudra practice, Taoist teaching, the works of William James, and modern neuroscience. Kelly articulates his structured, unified worldview with coherent language. He stresses a move away from ego-identification in our everyday lives and believes that access to awakening experiences is universally available: 'awake awareness' is not reserved for full time spiritual seekers, but is in fact the next developmental step for humankind's new normal. Practices that Kelly calls 'glimpses' take readers through the basics of mindful meditation and then through techniques some other teachers reserve for advanced study, including the process of unhooking local awareness from thought, waking up to transcendence, waking in to embodiment, and waking out to interconnectedness. Those who feel that other mindfulness texts are esoteric, foreign, or flaky will find Kelly's exercises easy to understand, his research easy to respect, and his methods blissfully lacking in both the aggressiveness common in the self-improvement genre and the focus on the author's personal experience common in new age takes."<br> --<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>"<i>Shift into Freedom</i> is a gift to us all.

Why do men kill, rape, and wage war, and what can we do about it? <i>Demonic Males</i> offers startling new answers to these questions. Drawing on the latest discoveries about human evolution and about our closest living relatives, the great apes, the book unfolds a compelling argument that the secrets of a peaceful society may well be, first, a sharing of power between males and females, and second, a high level and variety of sexual activity, both homosexual and heterosexual. Dramatic, vivid, and sometimes shocking, but firmly grounded in meticulous scientific research, <i>Demonic Males</i> will stir controversy and debate. It will be required reading for anyone concerned about the spiral of violence undermining human society.</p><p>If you harbor a sneaking suspicion that men are a herd of ignoble savages, then this book is for you. Authors Wrangham and Peterson will confirm your instincts. It turns out that hyperviolent social behavior is deeply rooted in male human genes and common among our closest male primate relatives. Rapes, beatings and killings are as much a part of life among the great apes as they are among us. The authors try to conclude on some upbeat notes that ring hollow, but their science reveals much about the dark side of human nature.Dale Peterson is the coauthor with Jane Goodall of <i>Visions of Caliban</i> (a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book and a <i>Library Journal</i> Best Book) and the editor of her two books of letters, <i>Africa in My Blood</i> and <i>Beyond Innocence</i>.

This sultry and suspenseful follow-up focuses on the exploits of GhostWalker Nicolas Trevane, who sets out to rescue Dahlia Le Blanc, a government operative with astonishing telekinetic talents, from her secluded residence in the Louisiana bayou. Nicolas's mission is fraught with danger. Not only is Dahlia emotionally unstable (she can make objects go up in flames when she's particularly upset), she's also been targeted by a traitor who has hired mercenaries to kill her. As Nicolas and Dahlia evade their pursuers and attempt to unmask the traitor, they forge a strong emotional bond. Dahlia fears her psychic powers may rage out of control if she makes love to Nicolas, but their passion culminates in a love scene that, while hot, only involves a handful of harmless flames. Feehan's newest offering is as swift-moving and sexually charged as her best vampire romances (<i>Dark Destiny</i>, etc.), with none of their florid prose. In short, it is an electrifying read, one that should satisfy her fans and cement her reputation as the reigning queen of the paranormal romance. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But first he must complete one last assignment (and one that he is not too happy about): acting as a glorified bodyguard to hotel heiress Regan Hamilton Madison. The gorgeous exec has become entangled in some potentially deadly business. Someone has e-mailed her a graphic crime-scene photo&#x2013;and the victim is no stranger.<br><br>Regan suspects that the trouble started when she agreed to help a journalist friend expose a shady self-help guru who preys on lonely, vulnerable women. In fact, the smooth-as-an-oil-slick Dr. Lawrence Shields may be responsible for the death of one of his devotees, which was ruled a suicide. Hoping to find some damning evidence, Regan attends a Shields seminar.<br><br>At the gathering, the doctor persuades his guests to partake in an innocent little &#x201c;cleansing&#x201d; exercise. He asks them to make a list of the people who have hurt or deceived them over the years, posing the question: <i>Would your world be a better place if these people ceased to exist?</i> Treating the exercise as a game, Regan plays along. After ten minutes, Shields instructs the participants to bring their sheets of paper to the fireplace and throw them into the flames. But Regan misses this part of the program when she exits the room to take a call&#x2013;and barely escapes a menacing individual in the parking lot.<br><br>The experience is all but forgotten&#x2013;until the first person on Regan&#x2019;s list turns up dead. Shock turns to horror when other bodies from the list start to surface, as a harrowing tango of desire and death is set into motion. Now brutal murders seem to stalk her every move&#x2013;and a growing attraction to Alec may compromise her safety, while stirring up tender emotions she thought she could no longer feel. Yet as the danger intensifies and a serial killer circles ever closer, Regan must discover who has turned her private revenge fantasies into grisly reality.</p><p><b>JULIE GARWOOD</b> is the author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Killjoy</i>, <i>Mercy</i>, <i>Heartbreaker</i>, <i>Ransom</i>, and <i>Come the Spring</i>.

The beast always began to stir at the end of the day when his mind wasn&#x2019;t consumed with his job, and his body so desperately needed to relax.<br><br>For a long time, nearly a full year, the demon had hidden from him, and he hadn&#x2019;t known it was there. And so he&#x2019;d naively believed that he was having panic attacks, or spells, as he liked to think of them, because that somehow made them less threatening. They started with a yearning deep in his belly. It wasn&#x2019;t altogether unpleasant. He likened the sensation to wrapping his arms around a hot stone to warm his freezing body, but as the day progressed, the stone began to get hotter and hotter, until it radiated unbearable heat. Anxiety would come over him then, horrific anxiety that would make his skin crawl and his lungs burn with the need to scream and scream and scream, and in desperation he would think about taking one of his special pills the doctor had prescribed, but he never did take anything, not even an aspirin, for fear the medication would weaken him.<br><br>He believed he was a good man. He paid his taxes, went to church on Sundays, and held down a full-time job. It was a stressful, had-to-stay-on-his-toes kind of job, requiring his full concentration, and there wasn&#x2019;t time to think or worry about the heavy burden waiting for him at home. He didn&#x2019;t mind the long hours. In fact, there were times he was grateful for them. He never ran from his responsibilities in his professional or his personal life. He took care of his invalid wife, Nina. At her insistence they had moved to Chicago for a new start after the accident. He&#x2019;d found employment within two weeks of his arrival and had felt that was a good omen. It was a hectic but joyful time. He and Nina decided to use a small portion of the settlement money to purchase a spacious story-and-a-half house on the outskirts of the city, and once they were unpacked, he spent the summer evenings putting in ramps and modifying the first floor so that Nina wouldn&#x2019;t have any trouble getting around in her new state-of-the-art, featherweight wheelchair. Nina&#x2019;s legs had been mangled in the accident, and she would, of course, never walk again. He accepted what fate had dealt them and moved forward. He was relieved when his wife slowly regained her strength and learned to do for herself during the day.<br><br>When he was home, he insisted on pampering her. He prepared their dinner every night and did the dishes, then spent the rest of the evening with her watching their favorite television shows.<br><br>They&#x2019;d been married ten years, and in all that time their love hadn&#x2019;t diminished. If anything, the terrible accident had removed any possibility of their falling into complacency or taking each other for granted. And no wonder. His sweet, gentle Nina had died on that operating table, and then, miracle of miracles, had come back to him. The surgeons had worked through the night to save her. When he heard the news that she would recover, he got down on his knees in the hospital chapel and vowed to spend the rest of his life making her happy.<br><br>He lived a rich, full life . . . with one little exception.<br><br>Awareness of the demon hadn&#x2019;t been gradual. No, enlightenment had come all at once.<br><br>It was the middle of the night. He hadn&#x2019;t been able to sleep, and rather than toss and turn and possibly wake Nina, he went to the kitchen on the opposite end of the house and paced about. He thought a glass of warm milk might help calm his jitters and make him sleepy, but it really didn&#x2019;t do much good. He was putting the empty glass in the sink when it slipped out of his hand and shattered in the basin. The sound seemed to reverberate throughout the house. He rushed to the bedroom door and stood outside, waiting and listening. The noise hadn&#x2019;t awakened his wife, and he felt a moment of relief as he padded back to the kitchen.<br><br>His anxiety was building. Was he losing his mind? No, no. He was having one of his spells. That was all. And this one wasn&#x2019;t so terrible. He could handle it.<br><br>The newspaper was on the counter where he&#x2019;d left it. He picked it up and carried it to the table. He decided he would read every single page, or until he was so sleepy he couldn&#x2019;t keep his eyes open.<br><br>He started with the sports section, read every word, and then moved on to the metropolitan news. He scanned an article about the dedication of a new park and jogging path, spread the paper wide and immediately saw the photo of a beautiful young woman standing in front of a group of men. She was posed with scissors ready to cut a ribbon draped from one stake to another across the path. And she was smiling at him.<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t take his eyes off her.<br><br>He was reading the names under the photo when it happened. He suddenly felt a crushing tightness, and he couldn&#x2019;t catch his breath. A jolt very much like lightning raced through his heart causing excruciating pain. Was he having a heart attack, or was it another panic attack?<br><br>Try to calm down, he told himself. Just calm down. Take deep breaths.<br><br>The anxiety was growing even stronger, and with it came the horrific yet familiar terror. Then his skin began to burn and itch, and he frantically scratched his arms and legs as he jumped up and paced around the kitchen island. What was happening to him?<br><br>He realized he was running and forced himself to stop. Looking down, he saw the long, jagged scratches. There were bloody streaks on his arms and legs, some cuts so deep, blood dripped on the floor. He was close to exploding. He tore at his hair and whimpered, but the terror was taunting him now. Then, like a blinding light, the epiphany came. He suddenly realized he no longer had control over his own body. He couldn&#x2019;t even make himself breathe.<br><br>With startling clarity he saw and understood. Someone else was breathing for him.<br><br>He awakened the following morning curled up in the fetal position on the kitchen floor. Had he fainted? He thought maybe he had. He staggered to his feet and braced his hands on the island to steady himself. Closing his eyes, he took several deep breaths and slowly straightened. He spotted the scissors on top of the folded newspaper. Had he placed them there? He couldn&#x2019;t remember. He put the scissors back in the drawer where they belonged and picked up the newspaper to throw it into the recycle bin in the garage. He saw the clipping from the newspaper then. Both the article and the photo of the smiling woman were there in the center of his table, waiting for him. He knew who had placed them there. And he knew why.<br><br>The demon wanted her.<br><br>He buried his face in his hands and wept.<br><br>He knew that he must find another way to placate the beast. Physical activity seemed to help. He went to the gym and began to work out like a man obsessed. One of his favorite routines was to put on boxing gloves and pound the bag as hard as he could for as long as he could. He would lose track of time and stop only when he couldn&#x2019;t raise his arms without suffering unbearable pain.<br><br>For days he&#x2019;d kept his body in the state of perpetual exhaustion. Then, even that wasn&#x2019;t enough.<br><br>Time was running out. The demon was consuming him. Ironically, it was his wife who gave him the idea. One evening, while she kept him company as he did the dishes, she suggested that he should have a night out. A night, she insisted, when he could enjoy himself and have some fun with his friends.<br><br>He put up quite an argument. There were already too many nights when he had to be away from her because of pressing commitments at work. And what about all the time he left to go running or to work out at the gym? Surely that was enough alone time.<br><br>She was more stubborn than he was and wouldn&#x2019;t stop cajoling. He finally agreed, only to make her happy.<br><br>And so, tonight would be his first night out. He could already feel the adrenaline pumping. He was as nervous and excited as he had been when he had gone on his first date.<br><br>Before leaving home, he told Nina he would be heading into the city after work to meet some friends at Sully&#x2019;s, a popular bar and grill, but she wasn&#x2019;t to worry; if he had more than one drink, he wouldn&#x2019;t drive home. He&#x2019;d take a cab.<br><br>All of it was a lie.<br><br>No, he wasn&#x2019;t going to the city to relax. He was going there to hunt.<br><br> Chapter Two REGAN MADISON HAD SPENT THREE MISERABLE DAYS AND NIGHTS surrounded by sleazebags. They seemed to be everywhere&#x2014;in the airports, at the hotel, and on the streets of Rome as well. A sleazebag, as she defined him, was a lecherous but rich old man with a mistress less than half his age hanging on his arm. Regan had never really paid any attention to such couples be- fore her stepfather, Emerson, married Cindy, his child bride. Regan understood the appeal. Cindy had the body of a strip- per. She also had the IQ of plywood. And that made her perfect for him.<br><br>Fortunately for Regan, the deliriously happy and definitely dysfunctional couple stayed on in Rome while she flew home to Chicago. Exhausted from her long flight, she went to bed early and slept a full eight hours thinking that tomorrow would be a better day.<br><br>She was wrong about that.<br><br>She awakened at six o&#x2019;clock the following morning feeling as though a thousand rubber bands were wrapped around her left knee, cutting off her circulation. She had banged it on her dresser the night before and hadn&#x2019;t taken the time to ice it. The pain was nearly unbearable. Throwing her covers back, she sat up and rubbed her knee until the throbbing subsided.<br><br>Her bad knee was the result of an injury in a charity baseball game. She had been playing first base, doing a creditable job too, until she pivoted the wrong way and tore her meniscal cartilage. The orthopedic surgeon she&#x2019;d consulted advised surgery and assured her she&#x2019;d be back in action in just a few days, but Regan kept putting the procedure off.<br><br>She swung her feet off the bed and leaned forward to stand, cautiously putting her weight on the sore knee. Then, as if she weren&#x2019;t miserable enough, she started sneezing, and her eyes began to water.<br><br>Regan had a love/hate relationship with her hometown. She loved the galleries and the museums, thought the shopping was every bit as wonderful as it was in New York&#x2014;an opinion her two best friends, Sophie and Cordelia, vehemently disagreed with&#x2014;and she believed that at least eighty percent of the inhabitants were good, decent, law-abiding citizens. Most smiled when she passed them on the street; some even said hello. Like the majority of Midwesterners, they were friendly and polite, but not intrusive. They were hardy souls, even though they loved to complain about the weather, especially in the winter months when the wind really did feel like knives slicing through your back or chest, depend- ing on whether you were walking away from Lake Michigan or toward it.<br><br>For Regan, however, spring was a real nuisance. She suffered from allergies, and each spring, while ragweed and mold flourished, she turned into a walking pharmacy. Yet, she refused to let it slow her down. On the days when the air was heavy or the pol- len count was sky high, she stuffed packets of tissues, aspirin, antihistamines, decongestants, and eyedrops into her purse and kept on going.<br><br>She had a full day scheduled and knew she should get cracking, but all she wanted to do was crawl under the soft down comforter in her soft warm bed. It was so good to be home.<br><br>Home for Regan was a suite at The Hamilton, one of the five-star hotels owned and operated by her family. It was located in the fashionable Water Tower district of Chicago and boasted a reputation for elegance, sophistication, and comfort. For the time being, she was satisfied with her living arrangements. She had everything she needed at the hotel. The corporate offices were there, and so her work was conveniently an elevator ride away. Besides, she had known most of the staff her entire life and thought of them as family.<br><br>As much as she wanted to go back to bed, she didn&#x2019;t give in to the urge. Shoving her hair out of her eyes, she staggered into the bathroom, washed her face and brushed her teeth, then put on her workout clothes, clipped her hair in a ponytail, and took the elevator up to the eighteenth floor to do two miles on the new, indoor track. She wasn&#x2019;t about to let a little bout of hay fever or any aches and pains in her knee set her back. Two miles every day, no matter what.<br><br>By seven-thirty she was back in her room and had showered, dressed, and eaten her standard breakfast of wheat toast, grapefruit, and hot tea.<br><br>Regan had just sat down at the desk in the parlor suite to go over her notes when the phone rang.<br><br>Cordelia was calling to check in. &#x201c;How was Rome?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was your stepfather there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, he was.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So how could the trip have been okay? Come on, Regan. You&#x2019;re talking to me, Cordie.&#x201d;<br><br>Regan sighed. &#x201c;It was awful,&#x201d; she admitted. &#x201c;Just awful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I take it stepdaddy had his new bride with him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, she was there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is she still hanging out of everything Escada?&#x201d;<br><br>Regan smiled. Cordie did have a way of making the most horrid situations amusing. She knew what her friend was doing&#x2014; trying to lighten the mood. It worked too. &#x201c;Not Escada,&#x201d; she corrected. &#x201c;Versace. And yes, she&#x2019;s still spilling out of everything Versace.&#x201d;<br><br>Cordie snorted. &#x201c;I can just picture it. Were your brothers there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aiden was, of course. The hotel in Rome was his pet project, and he was his usually serious self. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve seen him smile in years. Guess that goes with being the oldest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about Spencer and Walker?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Spencer had to stay in Melbourne. Some last-minute problems developed with the design for the new hotel. Walker was there, but only for the reception. He wanted to rest up before the race.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So did you speak to him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I did.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good for you. You&#x2019;ve finally forgiven him then, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess I have. He was only doing what he thought was right. Time has given me some perspective, as you predicted, so go ahead and gloat. Besides, I&#x2019;d feel terrible if he used up all of his lives before I let him know I&#x2019;d forgiven him. He wrecked another car last month,&#x201d; she added.<br><br>&#x201c;And walked away without a scratch on him, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you aren&#x2019;t mad at him anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just wish he wouldn&#x2019;t jump the gun the way he does. He&#x2019;s so impulsive. I have a couple of dates with a man, and he&#x2019;s hiring people to investigate him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me. You had more than a couple of dates with Dennis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, well . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At least you didn&#x2019;t let him break your heart. I know for a fact you didn&#x2019;t love him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How did you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When you broke up, you didn&#x2019;t shed a tear. Face it, Regan, you cry at Puppy Chow commercials. If you didn&#x2019;t cry over Dennis, your heart wasn&#x2019;t really in it. And just for the record, I&#x2019;m thrilled you dumped him. He was all wrong for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At the time I didn&#x2019;t think he was all wrong. I thought he was close to perfect. We had so much in common. He loved the theater, the ballet, and the opera, and he didn&#x2019;t mind attending all those fund-raisers. I thought we had the same values&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that wasn&#x2019;t the real Dennis, was it? He was after your money, Regan, and you&#x2019;ve got too much going for you to put up with that nonsense.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t going to give me another pep talk about how pretty and smart I am, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t have time to do the pep talk now. I&#x2019;ve got to get back to the lab before one of my students blows it up.

Oliver has since published twenty books of poetry and six books of prose. As a young woman, Oliver studied at Ohio State University and Vassar College, but took no degree. She lived for several years at the home of Edna St. Vincent Millay in upper New York state, companion to the poet&#x2019;s sister Norma Millay. It was there, in the late &#x2019;50s, that she met photographer Molly Malone Cook. For more than forty years, Cook and Oliver made their home together, largely in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where they lived until Cook&#x2019;s death in 2005. Over the course of her long and illustrious career, Oliver has received numerous awards. Her fourth book, <i>American Primitive</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1984. She has also received the Shelley Memorial Award; a Guggenheim Fellowship; an American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Achievement Award; the Christopher Award and the L.L. Winship/PEN New England Award for House of Light; the National Book Award for New and Selected Poems; a Lannan Foundation Literary Award; and the New England Booksellers Association Award for Literary Excellence. Oliver&#x2019;s essays have appeared in <i>Best American Essays</i> 1996, 1998, 2001; the Anchor Essay Annual 1998, as well as Orion, Onearth and other periodicals. Oliver was editor of <i>Best American Essays</i> 2009. Oliver&#x2019;s books on the craft of poetry, <i>A Poetry Handbook</i> and <i>Rules for the Dance</i>, are used widely in writing programs. She is an acclaimed reader and has read in practically every state as well as other countries. She has led workshops at various colleges and universities, and held residencies at Case Western Reserve University, Bucknell University, University of Cincinnati, and Sweet Briar College. From 1995, for five years, she held the Catharine Osgood Foster Chair for Distinguished Teaching at Bennington College. She has been awarded Honorary Doctorates from The Art Institute of Boston (1998), Dartmouth College (2007) and Tufts University (2008).&#x201c;A &#x2018;nature&#x2019; poet in the league of Wordsworth, whose poetry is said to have inspired this volume. . .

Both Catholics and evangelicals, he says, have moved too far away from a sacramental mindset, focusing more on the "here-and-now" than on the "then-and-there." Yet, as Boersma points out, the teaching of Jesus, Paul, and St. Augustine -- indeed, of most of Scripture and the church fathers -- is profoundly&nbsp;<i>otherworldly</i>, much more concerned with heavenly participation than with earthly enjoyment.<br><br> In&nbsp;<i>Heavenly Participation</i>&nbsp;Boersma draws on the wisdom of great Christian minds ancient and modern -- Irenaeus, Gregory of Nyssa, C. S. Lewis, Henri de Lubac, John Milbank, and many others. He urges Catholics and evangelicals alike to retrieve a sacramental worldview, to cultivate a greater awareness of eternal mysteries, to partake eagerly of the divine life that transcends and transforms all earthly realities.</p><p>Hans Boersma holds the J. I. Packer Chair in Theology atRegent College in Vancouver, B.C. His books includeNouvelle Th�ologie and Sacramental Ontology: AReturn to Mystery and Violence, Hospitality, andthe Cross: Reappropriating the Atonement Tradition,which won the 2005 Christianity Today Book Award intheology/ethics.<b>David Lyle Jeffrey</b><br> &#x2014; Baylor University<br> "Hans Boersma makes a superb contribution to evangelical theological reflection in this well-designed book, and it goes a long way to drawing us back from the brink of a fashionable evangelical tendency to reductive historicism. His re-situation of the doctrine of the Incarnation in its historic sacramental language and thought opens up the way to a deeper understanding of the truths of faith that evangelicals and Catholics alike seek to comprehend and nurture."<br><br><b>Robert Louis Wilken</b><br> &#x2014; University of Virginia<br> "Theology at its best, says Hans Boersma, is less interested in comprehending the truth than in participating in it. Skillfully marshalling passages from the church fathers and medieval theologians and drawing judiciously on contemporary evangelical and Catholic thinkers, Boersma shows that theology is not primarily an intellectual enterprise but a spiritual discipline by which one enters into the truth and is mastered by it. Though this 'sacramental tapestry,' as he calls it, is as old as the church, it is refreshing to have it presented anew in this engaging book."<br><br><b><i>American Theological Inquiry</i></b><br> "Starts a timely conversation about reform within evangelical Christianity."<br><br><b><i>Journal of Spiritual Formation and Soul Care</i></b><br> "I wholeheartedly suggest this book for seminary classrooms in spiritual formation and to every thinker who is engaging questions of spiritual formation."<br><br><b><i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i></b><br> "This is a book that is well worth reading as it provides an important background for and corrective to a missing component in contemporary theological reflection."<br><br><b><i>Reviews in Religion and Theology</i></b><br> "Boersma's book serves as a valuable contribution to the bourgeoning evangelical reflection on the church fathers and medieval theologians."<br><br><b><i>Theological Studies</i></b><br> "The reader will learn much about the development of eucharistic theology as well as the movement of&nbsp;<i>nouvelle th�ologie</i>."<br><br><b><i>Catholic Library World</i></b><br> "A brilliant and novel reconsideration of discovering spiritual realities alive in our mundane world."<br><br><b><i>First Things</i></b><br> "A promised sign of evangelical theology seeking to root itself more deeply in the tradition of the Church."</p><h2>Designing for People: An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering</h2><p>Whether it is the car you drive or the app on your smartphone, technology has an increasingly powerful influence on you.

And yet, in the summer of 1900, East London is still poor, still brutal, still a shadow city to its western twin. Among the reformers is an idealistic young woman named India Selwyn-Jones, recently graduated from medical school. With the help of her influential fianc�--Freddie Lytton, an up-and-coming Liberal MP--she works to shut down the area's opium dens that destroy both body and soul. Her selfless activities better her patients' lives and bring her immense gratification, but unfortunately, they also bring her into direct conflict with East London's ruling crime lord--Sid Malone.<br><br> India is not good for business and at first, Malone wants her out. But against all odds, India and Sid fall in love. Different in nearly every way, they share one thing in common--they're both wounded souls. Their love is impossible and they know it, yet they cling to it desperately. Lytton, India's fianc�, will stop at nothing to marry India and gain her family's fortune.<br><br> Fractious criminal underlings and rivals conspire against Sid. When Sid is finally betrayed by one of his own, he must flee London to save his life. Mistakenly thinking him dead, India, pregnant and desperate, marries Freddie to provide a father for hers and Sid's child. India and Sid must each make a terrible sacrifice--a sacrifice that will change them both forever. One that will lead them to other lives, and other places . . . and perhaps--one distant, bittersweet day--back to each other.</p><p>Every now and again, a storyteller comes along who can take us completely into her world and make us wish we never had to leave it. Jennifer Donnelly is such a writer.<p></p> <p>When India Selwyn Jones, a young woman from a noble family, graduates from the London School of Medicine for Women in 1900, her professors advise her to set up her practice in London's esteemed Harley Street. Driven and idealistic, India chooses to work in the city's East End instead, serving the desperately poor.</p> <p>In these grim streets, India meets--and saves the life of--London's most notorious gangster, Sid Malone. A hard, wounded man, Malone is the opposite of India's aristocratic fianc�, Freddie Lytton, a rising star in the House of Commons. Though Malone represents all she despises, India finds herself unwillingly drawn ever closer to him, intrigued by his hidden, mysterious past.</p> <p>Though they fight hard against their feelings, India and Sid fall in love, and their unpredictable, passionate and bittersweet affair causes destruction they could never have imagined.

Distinguished by the former Seattle policewoman's razor-sharp eye for telling detail and her penetrating analysis of the criminal mind, this gripping collection of accounts drawn from her personal files features the twisting case of Randy Roth, who married -- and murdered -- for profit. In her trademark narrative style, Ann Rule weaves a tale that is riveting, enraging, and heartbreaking all at once, and brilliantly chronicles the fateful confluence of a killer and his female victims, as well as the shattering investigation into Roth's heinous crimes.</p><p>Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print. Her first bestseller was&nbsp;<i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, about her personal relationship with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. A former Seattle police officer, she used her firsthand expertise in all her books. For more than three decades, she was a powerful advocate for victims of violent crime. She lived near Seattle and died in 2015.The centerpiece of this chilling collection is the history of Randy Roth, a "modern-day Bluebeard" who specialized in marrying women and then killing them for insurance and Social Security benefits. Rule ( Everything She Ever Wanted ) traces Roth's crimes thoroughly and does an equally complete job of providing information on the investigative side of the story, such as the difficulties of being a female prosecutor. The remaining shorter cases come from Rule's "archives": a rapist returns after eight years in prison to kill the woman who put him there along with her daughter and a neighbor; a jilted husband hires a female "hit person" to kill his estranged wife; a 13-year-old girl disappears after tending to the mobile home of a friend on vacation; a sadistic killer murders a woman, chops her up and disposes of her dismembered body in a slough; and a young, single woman is strangled by a neighbor pretending to be her protector. In a brief introduction to each, Rule discusses the effect of the individual case on her feelings about capital punishment and other issues, and her unwavering voice presents even the most gruesome details rationally.

Sharp, acrid, with a hint of sulfur. And something else. Sweet and sickening. <br><br>Like death. <br><br>He opened his eyes. <br><br>He lay prone on the floor, arms extended, palms to the hardwood, which he immediately noticed was sticky. <br><br>What happened? <br><br>He&#x2019;d attended the April gathering of the Danish Antiquarian Booksellers Society a few blocks west of his bookshop, near the gaiety of Tivoli. He liked the monthly meetings and this one had been no exception. A few drinks, some friends, and lots of book chatter. Tomorrow morning he&#x2019;d agreed to meet Cassiopeia Vitt. Her call yesterday to arrange the meeting had surprised him. He&#x2019;d not heard from her since Christmas, when she&#x2019;d spent a few days in Copenhagen. He&#x2019;d been cruising back home on his bicycle, enjoying the comfortable spring night, when he&#x2019;d decided to check out the unusual meeting location she&#x2019;d chosen, the Museum of Greco-Roman Culture&#x2013;a preparatory habit from his former profession. Cassiopeia rarely did anything on impulse, so a little advance preparation wasn&#x2019;t a bad idea. <br><br>He&#x2019;d found the address, which faced the Frederiksholms canal, and noticed a half-open door to the pitch-dark building&#x2013;a door that should normally be closed and alarmed. He&#x2019;d parked his bike. The least he could do was close the door and phone the police when he returned home. <br><br>But the last thing he remembered was grasping the doorknob. <br><br>He was now inside the museum. <br><br>In the ambient light that filtered in through two plate-glass windows, he saw a space decorated in typical Danish style&#x2013;a sleek mixture of steel, wood, glass, and aluminum. The right side of his head throbbed and he caressed a tender knot. <br><br>He shook the fog from his brain and stood. <br><br>He&#x2019;d visited this museum once and had been unimpressed with its collection of Greek and Roman artifacts. Just one of a hundred or more private collections throughout Copenhagen, their subject matter as varied as the city&#x2019;s population. <br><br>He steadied himself against a glass display case. His fingertips again came away sticky and smelly, with the same nauseating odor. <br><br>He noticed that his shirt and trousers were damp, as was his hair, face, and arms. Whatever covered the museum&#x2019;s interior coated him, too. <br><br>He stumbled toward the front entrance and tried the door. Locked. Double dead bolt. A key would be needed to open it from the inside. <br><br>He stared back into the interior. The ceiling soared thirty feet. A wood-and-chrome staircase led up to a second floor that dissolved into more darkness, the ground floor extending out beneath. <br><br>He found a light switch. Nothing. He lumbered over to a desk phone. No dial tone. <br><br>A noise disturbed the silence. Clicks and whines, like gears working. Coming from the second floor. <br>His training as a Justice Department agent cautioned him to keep quiet, but also urged him to investigate. <br><br>So he silently climbed the stairs. <br><br>The chrome banister was damp, as were each of the laminated risers. Fifteen steps up, more glass-and-chrome display cases dotted the hardwood floor. Marble reliefs and partial bronzes on pedestals loomed like ghosts. Movement caught his eye twenty feet away. An object rolling across the floor. Maybe two feet wide with rounded sides, pale in color, tight to the ground, like one of those robotic lawn mowers he&#x2019;d once seen advertised. When a display case or statue was encountered, the thing stopped, retreated, then darted in a different direction. A nozzle extended from its top and every few seconds a burst of aerosol spewed out. <br><br>He stepped close. <br><br>All movement stopped. As if it sensed his presence. The nozzle swung to face him. A cloud of mist soaked his pants. <br><br>What was this? <br><br>The machine seemed to lose interest and scooted deeper into the darkness, more odorous mist expelling along the way. He stared down over the railing to the ground floor and spotted another of the contraptions parked beside a display case. <br><br>Nothing about this seemed good. <br><br>He needed to leave. The stench was beginning to turn his stomach. <br><br>The machine ceased its roaming and he heard a new sound. <br><br>Two years ago, before his divorce, his retirement from the government, and his abrupt move to Copenhagen, when he&#x2019;d lived in Atlanta, he&#x2019;d spent a few hundred dollars on a stainless-steel grill. The unit came with a red button that, when pumped, sparked a gas flame. He recalled the sound the igniter made with each pump of the button. <br><br>The same clicking he heard right now. <br><br>Sparks flashed. <br><br>The floor burst to life, first sun yellow, then burnt orange, finally settling on pale blue as flames radiated outward, consuming the hardwood. Flames simultaneously roared up the walls. The temperature rose swiftly and he raised an arm to shield his face. The ceiling joined the conflagration, and in less than fifteen seconds the second floor was totally ablaze. <br><br>Overhead sprinklers sprang to life. <br><br>He partially retreated down the staircase and waited for the fire to be doused. <br><br>But he noticed something. <br><br>The water simply aggravated the flames. <br><br>The machine that started the disaster suddenly disintegrated in a muted flash, flames rolling out in all directions, like waves searching for shore. <br><br>A fireball drifted to the ceiling and seemed to be welcomed by the spraying water. Steam thickened the air, not with smoke but with a chemical that made his head spin. <br><br>He leaped down the stairs two at a time. Another swoosh racked the second floor. Followed by two more. Glass shattered. Something crashed. <br><br>He darted to the front of the building. <br><br>The other gizmo that had sat dormant sprang to life and started skirting the ground-floor display cases. <br>More aerosol spewed into the scorching air. <br><br>He needed to get out. But the locked front door opened to the inside. Metal frame, thick wood. No way to kick it open. He watched as fire eased down the staircase, consuming each riser, like the devil descending to greet him. Even the chrome was being devoured with a vengeance.<br> <br>His breaths became labored, thanks to the chemical fog and the rapidly vanishing oxygen. Surely someone would call the fire department, but they&#x2019;d be no help to him. If a spark touched his soaked clothes . . . <br><br>The blaze found the bottom of the staircase. <br><br>Ten feet away.</p><h2>Family Jewels (A Stone Barrington Novel)</h2><p><b>When Stone Barrington takes on a wealthy heiress as his client, he finds himself handling a whole lot of trouble in this &#x201c;this glossy, modern take on the classic detective story&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>).</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Stone Barrington&#x2019;s newest client is a poised lady of considerable wealth who&#x2019;s looking for help discouraging the attentions of a tenacious gentleman.

&#x201c;Very well, thank you,&#x201d; he said, struggling to his feet and extending a hand.&nbsp; &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t you sit down?&#x201d;<br><br> She shook his hand, then sat down across the desk from him and crossed her legs.&nbsp; &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would you like some coffee?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You look as though you need it more than I,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s enough for both of us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already had my morning coffee, and a second cup would just get me wired.&#x201d;<br><br> It was easier to focus on her sitting down, and, once he was able to focus, it was very pleasent, too.&nbsp; She had blonde hair, parted on the right and held back by a tortoise-shell clip.&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not working that way for me - not yet, anyway.&#x201d;&nbsp; He took another sip and didn&#x2019;t burn his tongue.<br><br> &#x201c;You look jet-lagged.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I am; thank you for not suggesting I have a hangover.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&nbsp; Where have you flown in from?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The south of England.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;London?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Farther south; Hampshire.<br>&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But you flew from London.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, from Hampshire.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you could do that - fly from Hampshire to New York.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You can, but you have to fly the airplane yourself.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And it would have to be a big enough airplane to have that kind of range.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, just big enough to make it to the Azores, then Newfoundland, then Teterboro.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And how big is that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You know Citations?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, my former husband owned one, until the bank took it away from him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A Citation M2.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh.&nbsp; I used to fly a Bonanza.&#x201d;<br><br> The conversation was cutting the fog, so he continued. &#x201c;So did I: a B-36TC.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mine was an A36.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sweet airplane, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was.&nbsp; My husband made me sell it when we got married; he was afraid to fly with me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The Swine.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Now that you mention it, yes.&nbsp; He&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you divorced?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, almost a year ago.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Did you get a satisfactory settlement?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, but he did.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Does he want more?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but he knows he has no chance of that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then what&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t leave me alone: he follows me, turns up at places I&#x2019;m going.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Does he bother you on those occasions?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes.&nbsp; Oh, he doesn&#x2019;t push me around or anything; he just stares at me unrelentingly.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a word for that: stalking.&nbsp; And there&#x2019;s a very useful New York State law against it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure there is, but it won&#x2019;t do me any good when I&#x2019;m dead.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Has he threatened you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t speak, he just stares.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But you think he wants to kill you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know he does.&nbsp; He told me right after we were married that if I ever left him, he&#x2019;d kill me.&nbsp; I have no reason to doubt him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How long were you married?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About five months, before I filed for divorce.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ve been divorced for nearly a year?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct.&#x201d;<br><br> Stone took a big swig of the coffee; it was clearing his head.&nbsp; &#x201c;Then why hasn&#x2019;t he killed you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He just isn&#x2019;t ready yet.&nbsp; Harvey was always a planner; I don&#x2019;t think that has changed.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone took a yellow pad from a desk drawer and picked up a pen.&nbsp; &#x201c;All right, let&#x2019;s start at the beginning: What is your name?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Carrie Jarman Fisk.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jarman?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;My father was in shoes; Jarman shoes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I see.&nbsp; Address?&#x201d;<br><br> She gave him a very, very good Park Avenue address.<br><br> &#x201c;Age?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s rude.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing, forty . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thirty-four.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That was my first guess.&nbsp; Are you employed, Ms. Fisk?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Self-employed; I&#x2019;m an investor.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Any children?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;None; I took precautions.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What is your ex-husband&#x2019;s name?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Harvey Biggers.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is he employed?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What is his business?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Managing my money.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Before that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Managing other peoples&#x2019; money.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Was he successful at managing your money?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He would have been an abject failure, if I had listened to him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Beg pardon?&nbsp; He didn&#x2019;t have control of your funds?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Certainly not, I may have been stupid to marry him, but I&#x2019;m not crazy.&nbsp; He <i>thought</i> he managed my money, but he had no control of it.&nbsp; He would say, &#x201c;Sell Apple,&#x201d; and I&#x2019;d pretend to call my broker and tell him to sell Apple.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So you never sold Apple?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not; my father left those shares to me, 25,000 of them; also 10,000 shares of a very nice company called Berkshire-Hathaway.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Your father was a good stock picker.&nbsp; How long ago did he leave you these shares?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He died when I was seven.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You said he was in shoes?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He was a traveling salesman; he sold men&#x2019;s suits and shoes to stores all over the southeast.&nbsp; But he was also a very good poker player, very shrewd.&nbsp; He played poker almost every night for forty years when he was on the road, and he banked his winnings.&nbsp; Then, once a month, he would invest them.&nbsp; The shares were put into a trust when he died, and I got control when I was twenty-five.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And when you divorced, what did you have to give your husband?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A hundred thousand dollars.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That was it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yep; I wrote him a check, moved his stuff out of my apartment, changed the locks and told the doormen to call the police if he ever showed up.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Did you have a restraining order against him?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, one that prevents him from coming closer to me than a hundred feet, and he neverhas.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re legally divorced, your settlement was paid, and he hasn&#x2019;t violated the TRO?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That is correct.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then there&#x2019;s nothing we can do.&nbsp; Legally.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How about illegally?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, no, don&#x2019;t even think that.&nbsp; Do you have your ex-husband&#x2019;s address?&#x201d;<br><br> She gave him the number of an apartment building on Second Avenue.&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a studio,&#x201d; she said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I suppose he&#x2019;s living frugally.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you have a will?&#x201d;<br><br>She blinked.&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes; I forgot.&nbsp; And he&#x2019;s the sole heir..&nbsp; How could I forget that?&#x201d;&nbsp; She slapped her forehead.<br><br> &#x201c;Where is the original of the will?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in my safe, in my apartment.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, when it&#x2019;s convenient, get it to me.&nbsp; In the meantime, let&#x2019;s draw a new will.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Right now?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The sooner the better,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp; &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll send your ex-husband a copy.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><b>2</b><br><br> Stone put away his pad.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have this typed up and messengered to you.&nbsp; You can come back here and execute it after you&#x2019;ve checked it over.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The doormen in my building often witness documents for me; I&#x2019;ll get them to do it and save a trip back.<br><br> &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;do you mind having some company for a few days?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you volunteering?&#x201d; she asked, a little smile on her face.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m volunteering a man who works for me; his name is Fred Flicker, and he is very competent.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And what will his duties be?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To see that you move about safely, and to frighten your ex-husband.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Harvey was a boxing champion at Yale,&#x201d; she said.&nbsp; &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t frighten easily.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t met Fred Flicker.&nbsp; Shall I introduce you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All right.&#x201d;<br><br> Stone buzzed Joan.&nbsp; &#x201c;Please ask Fred to join us.&#x201d;&nbsp; He hung up the phone.&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be just a moment.&#x201d;<br><br> A moment later, Fred Flicker entered the room.&nbsp; &#x201c;You rang, sir?&#x201d;&nbsp; Fred Flicker would have been about five-six, if he wore heels, which he did not.<br><br> &#x201c;I did, Fred.&nbsp; This is Ms. Fiske; I would like you to accompany her everywhere she goes for the next few days.&nbsp; Her ex-husband has been following her, and when given the opportunity, I would like you to persuade him to discontinue that activity.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How much persuasion may I use, sir?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You may not harm him, except in self-defense.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Will he be armed?&#x201d;<br><br> Stone looked at Carrie and raised his eyebrows&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;He owns guns,&#x201d; she said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if he has been walking around armed.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Does he have a license to do so?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I expect not; do you mind if he is sent to prison for a while?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For killing me?&nbsp; For a very long time, please.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, for carrying a gun illegally.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure, why not?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fred, if you learn that Mr. Harvey Biggers - that&#x2019;s his name - is carrying, take steps.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Quite, sir.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You may go and get the car, Fred.&nbsp; Ms. Fisk will meet you outside momentarily.&#x201d;<br><br> Fred disappeared.<br><br>&#x201c;You really think this is going to work?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Very probably.&nbsp; Bullies don&#x2019;t like being confronted by those they have not chosen to bully.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Harvey is a bully, now that you mention it, but I&#x2019;m not sure that little man will frighten him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That little man, as you describe him, is a retired regimental sergeant of the Royal Marine Commandos.&nbsp; He is extraordinarily qualified to frighten bullies.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to see this.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then go somewhere today where you think Harvey might follow you.&nbsp; Fred is waiting outside in my car.&nbsp; I would like him to drive you anywhere you wish to go.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For how long?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Until Harvey vanishes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, getting to her feet, &#x201c;I guess this is worth a try.&nbsp; What do we do if it doesn&#x2019;t work?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll cross that gutter when we come to it.&#x201d;&nbsp; Stone shook her hand, and she left his office.&nbsp; He heard the outside door close behind her.<br><br> Joan came in.&nbsp; &#x201c;What was she about?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About an ex-husband who won&#x2019;t leave her alone.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, one of those.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, one of those.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You seem to have known a number of women with ex-husbands or boyfriends like that.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It has been my lot in life to know such women.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You attract them the way other people attract mosquitos; how did you attract this one?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I forgot to ask her who recommended me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She reminds me of a young Lauren Bacall.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Me, too.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t start thinking you&#x2019;re Humphrey Bogart,&#x201d; she said, then went back to her desk.&nbsp; A moment later she buzzed him.&nbsp; &#x201c;Dino on one.&#x201d;<br><br> Stone picked up the phone.&nbsp; &#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not bad,&#x201d; Dino replied.&nbsp; Back when Stone had been an NYPD detective, he and Dino had been partners.&nbsp; Dino had prospered and was now the New York City Police Commissioner.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you&#x2019;re not jet-lagged,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br> &#x201c;I got some sleep on the airplane, while you were working in the front office.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I wish I could say that,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I woke up feeling like one of the undead.&nbsp; Funny, though, I feel better now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you get over that?&nbsp; It&#x2019;s too early in the morning for you to have met a new woman.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><b>3</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br> Fred Flicker had a good look at Ms. Fisk as he held open the door of the Bentley.&nbsp; Pretty good, he thought, but Fred was a harsh judge of flesh.&nbsp; He got into the driver&#x2019;s seat.<br><br> &#x201c;And where would you like to go, Madam?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Madam?&nbsp; Really?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Would you prefer Miss?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Infinitely.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Where would you like to go, Miss?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Home?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Would you like to give me a hint?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry; 740 Park Avenue.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Miss.&#x201d; Fred put the car in gear and drove away.&nbsp; Fifteen minutes later he pulled to a stop in front of her building, got out and opened the door for her.<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you, Fred.&#x201d;<br><br> He handed her a card.&nbsp; &#x201c;Please call me at this number when you&#x2019;re ready to go out, Miss.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll be here in five minutes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather just go to lunch now; I&#x2019;m presentable; no need to go upstairs.&#x201d;&nbsp; She got back into the car.<br><br> Fred mounted the driver&#x2019;s seat again.&nbsp; &#x201c;Where to, Miss?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The boathouse in Central Park,&#x201d; she said, dialing a number on her cell phone.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Miss.&#x201d;&nbsp; Ten minutes later they were there.&nbsp; Fred assisted her from the car, then parked it and followed her into the restaurant.&nbsp; She was seated at an outside table, overlooking the lake.&nbsp; A woman entered, they air-kissed, and the two women sat down together.&nbsp; <br><br> Fred stood to one side of the seating area and was approached by the headwaiter.<br><br> &#x201c;May I help you?&#x201d; the man asked, in a tone that sounded as if he had no wish to help.<br><br> &#x201c;Security,&#x201d; Fred said, nodding toward the Fisk table.<br><br> &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Really; trust me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, all right.&#x201d;&nbsp; He stalked away.<br><br> A moment later he returned, leading a large, handsome gentleman.&nbsp; Fred looked him over: six-five, maybe six-six, two-twenty, chiseled features, square jaw.&nbsp;

He aimed to venture more deeply into solitude, discovering its full extent and depth.<br> &nbsp;<br> This beautiful literary collage documents his multifaceted explorations. Spending time in remote places, appreciating and making art, practicing meditation and participating in retreats, drinking peyote and ayahuasca, and training himself to keep an open, questioning mind have all contributed to Batchelor&#x2019;s ability to be simultaneously alone and at ease. Mixed in with his personal narrative are inspiring stories from solitude&#x2019;s devoted practitioners, from the Buddha to Montaigne, and from Vermeer to Agnes Martin.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a hyperconnected world that is at the same time plagued by social isolation, this book shows how to enjoy the inescapable solitude that is at the heart of human life.</p><p><b>Stephen Batchelor</b> is a teacher and scholar of Buddhism.

Naturally, this will impair the ability of a person with autism to compose narratives, for the same reason that deaf composers are thin on the ground, or blind portraitists. While not belittling the Herculean work Naoki and his tutors and parents did when he was learning to type, I also think he got a lucky genetic/neural break: the manifestation of Naoki's autism just happens to be of a type that (a) permitted a cogent communicator to develop behind his initial speechlessness, and (b) then did not entomb this communicator by preventing him from writing. This combination appears to be rare.</p> <p><strong>AS: </strong>What, in your view, is the relationship between language and intelligence? How do autistic people who have no expressive language best manifest their intelligence?</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>It would be unwise to describe a relationship between two abstract nouns without having a decent intellectual grip on what those nouns are. Language, sure, the means by which we communicate: but intelligence is to definition what Teflon is to warm cooking oil. I feel most at home in the school that talks about 'intelligences' rather than intelligence in the singular, whereby intelligence is a fuzzy cluster of aptitudes: numerical, emotional, logical, abstract, artistic, 'common sense' &#x2013; and linguistic. In this model, language is one subset of intelligence &#x2013; and, Homo sapiens being the communicative, cooperative bunch that we are, rather a crucial one, for without linguistic intelligence it's hard to express (or even verify the existence of) the other types. I guess that people with autism who have no expressive language manifest their intelligence the same way you would if duct tape were put over your mouth and a 'Men in Black'-style memory zapper removed your ability to write: by identifying problems and solving them. I want a chocky bicky, but the cookie jar's too high: I'll get the stool and stand on it. Or, Dad's telling me I have to have my socks on before I can play on his iPhone, but I'd rather be barefoot: I'll pull the tops of my socks over my toes, so he can't say they aren't on, then I'll get the iPhone. Or, This game needs me to add 7+4: I'll input 12, no, that's no good, try 11, yep...</p> <p><strong>AS: </strong>Naoki Higashida comes off as very charming, but describes being very difficult for his parents. Do you think that the slightly self-mocking humor he shows will give him an easier life than he'd have had without the charm? </p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Definitely. Humor is a delightful sensation, and an antidote to many ills. I feel that it is linked to wisdom, but I'm neither wise nor funny enough to have ever worked out quite how they intertwine.</p> <p><strong>AS: </strong>As you translated this book from the Japanese, did you feel you could represent his voice much as it was in his native language? Did you find that there are Japanese ways of thinking that required as much translation from you and your wife as autistic ways required of the author?</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Our goal was to write the book as Naoki would have done if he was a 13 year-old British kid with autism, rather than a 13 year-old Japanese kid with autism. Once we had identified that goal, many of the 1001 choices you make while translating became clear. Phrasal and lexical repetition is less of a vice in Japanese &#x2013;- it's almost a virtue &#x2013;- so varying Naoki's phrasing, while keeping the meaning, was a ball we had to keep our eyes on. Linguistic directness can come over as vulgar in Japanese, but this is more of a problem when Japanese is the Into language than when it is the Out Of language. The only other regular head-bender is the rendering of onomatopoeia, for which Japanese has a synaesthetic genius &#x2013; not just animal sounds, but qualities of light, or texture, or motion. Those puzzles were fun, though</p> <p><strong>AS: </strong>Higashida has written dream-like stories that punctuate the narrative. Can you say what functional or narrative purpose they serve in the book?</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Their inclusion was, I guess, an idea of the book's original Japanese editor, for whom I can't speak. But for me they provide little coffee breaks from the Q&amp;A, as well as showing that Naoki can write creatively and in slightly different styles. The story at the end is an attempt to show us neurotypicals what it would feel like if we couldn't communicate. The story is, in a way, <em>The Reason I Jump</em> but re-framed and re-hung in fictional form. They also prove that Naoki is capable of metaphor and analogy.</p> <p><strong>AS: </strong>The book came out in its original form in Japan some years ago. Do you know what has happened to the author since the book was published? </p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Naoki has had a number of other books about autism published in Japan, both prior to and after <em>Jump</em>. He's now about 20, and he's doing okay. He receives invitations to talk about autism at various universities and institutions throughout Japan. This involves him reading 2a presentation aloud, and taking questions from the audience, which he answers by typing. This isn't easy for him, but he usually manages okay. In terms of public knowledge about autism, Europe is a decade behind the States, and Japan's about a decade behind us, and Naoki would view his role as that of an autism advocate, to close that gap. (I happen to know that in a city the size of Hiroshima, of well over a million people, there isn't a single doctor qualified to give a diagnosis of autism.)</p>Naoki Higashida was born in Kimitsu, Japan in 1992. He was diagnosed with autism in 1998 and subsequently attended a school for students with special needs, then (by correspondence) Atmark Cosmopolitan High School, graduating in 2011. Having learnt to use a method of communication based on an alphabet grid, Naoki wrote The Reason I Jump when he was thirteen and it was published in Japan in 2007. He has published several books since, from autobiographical accounts about living with autism to fairy tales, poems and illustrated books, and writes a regular blog. Despite his communication challenges, he also gives presentations about life on the autistic spectrum throughout Japan and works to raise awareness about autism. In 2011 he appeared in director Gerry Wurzburg's documentary on the subject, Wretches &amp; Jabberers. David Mitchell is the author of the novels Ghostwritten, number9dream, Cloud Atlas, Black Swan Green and The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet. He has been shortlisted twice for the Man Booker Prize and won several awards for his writing.

A professional civil engineer, he lives near San Francisco with his wife and two sons, who are both geeks-in-training.<b>Introduction</b><p>About Being a Geek and a Dad</p><p>Once upon a time, the word <i>geek </i> was used to describe circusperformers. Then it evolved as a pejorative to describeawkward, skinny kids who got routinely thrown intoschool lockers by the high school football team. But these days, <i>geek</i>has reinvented itself. This is the era of the geek. And geeks arecool. </p><p>There is some interchangeability between <i>geek </i> and <i>nerd</i>. Theyboth generally describe someone of restricted social ability whofinds enjoyment in pursuits outside the mainstream&#x2014;pursuits likecomputers, role-playing games (RPGs), science fiction and fantasyliterature and movies, science and engineering, and so on&#x2014;you getthe idea. But there is a key difference between the geek and thenerd. </p><p>One renowned geek dad (and honorary GeekDad), Wil Wheaton,describes it pretty simply: A geek is a self-aware nerd. It makes a lotof sense to me&#x2014;I think geeks had those social issues growing upand liked all those things that weren&#x2019;t part of the popular culturein school, but we came to understand our nature and, in a veryK�bler-Ross kind of way, moved past the self-limiting aspects ofnerdhood to a state of acceptance, and even enjoyment, of our placein the universe. Which, in a funny way, helped us take care of someof those social issues, because a lot of us ended up actually gettingmarried and having kids (which totally rocks!). </p><p>I think part of the current ascendancy of geeks in general, andGeekDads specifically, is that there are a lot more geeky womenthan people realize, and some of us geeky guys were smart enoughto recognize our own kind and attempt to mate and perpetuate thesubspecies. </p><p>But before I get too far along, let me point out something important:Geeks aren&#x2019;t just about the computers and the D&amp;D and thepassion for anime and comic books. There&#x2019;s a whole lot more outthere that people get passionate about, even mildly obsessive about,that can qualify them as geeks. If you&#x2019;re so passionate about somethingthat you&#x2019;re not just good at it but can lose yourself doing it forlong periods of time (often to your social detriment), you may be ageek. If you carry encyclopedic knowledge about a topic and willjoyfully use it to act as the pedant whenever the subject is beingdiscussed, you may be a geek. If you have a room in your house devotedto a hobby that other family members avoid talking about,you may indeed be a geek. I&#x2019;m not talking about &#x201c;experts&#x201d; or&#x201c;professionals&#x201d;&#x2014;I&#x2019;m talking about the real deal. Here are some examples: </p><p>So, what are the factors that make up the geek? I&#x2019;d like to positthat the geek is a combination of common personality factors thatwe see in all sorts of people. Indeed, these factors taken aloneor only in pairs may lead to less desirable characters. See, for example,the Venn diagram below (talk about geeky!), where I&#x2019;ve describedthe possible combinations of key personality factors thatmake up the geek, and its associated stereotypes: Knowledgeability,Obsessiveness, and Social Skills. </p><p>Knowledgeability represents having significant stored informationwith easy recall. That knowledge may be broad and relativelyshallow&#x2014;the know-it-all&#x2014;or itmay cover only a few topics butbe deep and profound&#x2014;the expert/problem solver. </p><p>Obsessiveness is a person&#x2019;sability to lose himself in somethinghe has a passion for. Commonsymptoms include losingtrack of time while coding HTML/CSS or staying up until four a.m.to finish Portal because you hadto earn watching the final credits(and hearing that awesome JonathanCoulton song). </p><p>Social Skills can mean a lot ofthings, not all of which are aboutbeing &#x201c;popular,&#x201d; which geeks and nerds always feel they neverwere in their formative years. But geeks do at least have enoughpresence and personality to form lasting relationships, which helpsdifferentiate them. </p><p>So first, it&#x2019;s easy to tag all the stand-alones: Dorks are the peoplewho are obsessive without the introspection to recognize it in themselvesor how it could affect others. Dweebs know everything butcan&#x2019;t apply or express themselves. Goobers are good-natured butlazy idiots&#x2014;no one minds them, but they aren&#x2019;t much use. </p><p>It starts to get interesting when you begin combining the traits.The classic nerd has knowledge/intelligence AND the obsessive naturethat produces results. You can&#x2019;t expect them to carry on conversationsthat won&#x2019;t lose a non-nerd audience&#x2014;they would talkyour ear off about something as nerdy as the exciting application ofquantum theory on the flow of mold over a piece of cheese, but setthem to work on a project without distraction, and you&#x2019;ll be able tomine the results for pure gold (especially if it has to do with Worldof Warcraft and, you know, gold mining). </p><p>The twit&#x2014;well, I suppose there are other names for this person,probably a lot of regional variations&#x2014;but the twit combines obsessivenessand social skills into a double-edged sword. This could bethat sales guy who can talk up a storm but who really doesn&#x2019;t knowsquat, or it could be the diligent hard worker everyone likes butwho really just doesn&#x2019;t get it. </p><p>And then there&#x2019;s the gadfly. He&#x2019;s smart and he gets invited toparties, but he&#x2019;s lazy. Or worse, he&#x2019;s intellectually smart but emotionallyignorant, and doesn&#x2019;t care. He&#x2019;s the one most likely to bethe pedant in any gathering, and he probably uses people to get thework done he finds beneath him. </p><p>Of course those are extremes, and there are perfectly lovely,functional people who fall into those categories; but they&#x2019;re not theones we&#x2019;re here to talk about. In the sweet spot, right there in themiddle, is the tripartite synergy that creates the geek. The mixtureof knowledge (about comic books, particle physics, or the works ofMozart), obsessiveness (they&#x2019;ll sit in front of a computer or a workbenchfor hours perfecting, building, or playing anything), and socialskills (they actually get together with people for pen-and-paperRPGs or get in line with a bunch of friends to see the midnightshowing of the next Star Trek movie), that makes a well-rounded,self-sustaining person of affable oddity. </p><p>Now maybe weigh it just slightly toward the social skill set, andyou have someone who can actually get a date, find a mate, get married,and procreate. That, in a nutshell, is how a GeekDad comesinto being. The conditions need to continue to be favorable&#x2014;isthere support at home for ongoing geekiness? Will infecting thechild(ren) be allowed? How many times will the wife feign a chucklewhen you lift your little tyke and in a deep voice intone, &#x201c;Luke, Iam your father&#x201d; (knowing it&#x2019;s a misquote) before it gets old? Howmany jokes about containment breaches will be tolerated at diaperchangingtime? </p><p>It helps immeasurably when your mate is a geek, too (but that&#x2019;sanother book). I&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to have that situation in mymarriage. In fact, not only have my little quirks been tolerated, butsome of them have actually been encouraged. And in return, I encourageback. I mean, how many men can say their wives wanted atrip to a science fiction convention for their anniversary? I&#x2019;m onelucky man. </p><p>But the best part is getting to share with my kids, share thegeeky things that informed my childhood and continue to informmy existence: Star Wars, Star Trek, math, science, reading, writing,music, computers and video games, movies and television. I can&#x2019;ttell you the joy of having my kids get into <i>Doctor Who </i> and comicbooks and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and then talking with them about theimportant aspects of the stories and watching them just soak it up.I lived through the school years as a breed apart (though I hadgood friends who were geeks, too), so it makes me feel great to beable to inform and guide my kids through the social aspects, andthe occasional challenges, of growing up as a geek. All parents wantto protect their kids, but I like to think the best protection I canoffer them is to help them understand what will happen, why, andhow to best deal with it. I want them to know that different isn&#x2019;tbad, and that being intelligent and inquisitive is something to beproud of. </p><p>Indeed, that&#x2019;s what being a GeekDad really means for me. For allour personality quirks and interests in pursuits that are outside themainstream (or at least interests more technical than is usually palatablefor the mainstream), we&#x2019;re all about understanding, and communicating,and connecting with others by sharing what we loveand helping others to grok it as well. Of course there&#x2019;s a biologicalimperative to have kids and raise them to survive and thrive, butwe want them to be happy, too&#x2014;whatever happiness may mean tothem. </p><p>I&#x2019;ll encourage my kids to love what I do, but I won&#x2019;t force it onthem, and when they want to try something different, I&#x2019;m happy tolet them just as long as they come at it like a geek: They should beknowledgeable about it, be a little obsessive about it, and get alongwith the other people who are doing it. That&#x2019;s what all the greatestgeeks do. </p><p><b>Geeky Projects for Dads and Kids to Share</b></p><p>Most &#x201c;parenting&#x201d; books aren&#x2019;t about things you can do with yourkids. Most are about things to do to your kids, tricks and tactics fortweaking their behavior in some desired manner usually at oddswith what kids really want: to play, and spend real quality timewith you. </p><p>I&#x2019;m not saying all those books are bad. Some of them do try toreinforce the idea of spending quality time (though I&#x2019;d really like tofind a new phrase to replace quality time) with your kids. This bookhas the same goal of those others: to help you share time with yourkids in their formative years in constructive, educational ways,without making that time seem as if it&#x2019;s supposed to be constructiveor educational (not always easy). The difference here is thatfrom a geek&#x2019;s perspective, constructive and educational may notmean what all those other books think it means. Here&#x2019;s what makesour approach different: </p><p>- Geeks like games that require a fantastic imagination. </p><p>- Geeks love science and knowing how things work. Experimentation is the best way to learn those things. If things go&#x201c;boom&#x201d; in the process, all the better. </p><p>- Geeks love finding interesting, &#x201e; creative solutions for problemsthat could be solved in a more mundane fashion. </p><p>- Geeks love to play, but in playing, to build and learn aswell. </p><p>There is a plethora of projects included here about an eclecticarray of subjects, from board games to electronics, crafts to coding.But I&#x2019;m not here to tell you exactly what to do. The instructions aremeant give you a structure to start your adventure with your kids.Each of these projects will allow for extensive customization andpersonalization. Indeed, what I have in my workshop and availableat the hardware store in my town may be rather different from whatyou have. So I expect you to improvise, adapt, and even (quitelikely) improve on these projects. </p><p><b>Project Information</b></p><p>At the start of each project, you&#x2019;ll see a table with summary informationto give you an idea what to expect from it, and there aresome symbols not unlike what you see in a restaurant or hotel reviewto explain cost and difficulty. Here&#x2019;s a legend to explain theirmeaning. </p><p>One thing you&#x2019;ll notice as you go through the projects in thisbook is that they are not long, costly, or overly difficult and involvedprojects that take too much work before paying off in thefun department. If you and your kid have the kind of patience andgeeky determination to spend days/weeks/months on a project,then let me suggest you take up painting Warhammer armies ormapping the visible sky in your area with a telescope you builtfrom scratch. </p><p>It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t have respect for folks that do that kind ofthing! On the contrary, they are the epitome of geekhood, and I amnot worthy to clean their brushes or polish their lenses. I just don&#x2019;thave that kind of time or energy. I want to do something fun withmy kids NOW (or at least in the few minutes to couple of hours ittakes to complete any project in this book). So you&#x2019;ll find that themost important common features all these projects have is that theyare accessible, affordable, and truly buildable for just about anyonewith an ounce of geek in them. </p><p>Okay, it&#x2019;s time. Go get your kid(s) and get started!</p></p><h2>The Annotated Big Sleep</h2><p><b>The first fully annotated edition of Raymond Chandler&#x2019;s 1939 classic&nbsp;<i>The Big Sleep</i>&nbsp;features hundreds of illuminating notes and images alongside the full text of the novel and is an essential addition to any crime fiction fan&#x2019;s library.&nbsp;</b><br><br>A masterpiece of noir, Raymond Chandler's&nbsp;<i>The Big Sleep</i>&nbsp;helped to define a genre.

Kovacs can deal with the madness of AI. He can do his part in a battle against biomachines gone wild, search for a three-centuries-old missing weapons system, and live with a blood feud with the yakuza, and even with the betrayal of people he once trusted. But when his relationship with &#x201c;the&#x201d; Falconer brings him an enemy specially designed to destroy him, he knows it&#x2019;s time to be afraid. <br><br> After all, the guy sent to kill him is himself: but younger, stronger, and straight out of hell.<br><br> Wild, provocative, and riveting, Woken Furies is a full-bore science fiction spectacular of the highest order&#x2014;from one of the most original and spellbinding storytellers at work today.</p><p><b>Richard K.

The blaster bolt came in blind across my ribs, already weakened by the door plating it had to chew through to get to me. Priests, up against the slammed door and looking for a quick gut shot. Fucking amateur night. They&#x2019;d probably caught almost as much pain themselves from the point-blank blowback off the plating. Behind the door, I was already twisting aside. What was left of the charge plowed a long, shallow gash across my rib cage and went out, smoldering in the folds of my coat. Sudden ice down that side of my body and the abrupt stench of fried skin-sensor components. That curious bone-splinter fizzing that&#x2019;s almost a taste, where the bolt had ripped through the biolube casing on the floating ribs.<br><br> Eighteen minutes later, by the softly glowing display chipped into my upper left field of vision, the same fizzing was still with me as I hurried down the lamplit street, trying to ignore the wound. Stealthy seep of fluids beneath my coat. Not much blood. Sleeving synthetic has its advantages.<br><br> &#x201c;Looking for a good time, sam?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Already had one,&#x201d; I told him, veering away from the doorway. He blinked wave-tattooed eyelids in a dismissive flutter that said your loss and leaned his tightly muscled frame languidly back into the gloom. I crossed the street and took the corner, tacking between a couple more whores, one a woman, the other of indeterminate gender. The woman was an augment, forked dragon tongue flickering out around her overly prehensile lips, maybe tasting my wound on the night air. Her eyes danced a similar passage over me, then slid away. On the other side, the cross-gender pro shifted its stance slightly and gave me a quizzical look but said nothing. Neither was interested. The streets were rain-slick and deserted, and they&#x2019;d had longer to see me coming than the doorway operator. I&#x2019;d cleaned up since leaving the citadel, but something about me must have telegraphed the lack of business opportunity.<br><br> At my back, I heard them talking about me in Stripjap. I heard the word for broke.<br><br> They could afford to be choosy. In the wake of the Mecsek Initiative, business was booming. Tekitomura was packed that winter, thronging with salvage brokers and the deCom crews that drew them the way a trawler wake draws ripwings. Making New Hok Safe for a New Century, the ads went. From the newly built hoverloader dock down at the Kompcho end of town it was less than a thousand kilometers, straight-line distance, to the shores of New Hokkaido, and the &#x2019;loaders were running day and night. Outside of an airdrop, there is no faster way to get across the Andrassy Sea. And on Harlan&#x2019;s World, you don&#x2019;t go up in the air if you can possibly avoid it. Any crew toting heavy equipment&#x2014;and they all were&#x2014;was going to New Hok on a hoverloader out of Tekitomura. Those that lived would be coming back the same way.<br><br> Boomtown. Bright new hope and brawling enthusiasm as the Mecsek money poured in. I limped down thoroughfares littered with the detritus of spent human merriment. In my pocket, the freshly excised cortical stacks clicked together like dice.<br><br> There was a fight going on at the intersection of Pencheva Street and Muko Prospect. The pipe houses on Muko had just turned out and their synapse-fried patrons had met late-shift dockworkers coming up through the decayed quiet of the warehouse quarter. More than enough reason for violence. Now a dozen badly coordinated figures stumbled back and forth in the street, flailing and clawing inexpertly at each other while a gathered crowd shouted encouragement. One body already lay inert on the fused-glass paving, and someone else was dragging their body, a limb&#x2019;s length at a time, out of the fray, bleeding. Blue sparks shorted off a set of overcharged power knuckles; elsewhere light glimmered on a blade. But everyone still standing seemed to be having a good time, and there were no police as yet.<br><br> Yeah, part of me jeered. Probably all too busy up the hill right now.<br><br> I skirted the action as best I could, shielding my injured side. Beneath the coat, my hands closed on the smooth curve of the last hallucinogen grenade and the slightly sticky hilt of the Tebbit knife.<br><br> Never get into a fight if you can kill quickly and be gone.<br><br> Virginia Vidaura&#x2014;Envoy Corps trainer, later career criminal and sometime political activist. Something of a role model for me, though it was several decades since I&#x2019;d last seen her. On a dozen different worlds, she crept into my mind unbidden, and I owed that ghost in my head my own life a dozen times over. This time I didn&#x2019;t need her or the knife. I got past the fight without eye contact, made the corner of Pencheva, and melted into the shadows that lay across the alley mouths on the seaward side of the street. The timechip in my eye said I was late.<br><br> Pick it up, Kovacs. According to my contact in Millsport, Plex wasn&#x2019;t all that reliable at the best of times, and I hadn&#x2019;t paid him enough to wait long.<br><br> Five hundred meters down and then left into the tight fractal whorls of Belacotton Kohei Section, named centuries ago for the habitual content and the original owner-operator family whose warehouse frontages walled the curving maze of alleys. With the Unsettlement and the subsequent loss of New Hokkaido as any kind of market, the local belaweed trade pretty much collapsed and families like Kohei went rapidly bankrupt. Now the grime-filmed upper-level windows of their fa�ades peered sadly across at each other over gape-mouthed loading bay entrances whose shutters were all jammed somewhere uncommitted between open and closed.<br><br> There was talk of regeneration, of course, of reopening units like these and retooling them as deCom labs, training centers, and hardware storage facilities. Mostly, it was still just talk&#x2014;the enthusiasm had kindled on the wharf-line units facing the hoverloader ramps farther west, but so far it hadn&#x2019;t spread farther in any direction than you could trust a wirehead with your phone. This far off the wharf and this far east, the chitter of Mecsek finance was still pretty inaudible.<br><br> The joys of trickledown.<br><br> Belacotton Kohei Nine Point Twenty-six showed a faint glow in one upper window, and the long restless tongues of shadows in the light that seeped from under the half-cranked loading bay shutter gave the building the look of a one-eyed, drooling maniac. I slid to the wall and dialed up the synthetic sleeve&#x2019;s auditory circuits for what they were worth, which wasn&#x2019;t much. Voices leaked out into the street, fitful as the shadows at my feet.<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;telling you, I&#x2019;m not going to hang around for that.&#x201d;<br><br> It was a Millsport accent, the drawling metropolitan twang of Harlan&#x2019;s World Amanglic dragged up to an irritated jag. Plex&#x2019;s voice, muttering below sense-making range, made soft provincial counterpoint. He seemed to be asking a question.<br><br> &#x201c;How the fuck would I know that? Believe what you want.&#x201d; Plex&#x2019;s companion was moving about, handling things. His voice faded back in the echoes of the loading bay. I caught the words kaikyo, matter, a chopped laugh. Then again, coming closer to the shutter, &#x201c;&#x2014;matters is what the family believes, and they&#x2019;ll believe what the technology tells them. Technology leaves a trail, my friend.&#x201d; A sharp coughing and indrawn breath that sounded like recreational chemicals going down. &#x201c;This guy is fucking late.&#x201d;<br><br> I frowned. Kaikyo has a lot of meanings, but they all depend on how old you are. Geographically, it&#x2019;s a strait or a channel. That&#x2019;s early-Settlement-years use, or just hypereducated, kanji-scribbling, First Families pretension. This guy didn&#x2019;t sound First Family, but there was no reason he couldn&#x2019;t have been around back when Konrad Harlan and his well-connected pals were turning Glimmer VI into their own personal backyard. Plenty of DH personalities still on stack from that far back, just waiting to be downloaded into a working sleeve. Come to that, you wouldn&#x2019;t need to resleeve more than half a dozen times, end-to-end, to live through the whole of Harlan&#x2019;s World&#x2019;s human history anyway. It&#x2019;s still not much over four centuries, Earth-standard, since the colony barges made planetfall.<br><br> Envoy intuition twisted about in my head. It felt wrong. I&#x2019;d met men and women with centuries of continuous life behind them, and they didn&#x2019;t talk like this guy. This wasn&#x2019;t the wisdom of ages, drawling out into the Tekitomura night over pipe fumes.<br><br> On the street, scavenged into the argot of Stripjap a couple of hundred years later, kaikyo means a contact who can shift stolen goods. A covert flow manager. In some parts of the Millsport Archipelago, it&#x2019;s still common usage. Elsewhere, the meaning is shifting to describe aboveboard financial consultants.<br><br> Yeah, and farther south it means a holy man possessed by spirits, or a sewage outlet. Enough of this detective shit. You heard the man&#x2014;you&#x2019;re late.<br><br> I got the heel of one hand under the edge of the shutter and hauled upward, locking up the tidal rip of pain from my wound as well as the synthetic sleeve&#x2019;s nervous system would let me. The shutter ratcheted noisily to the roof. Light fell out into the street and all over me.<br><br> &#x201c;Evening.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; The Millsport accent jerked back a full step. He&#x2019;d been only a couple of meters away from the shutter when it went up.<br><br> &#x201c;Tak.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, Plex.&#x201d; My eyes stayed on the newcomer. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the tan?&#x201d;<br><br> By then I already knew. Pale, tailored good looks straight out of some low-end experia flick, somewhere between Micky Nozawa and Ryu Bartok. Well-proportioned fighter&#x2019;s sleeve, bulk in the shoulders and chest, length in the limbs. Stacked hair, the way they&#x2019;re doing it on the bioware catwalks these days, that upward static-twisted thing that&#x2019;s meant to look like they just pulled the sleeve out of a clone tank. A suit bagged and draped to suggest hidden weaponry, a stance that said he had none he was ready to use. Combat arts crouch that was more bark than readiness to bite. He still had the discharged micropipe in one curled palm, and his pupils were spiked wide open. Concession to an ancient tradition put illuminum-tattooed curlicues across one corner of his forehead.<br><br> Millsport yakuza apprentice. Street thug.<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t call me tani,&#x201d; he hissed. &#x201c;You are the outsider here, Kovacs. You are the intruder.&#x201d;<br><br> I left him at the periphery of my vision and looked toward Plex, who was over by the workbenches, fiddling with a knot of webbing straps and trying on a smile that didn&#x2019;t want to be on his dissipated aristo face.<br><br> &#x201c;Look, Tak&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This was strictly a private party, Plex. I didn&#x2019;t ask you to subcontract the entertainment.&#x201d;<br><br> The yakuza twitched forward, barely restrained. He made a grating noise deep in his throat. Plex looked panicked.<br><br> &#x201c;Wait, I . . .&#x201d; He put down the webbing with an obvious effort. &#x201c;Tak, he&#x2019;s here about something else.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s here on my time,&#x201d; I said mildly.<br><br> &#x201c;Listen, Kovacs. You fucking&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; I looked back at him as I said it, hoping he could read the bright energy in my tone for what it was. &#x201c;You know who I am, you&#x2019;ll stay out of my way. I&#x2019;m here to see Plex, not you. Now get out.&#x201d;<br><br> I don&#x2019;t know what stopped him, Envoy rep, late-breaking news from the citadel&#x2014;because they&#x2019;ll be all over it by now, you made such a fucking mess up there&#x2014;or just a cooler head than the cheap-suited punk persona suggested. He stood braced in the door of his own rage for a moment, then stood down and displaced it, all poured into a glance at the nails of his right hand and a grin.<br><br> &#x201c;Sure. You just go ahead and transact with Plex here. I&#x2019;ll wait outside. Shouldn&#x2019;t take long.&#x201d;<br><br> He even took the first step toward the street. I looked back at Plex.<br><br> &#x201c;What the fuck&#x2019;s he talking about?&#x201d;<br><br> Plex winced.<br><br> &#x201c;We, uh, we need to reschedule, Tak. We can&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh no.&#x201d; But looking around the room I could already see the swirled patterns in the dust where someone had been using a grav lifter. &#x201c;No, no, you told me&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I-I know, Tak, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I paid you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you the money&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want the fucking money, Plex.&#x201d; I stared at him, fighting down the urge to rip his throat out. Without Plex, there was no upload. Without the upload&#x2014;&#x201c;I want my fucking body back.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cool, it&#x2019;s cool. You&#x2019;ll get it back. It&#x2019;s just right now&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just right now, Kovacs, we&#x2019;re using the facilities.&#x201d; The yakuza drifted back into my line of sight, still grinning. &#x201c;Because to tell the truth, they were pretty much ours in the first place. But then Plex here probably didn&#x2019;t tell you that, did he?&#x201d;<br><br> I shuttled a glance between them. Plex looked embarrassed.<br><br> You gotta feel sorry for the guy. Isa, my Millsport contact broker, all of fifteen years old, razored violet hair and brutally obvious archaic datarat plugs, working on world-weary reflective while she laid out the deal and the cost. Look at history, man. It fucked him over but good.<br><br> History, it was true, didn&#x2019;t seem to have done Plex any favors. Born three centuries sooner with the name Kohei, he&#x2019;d have been a spoiled stupid younger son with no particular need to do more than exercise his obvious intelligence in some gentleman&#x2019;s pursuit like astrophysics or archaeologue science. As it was, the Kohei family had left its post-Unsettlement generations nothing but the keys to ten streets of empty warehouses and a decayed aristo charm that, in Plex&#x2019;s own self-deprecating words, made it easier than you&#x2019;d think to get laid when broke. Pipe-blasted, he told me the whole shabby story on less than three days&#x2019; acquaintance. He seemed to need to tell someone, and Envoys are good listeners. You listen, you file under local color, you soak it up. Later, the recalled detail maybe saves your life.<br><br> Driven by the terror of a single life span and no resleeve, Plex&#x2019;s newly impoverished ancestors learned to work for a living, but most of them weren&#x2019;t very good at it. Debt piled up; the vultures moved in. By the time Plex came along, his family were in so deep with the yakuza that low-grade criminality was just a fact of life. He&#x2019;d probably grown up around aggressively slouched suits like this one. Probably learned that embarrassed, give-up-the-ground smile at his father&#x2019;s knee.<br><br> The last thing he wanted to do was upset his patrons.<br><br> The last thing I wanted to do was ride a hoverloader back to Millsport in this sleeve.<br><br> &#x201c;Plex, I&#x2019;m booked out of here on the Saffron Queen. That&#x2019;s four hours away. Going to refund me my ticket?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll flicker it, Tak.&#x201d; His voice was pleading. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s another &#x2019;loader out to EmPee tomorrow evening. I&#x2019;ve got stuff, I mean Yukio&#x2019;s guys&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;use my fucking name, man,&#x201d; yelped the yakuza.<br><br> &#x201c;They can flicker you to the evening ride, no one&#x2019;s ever going to know.&#x201d; The pleading gaze turned on Yukio. &#x201c;Right? You&#x2019;ll do that, right?&#x201d;<br><br> I added a stare of my own. &#x201c;Right? Seeing as how you&#x2019;re fucking up my exit plans currently?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You already fucked up your exit, Kovacs.&#x201d; The yakuza was frowning, head-shaking. Playing at sempai with mannerisms and a clip-on solemnity he&#x2019;d probably copied directly from his own sempai not too far back in his apprenticeship. &#x201c;Do you know how much heat you&#x2019;ve got out there looking for you right now? The cops have put in sniffer squads all over uptown, and my guess is they&#x2019;ll be all over the &#x2019;loader dock inside an hour. The whole TPD is out to play. Not to mention our bearded stormtrooper friends from the citadel. Fuck, man, you think you could have left a little more blood up there.&#x201d; &#x201c;I asked you a question. I didn&#x2019;t ask for a critique. You going to flicker me to the next departure or not?&#x201d;</p><h2>Meet Me in Monaco: A Novel of Grace Kelly&#39;s Royal Wedding</h2><p><p><strong>"A fragrant French bonbon of a book: love, glamour, perfume, and paparazzi all circling around the wedding of the century..."--Kate Quinn, <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of THE ALICE NETWORK and THE HUNTRESS.</strong></p><p><strong>Named one of <em>InStyle</em>'s best books to put in your totebag for the summer!</strong></p><p><strong>Named one of<em>&nbsp;Popsugar</em>&#x2019;s best books to put in your beachbag this summer and one of the best books of July!</strong></p><p><strong>Set in the 1950s against the backdrop of Grace Kelly&#x2019;s whirlwind romance and unforgettable wedding to Prince Rainier of Monaco, New York Times bestselling author Hazel Gaynor and Heather Webb take the reader on an evocative sun-drenched journey along the C�te d&#x2019;Azur in this page-turning novel of passion, fate and second chances...</strong></p><p>Movie stars and paparazzi flock to Cannes for the glamorous film festival, but Grace Kelly, the biggest star of all, wants only to escape from the flash-bulbs.

Thomas Chatterton Williams, the son of a &#x201c;black&#x201d; father from the segregated South and a &#x201c;white&#x201d; mother from the West, spent his whole life believing the dictum that a single drop of &#x201c;black blood&#x201d; makes a person black. This was so fundamental to his self-conception that he&#x2019;d never rigorously reflected on its foundations&#x2015;but the shock of his experience as the black father of two extremely white-looking children led him to question these long-held convictions.</p><p>It is not that he has come to believe that he is no longer black or that his kids are white, Williams notes. It is that these categories cannot adequately capture either of them&#x2015;or anyone else, for that matter. Beautifully written and bound to upset received opinions on race, <em>Self-Portrait in Black and White</em> is an urgent work for our time.</p></p><p><strong>Thomas Chatterton Williams</strong> is the author of <em>Self-Portrait in Black and White</em>, <em>Losing My Cool</em>, and a contributing writer at the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>. He is a 2019 New America Fellow and the recipient of a Berlin Prize. He lives in Paris with his wife and children.&#x201c;[Williams] is so honest and fresh in his observations, so skillful at blending his own story with larger principles, that it is hard not to admire him. At a time of increasing division, his philosophizing evinces an underlying generosity. He reaches both ways across the aisle of racism, arguing above all for reciprocity, and in doing so begins to theorize the temperate peace of which all humanity is sorely in need.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew Solomon, <em>New York Times Book Review (cover)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An elegant and sharp-eyed writer....In a publishing environment where analyses of race tend to call out white fragilities and catalogue historical injustices, <em>Self-Portrait in Black and White</em> is a counterintuitive, courageous addition.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Carlos Lozada, <em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A fluent, captivating, if often disquieting story....We witness Williams on a journey of both self-discovery and self-creation, and his memoir is most valuable as a way deeper into, as opposed to a way out of, race talk.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Emily Bernard, <em>Harper's</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Thomas Chatterton Williams has the essential things a writer needs&#x2015;command of language, complexity and depth of thought, and, maybe above all, courage. In <em>Self-Portrait in Black and White</em> he sticks his neck way out in pursuit of unfashionable, necessary truths. This book brings a blast of fresh air that will change your thinking about race in America.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>George Packer, author of <em>Our Man</em> and <em>The Unwinding</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A gorgeously written and deeply knowledgeable account of fatherhood, identity, and race. Tender and probing, respectful of intellectual disagreement and of the raw emotions these subjects can stir, it nevertheless proceeds fearlessly and rigorously toward his own original and challenging conclusions. This is a book that will surely provoke, inform, and move readers, regardless of where they stand on the political and philosophical divide.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Phil Klay, author of <em>Redeployment</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An elegantly rendered and trenchantly critical reflection on &#x2018;race&#x2019; and identity&#x2015;one that is perfectly suited to our time. This is a subtle, unsettling, and brave book. Using his own journey through life as point of departure, Thomas Chatterton Williams launches a major assault on the conventional wisdom about racial categorization in America. Not only does he envision a New World; he dares to point the way toward how we all might yet arrive on those uncharted shores.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Glenn Loury, professor of economics and faculty fellow, Watson Institute, Brown University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A brave and powerful book that I could not put down. At a time when white supremacy is resurgent in many countries, should we fight it by insisting on the equality of the races or the elimination of race as a social and biological category? It is a question that needs to be asked and a debate that needs to be had.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Anne-Marie Slaughter, CEO, New America</strong><br><br>&#x201c;How does anyone confront a history that demands what they believe about themselves is different from what&#x2019;s required to love their children? The answer, and path to it, is complicated. But here is a son embodying the lessons of a father. Some will walk away from this believing that black, like white, is a social construct that needs to be abandoned&#x2015;but all will walk way knowing that a father&#x2019;s love cannot be quantified by anything as whimsical as skin complexion.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Reginald Dwayne Betts, author of <em>Felon</em> and <em>A Question of Freedom</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This small book poses a very large question: how to become a self? Williams uses his own story to remind us that inner freedom depends on escaping the insidious categories of history and the suffocating clich�s of the present. It is a stirring call to genuine liberation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mark Lilla, author of <em>The Once and Future Liberal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In fifty years, smart students will be writing senior theses seeking to understand why anyone in the early 21st century found anything in <em>Self-Portrait in Black and White</em> at all controversial. For now, curl up with this book to join a conversation on race about progress rather than piety, thought rather than therapy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John McWhorter, author of <em>The Creole Debate</em></strong></p><h2>Saving Jake: Blessings, Georgia Welcomes Home this Lonely Veteran with a Little Help from the Girl Next Door (Blessings, Georgia, 3)</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>USA Today</em> Bestseller!</strong></p><p>"Sharon Sala is a consummate storyteller.

After centuries of pogrom-like riots encouraged by the Church, the Jews - who have been an important part of Spanish life since the days of the Romans - are expelled from the country by royal edict. Many who wish to remain are intimidated by Church and Crown and become Catholics, but several hundred thousand choose to retain their religion and depart; given little time to flee, some perish even before they can escape from Spain.</p><p>Yonah Toledano, the 15-year-old son of a celebrated Spanish silversmith, has seen his father and brother die during these terrible days - victims whose murders go almost unnoticed in a time of mass upheaval. Trapped in Spain by circumstances, he is determined to honor the memory of his family by remaining a Jew.</p><p>On a donkey named Moise, Yonah begins a meandering journey, a young fugitive zigzagging across the vastness of Spain. Toiling at manual labor, he desperately tries to cling to his memories of a vanished culture. As a lonely shepherd on a mountaintop he hurls snatches of almost forgotten Hebrew at the stars, as an apprentice armorer he learns to fight like a Christian knight. Finally, as a man living in a time and land where danger from the Inquisition is everywhere, he deals with the questions that mark his past. How he discovers the answers, how he finds his way to a singular and strong Marrano woman, how he achieves a life with the outer persona of a respected Old Christian physician and the inner life of a secret Jew, is the fabric of this novel. The Last Jew is a glimpse of the past, an authentic tale of high adventure, and a tender and unforgettable love story. In it, Noah Gordon utilizes his greatest strengths, and the result is remarkable and moving.</p></p><p><p><b>Noah Gordon</b> has had outstanding international success, selling in Germany alone more than eight million copies of his recent trilogy (<i>The Physician, Shaman, </i>and <i>Matters of Choice</i>). The Society of American Historians awarded him the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Shaman as the best historical novel of 1991/1992. He was also voted "Novelist of the Year" by the readers of the Bertelsmann Book Club, and twice, in 1992 and 1995, he won the Silver Basque Prize for Spain's bestselling book. An earlier book, <i>The Rabbi</i>, was on the <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller list for 26 weeks. Noah Gordon lives with his wife in Brookline, Massachusetts.</p>Set in Spain under the Inquisition, this latest big historical novel from Gordon (Shaman; The Rabbi) follows the adventures of young Yonah Helkias as he stays true to his Jewish faith, escapes from misadventures and finds love. In Toledo, in 1489, a precious reliquary of a Christian saint, crafted by Yonah's silversmith father, disappears; Yonah's older brother, who was delivering the relic, is found dead; and compassionate physician Bernardo Espina begins to investigate the theft and murder. Meanwhile, the Inquisition starts to target Jews, including conversos like Espina (Jews by birth who have entered the Catholic church). The bulk of the novel takes place three years later, when the deadline for all Jews to leave Spain has arrived. Yonah, aged 13, joins thousands of his co-religionists headed for Spanish borders and ports, but instead of departing, Yonah remains behind. After witnessing Espina's death in an auto-da-f?, Yonah leads a fugitive existence as a farmer, a shepherd, a cathedral laborer, a pot repairer, a seaman and, finally, as an apprentice armorer under the demanding master Manuel Fierro. Delivering armor, he returns to Toledo, where he bargains with his family's persecutors to escape a dangerous rendezvous with relic smugglers. Then Yonah's master is fatally double-crossed; after avenging him, Yonah heads to Saragossa, where Fierro's brother trains him to becomeAlike the heroes of Gordon's The Physician and ShamanAa doctor. Yonah changes his name to Ramon Callico, marries a woman who knows his secret, but never gives up his desire to restore Espina's honor to his son, the stolen relic to the Church or his own soul to Judaism. Gordon has earned an international audience for his impressively documented historical narratives, his compassion for the trials of ?migr?s and his intricate descriptions of Renaissance crafts. Through a crowded landscape of characters and incidents, he illuminates the choices history forces on individualsAand, not incidentally, creates a grand, informative adventure and a completely engaging, unsentimental portrait of a turbulent time.

They influence virtually all of the growing individual's characteristics, from determining its sex to controlling the numbers of toes and fingers to shaping intricate details of brain structure.&nbsp;<br><br> Scientific research over the last 50 years has revealed that this hormonal control of development is vulnerable to disruption by synthetic chemicals. Through a variety of mechanisms, hormone-disrupting chemicals (also known as endocrine disrupting chemicals or endocrine disruptors) interfere with the natural messages and alter the course of development, with potential effects on virtually all aspects of bodily function.<br><br> <i>Our Stolen Future</i>&nbsp;explores the scientific discovery of endocrine disruption. The investigation begins with wildlife, as it was in animals that the first hints of widespread endocrine disruption appeared. The book then examines a series of experiments examining endocrine disruption of animals in the laboratory which show conclusively that fetal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals can wreak life-long damage. These experiments also reveal some of the biological processes by which these chemicals have their effects, and that endocrine disruption effects can be caused by exposure to infinitesimally small amounts of contaminant. Moving from animals to people,&nbsp;<i>Our Stolen Future</i>&nbsp;summarizes a series of well-studied examples where people have been affected by endocrine disrupting chemicals, most notably the synthetic hormone&nbsp;dietheylstilbestrol&nbsp;(DES), to which several million women were exposed through misguided medical attempts to manage difficult pregnancies in the 1950s, '60s and '70s.<br><br> <i>Our Stolen Future</i>&nbsp;then asks a broader, more difficult and more controversial set of questions. Given what is known from wildlife and laboratory studies, and from examples of well-studied human exposure, and given that exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals in the real world is widespread at levels comparable to those sufficient to cause animal harm, what effects should health scientists be looking for in people in general? Effects to be expected include declines in fertility and other impacts on the reproductive system of both men and women, impairments in disease resistance, and erosions in intelligence.</p><p>Dr. <b>Theo Colborn</b> was Professor at the University of Florida, Gainesville and President of&nbsp;TEDX (The Endocrine Disruption Exchange).

I is crying so hard, my body is shudder and breath and wet with tears. My glasses fog up and I wipe them with my shirt so I can see through them and see the back of my grandma, my guide. My heart feeling like it get bus&#x2019; up for calling somebody mother a jagabat.</p><p> Queenie is pure light and sweetness and obsidian skin. She smell like spicy earth things, like sandalwood and cinnamon and dirt itself. She is strong and warrior, moving through the trees like a river, carving her way through mud, elegant, dark and slow like the molasses she say we should invoke for this journey. She have on a long white dress, with a white scarf wrap around she short white hair and shoulders like a woman in prayer. The woods are a green and quiet bush between her house and ocean that I know very well. Too well. I have cover every part of them bush, with the bottom of my feet and the eyes of my soul since I young.&nbsp;</p><p> Queenie got silver bangles &#x2019;round she wrist like broken Saturn rings, jingling each of her movements through the forest. She moves with her walking stick made of bamboo and mahogany and wrapped tight in thin copper, rose quartz, and citrine, so it could be strong and light and absorb power. She takes the lead on our journey and let me cry in her wake.</p><p> Queenie stops quick and backs me up with her forearm. She looks up and reads the air. She smiles. She points and I see leaves whisper at us, shimmying with breeze and speaking Spirit. She looks at me to see if I am reading the signs. I barely able to lift my head, so soaked am I in my own river and ocean, my eyes cloudy. And to be real, I ain&#x2019;t want to see the full story yet.</p><p> I&#x2019;m already feeling a change. I&#x2019;ve been soaked in the feeling of Spirit&#x2019;s song since we started walking into the bush and up through the hills by Queenie&#x2019;s house. When Spirit speak to Queenie, she says she sees it first, and it feel like life become a dream and has a whisper of iridescence, &#x201c;like the world get soft before I get revelation.&#x201d; For me, it is different. The only way I can say it feels is like a tingle, a feeling, from the earth through water, and I is surrounded in a power that&#x2019;s bigger than me. Queenie can shape her magic like she feels, but I feel like mine shapes me, controls me. I can sometimes feel what anyone else feel, but I never know when or why I have to feel it.</p><p> I look at her, and my body still trembles. She pulls me up in her arm, while she holds us steady. She ain&#x2019;t afraid of my bawling, and she kisses me on both my cheeks and forehead, blessing me with my own tears and her Queenie love. She turns forward and keeps walking. My sob follows us and is whisper, then wail. We move into the curve of the hill like we&#x2019;re walking into heaven, then the path bends down and we are walking easier and I is feeling it, the pull of Our Water Mother, in my skin. I keep crying, following Queenie to the sea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Queenie swing an orange blanket onto the ground. She grab dried cocos, big rocks, and shells to secure the blanket into the sand. I is numb and just looking at the ocean and feeling like I is going to fall over. Queenie sit me down and pull out her machete and start busting fresh cocos she bring.</p><p> &#x201c;Drink dis, nuh. I sure you did dry yourself out, with all of that crying and grieving of love, my dahlin&#x2019;,&#x201d; she say, handing me a coco. &#x201c;Your first tabanca is a heartbreak that feel like a bit of death, yes. It hurt me to see you going through all of this hurt for love and your mother is totally out of place&#x2014;&#x201d; She stop talking before she finish that thought and she look like she is hurting too.</p><p> &#x201c;I know how it does feel, yes.&#x201d; She sucks she teeth, and I find it hard to believe Queenie ever was hurt for love like I is now.</p><p> We is on sand between edge of water and forest, and she asks for me to pull out my pouch. I hesitate, hoping that I can deny what I already feeling is true by not doing a reading. Still, I pull up my skirt and untie the pouch from my thick and dark-brown thigh. This is where I hide it from my mother and the world when I is traveling. Queenie asks me to drop my shells. I take them from the pouch and hold them in my hand. I feel the smooth indigo shards until I hear their song in my marrow. When their pitch is ripe, I throw them on the mat of lavender silk, raffia, and leather we use for reading our castings. The shells tumble around and reveal their message. Queenie nods and then looks up at me with her blue-rimmed brown eyes. She smiles, showing her ivory teeth with a gap twice the size of mine, but her eyes are sad. We can both read the confirmation.</p><p> The pathway is open, and this journey across the ocean is anointed for me to take. She says that tonight we will prepare a new pouch for me for the States; my child one has dried up its purpose. I touch the soft, faded, light-blue leather pouch. The one my mother don&#x2019;t know of. I sleep with it under my pillow at night, and it has held every dream I have had since I was nine.</p><p> Queenie pulls up her skirt to bring out her own pouch, deep-green-and-silver leather with a cowrie design. Whenever she does this, I feel like I looking up God&#x2019;s skirt. She have the prettiest legs to me. She starts rolling a spliff of lavender, damiana, marshmallow, and fresh ganja and does a quiet prayer to the spirits of the herbs, asking that they honor her temple. Queenie is beautiful and still look like she did in the pictures in her house from when she was a professional dancer. On our walks in the hills and the country, she moves like a gray-haired teenager, her legs are muscular and smooth with scars and dents that I have memorized and made her tell me each of their origin stories. My favorite scar, though, is the one she got on her cheek when she was being initiated as a young woman. That is all I know about it, but I love it &#x2019;cause it make she look real gangsta.</p><p> My grandma does only sometimes let me smoke with her after ritual. She says don&#x2019;t smoke with my Rasta cousins, Episode and them. &#x201c;Just us old ladies know how to do everything right with ritual and sweetness,&#x201d; she say with a wink and smile, revealing her back four teeth, which are dipped in gold. Queenie can roll a spliff faster than it take to light the flame. When we first started to take our walks together, I was nine and I used to love to just watch the smoke push wild from her mouth and circle her head into a cloud. Now I is sixteen, and she passes the fire my way and lets the news of my imminent trip sink in.</p><p> &#x201c;I always barefoot and I ain&#x2019;t wan&#x2019; lose my roots. I know I go miss the ancestors. I Aquarian and Oya.&#x201d; I crying all of these things, and Queenie corrects me.&nbsp;</p><p> &#x201c;Audre, you are a wild nurturing. You are a complicated specialness. You are ancestral perseverance and sacred erotic,&#x201d; she says, like she praying, holding me close to her. I cry louder.</p><p> &#x201c;Gyal, you been in constant communication with Spirit your whole life and you been taught that Spirit speak loudest when we deep in the water, drowning in trouble and fear.&#x201d; Queenie suddenly closes her eyes and is quiet and breathing, which I know means she is receiving messages. &#x201c;And that is when you must let yourself get quiet and still. You must let yourself float above it until you are safe and levitating on the water and beneath the sky and just listen, Audre.&#x201d; She opens her eyes and looks at me. &#x201c;And, dahlin&#x2019;, let me tell you something for truth: America have dey spirits too, believe me,&#x201d; she say, and she puts out her spliff, rubs my back, and starts humming a song into my spine. It a quiet and low song, and I feel my heart inhale the love of it.</p><p> &#x201c;Audre, I was at a ceremony in Brooklyn in &#x2019;84. The brothas and sistas in there, from everywhere&#x2014;Cuba, Nigeria, Mississippi, Peru, and India&#x2014;and they beatin&#x2019; them drums good, gyal.&#x201d; I look from the ocean and up at my grandmother and her storytelling. &#x201c;And I is with Auntie Mahal, who bring she cavaquinho and play it good right with them drums and she almost in a trance. You woulda think we was back in the motherland. But every land is a mother&#x2019;s land, I discover.&#x201d; She laughs at this thought. &#x201c;And I is in there, winin&#x2019; and spinnin&#x2019; and slicin&#x2019; my arms in the air, gyal, &#x2019;cause the rhythm find me and hold me. They is in their singing. I swear I was going to disappear, but I can&#x2019;t stop.&#x201d; Queenie stands up and starts twirling and twisting she arms in the air with her barefoot drumming on the sand.</p><p> I can never cry when Queenie dances.</p><p> &#x201c;And, Audre, somethin&#x2019; take over.&#x201d; She starts to kneel down low, her movements flowing and soft. With each cypher she is lifting and ascending into the air. The sound of drums seems to be coming from my heartbeat. Her feet are flying sand all around her, until I see my grandma rising above me. She is in the rapture of her memory. I lie back and watch her flowy, all-white attire, a cloud of origami, fold and contain and blossom her from movement to movement as she hovers above me several feet in the air. I watch her embrace the sky and the sky lift she up like a child of feather. She whipping in the wind, living in the rhythm of the breeze she create. After she finishes her celestial windup, she starts to descend, stair-stepping on air. Once her feet touch the ground, she crouches down next to me. She is laughing hard, and it rumble the ground beneath me. She fall back and lie on the sand, heart toward the sky.</p><p> &#x201c;Crazy, nuh? I feel I is not in my body no more; I feel I is of some next world. I ain&#x2019;t know I could do dat until dis day in the States of all places, I tellin&#x2019; ya. But, Audre, that is when I begin the journey to figure out my spirit, who I is, for real.&#x201d; She gets up and moves to sit next to me, and we look on the water together. I lie into she shoulder, wanting to feel the wind and sky she pull down cool my chest and lift up the space my heart is crumpled in.</p><p> &#x201c;Life is strange, and it will break you to help you heal ancient wounds, me dahlin&#x2019;.&#x201d; She rubs my back and my head fall into her lap.</p><p>My tears fall across her thighs. I really don&#x2019;t want to leave. I don&#x2019;t know if I ever going to see Neri again. I feel like I don&#x2019;t exist if Neri don&#x2019;t look at me. I miss the pulse of holding Neri&#x2019;s hand and I caved in with suffering, missing Neri&#x2019;s body next to mine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter 2: Mabel</b></p><p>I&#x2019;m trying to sleep and I can&#x2019;t sleep. My belly hurts and my hips too. All I can do is lie in bed and think of young Whitney Houston from the eighties. I have her album <i>Whitney</i> next to my bed. I found it at the thrift store last week when I was there with my mama, and I been sleeping next to Whitney every night ever since. My mom thinks it&#x2019;s cute since Whitney was her idol growing up, and she was inspired by her singing and style and stuff. But I feel like Whitney and I are connected in a special way for some reason. I have loved her since I was a kid, when my mom and I would play her greatest hits and dance to &#x201c;I Wanna Dance with Somebody.&#x201d; At the part when Whitney says, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you wanna dance? Say you wanna dance! Don&#x2019;t you wanna dance?!&#x201d; Mama would pull my dad in. He would do his reliable and raggedy two-step, thinking he is killing the game and she would be in her intricate Afro-modern-hip-hop choreography&#x2014;which is a lot of shoulder-shimmying, lyric dancing, and old-lady twerking. My mom can dance though, for real, and she could always get my dad to just let go and be goofy.</p><p> Anyway, I&#x2019;m up staring at my ceiling, in my memories and my feels as usual, listening to my &#x201c;quiet storm&#x201d; mix (as my dad calls it). It&#x2019;s all emo and soft music. Soon, I&#x2019;m thinking of Whitney and her fine self from back in the day again. She just had a lot of layers to her, which is a thing I think I like in people, like Ursa and Jazzy. Even Terrell has layers. I like that sometimes Whitney was graceful and poised like a church lady, but she was really kind of wild and cray, and straight hood, too.</p><p>I&#x2019;m like that, I got a lot of layers too, but I think other kids think I&#x2019;m just this whatever tomboy Black girl, who always reading and playing ball or working out or something. I basically fit in, which is okay, but sometimes, I wish I felt comfortable to put my layers out there more.</p><p> If I&#x2019;m honest, part of my renewed curiosity is because recently I found out Whitney Houston fell in love with this other girl, Robyn, when they was teens and working a summer job in New Jersey. I was just looking stuff up online and found some things about her &#x201c;rumored romance&#x201d; with her basketball-player best friend, Robyn. I don&#x2019;t know, but it just seems cool to know that she had this connection with this other girl. And that the other girl was a beautiful <i>basketball</i> star, and Whitney fell for her butt, called her the &#x201c;sister she never had.&#x201d; <i>Mmm-hmmm</i>. I feel that. I think I&#x2019;ve felt that way before. With Ursa, my bestie, I felt that somewhat and in another kind of weird way with Jada, this girl from math.</p><p> I read that when Whitney hit it big, Robyn was her for-real, ride or die. That she became Whitney&#x2019;s assistant and her confidante <i>and</i> always had her back. For real, for real. They shared a huge apartment together that was bad and beautiful and was living that good life together.</p><p> When I listen to &#x201c;I Wanna Dance with Somebody&#x201d; after reading more about their connection, I imagine Whitney and Robyn slow-dancing in an icy and lit penthouse in the eighties and it&#x2019;s all back-in-the-day fresh. A world of windows, looking over the city lights and skyscrapers, black and white everything, with leather couches, a big sound system with mad tapes and CDs, glass tables and a neon chandelier. Old-school and tasteful. They are two Black girls, slow-dancing, teen twin flames who loved each other. Inseparable.</p><p> I feel it.</p><p> Anyway, some people deny it, but when I look at pictures of young Robyn and Whitney and how they are smiling and close, a part of me thinks it&#x2019;s true. I just do. I can totally see why Whitney loved her. She is cool and smooth, more swag than any of those cheesy, Jheri-curled dudes probably trying to push up on her. I also read that one time, Robyn also maybe whooped Bobby Brown&#x2019;s butt. I wanna be like that&#x2014;smooth like Robyn. Just a tender thug who Whitney would love.</p><p> Maybe Robyn was her true love. I wish she coulda stayed with her if that&#x2019;s what she wanted, and they&#x2019;d be in love forever. Maybe the world would&#x2019;ve loved her if she was queer. I would&#x2019;ve, no doubt. Whitney was an angel and what if Robyn could&#x2019;ve been her bodyguard? Why did that basic-white-boy Kevin Costner, with no swag, have to save her? It should&#x2019;ve been Robyn&#x2019;s cool self. Ain&#x2019;t Black women always saving everything anyway? Why can&#x2019;t we save Whitney?</p><p> When I listen to Whitney sing, I&#x2019;m feeling every feel there is to feel. Lighthearted. Melancholy. Joyous. Romantic. Her voice can do anything, and I get chills hearing her riff and vocalize. I put my head under my blankets, bring my knees to my chest and cocoon myself with Whitney and the darkness and softness surrounds me.</p></p><h2>The Rape Recovery Handbook: Step-by-Step Help for Survivors of Sexual Assault</h2><p><p>A woman is raped in this country every two minutes; this guide provides an effective framework for victims to heal from the experience.</p> <p>If you are a survivor of sexual assault, you may be suffering from symptoms of depression, substance abuse, an eating disorder, panic and anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The changing realities of church and theological education, the diversity of our classrooms, and our increasingly complex community contexts leave us in search of tools to help train a rising generation of preachers for a future whose contours are far from clear.

They aim to help preachers to become more attuned to the Spirit, more adept in preaching's component skills, and more self-aware about all that is at stake in proclaiming the redemptive work of God in specific contexts.</p></p><p><p>Sally A. Brown is Princeton Seminary's Elizabeth M. Engle Associate Professor of Preaching and Worship. She encourages preaching strategies that enliven listeners' imagination, equipping them to risk creative public witness to God' redemptive work in ordinary life. Her book <i>Cross Talk: Preaching Redemption Here and Now</i>, was listed among the Academy of Parish Ministry's top ten books of 2008.</p><p>Luke A. Powery is the dean of Duke University Chapel and associate professor of homiletics at Duke Divinity School, Durham, North Carolina. He has also taught at Princeton Theological Seminary and is an ordained Baptist minister. His most recent book is <i>Dem Dry Bones: Preaching, Death, and Hope</i> (Fortress Press, 2012).</p>&#34;Sally A. Brown and Luke A. Powery do a wonderful job of encouraging students to think of preaching as dancing on the grave of despair. They model the kind of collaboration they hope students will use in learning this sacred task from one another. Few preaching books address so well the issue of diversity in the classroom, and fresh winds blow though this one in part because of the robust theology of the Spirit the authors sing about. They make it difficult for readers not to join them in song.&#34; --Paul Scott Wilson, Emmanuel College, University of Toronto</p><h2>Mastering Regular Expressions</h2><p><p>Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool for manipulating text and data.

In UNDERSTANDING JESUS, author Joe Amaral delves deep into Jewish history, societal mores, and cultural traditions, closing the gap created by geographical distance and over two thousand years of history. Using a chronological approach to the life of Christ, he guides the reader through significant events such as Jesus' birth, baptism, and crucifixion, pointing out illuminating details that that the Western mind would normally miss.<br>Amaral's premise is that to understand Jesus, we must understand the time and place in which he was born, the background from which he drew his illustrations, and the audience he spoke to. Throughout the book he explores specific terms, places, and events for their significance and shows how they add richness and meaning to the text. Topics include the connection between Jesus and John the Baptist, the annual Feasts and why they are important to modern Christianity, Jewish customs such as foot-washing, clean and unclean foods, paying tribute to political governments, and the significance of various miracles.<br>In UNDERSTANDING JESUS, Amaral draws back the curtain on a way of life that existed during the reign of the Caesars, and in doing so, reveals truths about the way we live more than two thousand years later, half a world away.</p><p><strong>Joe Amaral</strong> was born in Portugal on the island of St. Miguel, and immigrated with his family to Toronto, Ontario, when he was two years old. A rebel against Christianity, he credits a youth pastor who "loved me unconditionally" with being a major factor in his conversion and subsequent decision to enter the ministry. He attended Eastern Pentecostal Bible College (now a Master's College and Seminary). In November 2002, he first visited Israel, and learned about the culture from his tour guide, a Messianic Jew. Today, along with his father-in-law, he operates a ministry called Operation Outreach, conducting tours of the Holy Land several times a year and teaching on the Jewish roots of the Christian faith. He resides with his wife, Karen, and family in Ontario."The fact that Jesus took on Jewish flesh means that we can't fully appreciate what He said and did unless we know the Jewish culture of His day. Joe Amaral sheds significant new light on the person and work of the Messiah and by digging deeper into the Hebraic roots of the New Testament text."&#x2015;<b><i>Wayne Hilsden, Senior Pastor, King of Kings Community, Jerusalem</i></b><br><br>Joe Amaral's UNDERSTANDING JESUS is a must read for anyone who is serious about determining the true meaning of Jesus' teachings. Amaral's knowledge of First Century Jewish life presents Jesus in His original cultural context. In doing so, many misunderstood or difficult passages are brought to life."&#x2015;<b><i>Dr. Dan Bahat, former District Archaeologist of Jerusalem</i></b><br><br>"Joe Amaral's insights into first century Jewish culture will be of great benefit for anyone who is looking to discover and understand the original meaning of Jesus' teachings.

The authors aim to meet these objectives by presenting a unique approach that is realistic, practical, applied, and user friendly. Unlike other textbooks on the market, <em>Program Evaluation for Social Workers</em> presents both program-level evaluation and case-level evaluation methods; assuming that neither of these two distinct approaches alone adequately reflects the realities of the field, the book demonstrates how they can instead complement each other. This integration of approaches provides an accessible, adaptable, and realistic framework for students and beginning practitioners to more easily grasp and implement in the real world.<br></p><p><br>Richard M.

Cole Latimer is a dashing Yankee surgeon who has served the Union faithfully, and his tender heart compels him to help a ragged, innocent "lad" in need--never suspecting the rags conceal a bewitching belle suspected of being a rebel spy.</p><p>But Alaina's masquerade does not fool Cole for long. And the strength, courage, and breathtaking sensuality of this woman whom it would be treasonous to love sets duty and desire at war within him. Yet Destiny has joined them for good or ill--and they both must follow where their hearts would lead them, if they are to build a glorious new life together out of the ashes of the old.</p></p><p><p>(1939 - 2007) Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, creator of the modern historical romance, died July 6, 2007 in Minnesota. She had just turned 68. Her attorney, William Messerlie, said that she died after a long illness.</p> <p>Born on June 3, 1939 in Alexandria, Louisiana, Mrs. Woodiwiss was the youngest of eight siblings. She long relished creating original narratives, and by age six was telling herself stories at night to help herself fall asleep. At age 16, she met U.S. Air Force Second Lieutenant Ross Woodiwiss at a dance, and they married the following year. She wrote her first book in longhand while living at a military outpost in Japan. </p> <p>Woodiwiss is credited with the invention of the modern historical romance novel: in 1972, she released <em>The Flame and the Flower</em>, an instant <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, creating literary precedent. The <em>Flame and the Flower</em> revolutionized mainstream publishing, featuring an epic historical romance with a strong heroine and impassioned sex scenes. "Kathleeen E. Woodiwiss is the founding mother of the historical romance genre," says Carrie Feron, vice president/editorial director of William Morrow and Avon Books, imprints of HarperCollins Publishers. Feron, who has been Woodiwiss's editor for 13 years, continues, "Avon Books is proud to have been Kathleen's sole publishing partner for her paperbacks and hardcover novels for more than three decades." Avon Books, a leader in the historical romance genre to this day, remains Mrs. Woodiwiss's original and only paperback publisher; William Morrow, Avon's sister company, publishes Mrs. Woodiwiss's hardcovers. </p><p><em>The Flame and the Flower</em> was rejected by agents and hardcover publishers, who deemed it as "too long" at 600 pages. Rather than follow the advice of the rejection letters and rewrite the novel, Mrs. Woodiwiss instead submitted it to paperback publishers. The first publisher on her list, Avon, quickly purchased the novel and arranged an initial 500,000 print run. The novel sold over 2.3 million copies in its first four years of publication.</p><p>The success of this novel prompted a new style of writing romance, concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between a helpless heroines and the hero who rescued her, even if he had been the one to place her in danger. The romance novels which followed in her example featured longer plots, more controversial situations and characters, and more intimate and steamy sex scenes.</p> <p>"Her words engendered an incredible passion among readers," notes Feron. Bestselling author Julia Quinn agrees, saying, "Woodiwiss made women want to read. She gave them an alternative to Westerns and hard-boiled police procedurals. When I was growing up, I saw my mother and grandmother reading and enjoying romances, and when I was old enough to read them myself, I felt as if I had been admitted into a special sisterhood of reading women." </p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Susan Elizabeth Phillips, a leading voice in the women's fiction arena, says, "We all owe our careers to her. She opened the world of romance to us as readers. She created a career for us to go into." </p> <p>The pioneering author has written 13 novels over the course of 35 years, all <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers. Kathleen E. Woodiwiss's final literary work, the upcoming <em>Everlasing</em>, will be published by William Morrow in October 2007. "<em>Everlasting</em> is Kathleen's final gift to her fans," notes Feron. </p> <p>Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, who was predeceased by her husband and son Dorren, is survived by sons Sean and Heath, and numerous grandchildren.</p>Intrepid young Alaina already knows the handsome Yankee captain, but in her disguise as a boy, she cannot allow her womanly reaction to the virile army surgeon to betray her. But one tempestuous night Cole finds himself in a Southern plantation, with a beautiful woman he does not recognize, and Alaina's defenses are bombarded in ways she had never thought possible. <p>Bright moonlight streamed in through the parted curtains, lightening the room until all was visible. Though the lingering essence of intoxicants still clouded his brain, Cole became aware of the woman who leaned against the door. His mind felt slow and listless, and he could find no reason for what he saw, nor could he explain his presence in a strange bedroom. His situation struck him as extremely precarious. For all he knew he might momentarily find himself confronted by an outraged husband or an irate father bent on restoring his daughter's honor.</p><p> "Ma'am," he began, sorely chafed at the thickness of his tongue. "I fear I have intruded." </p><p> Alaina realized escape was impossible, and knew she would have to brazen it out.</p><p>Her soft laughter broke the silence of the room. "Surely you haven't decided to leave us after you vowed to stay the night, Captain. Can it be that you have forgotten so soon?" She mimicked the relaxed familiarity of the most successful courtesan and her voice was as honey, smooth and cultured. The deception seemed simple enough; she could play this part as successfully as that of ragged urchin. Yet she was thankful for the shadow that shrouded Cole's nakedness, for the game might have dissolved in her own embarrassment and flight. </p><p> Alaina remembered her uncle had kept a decanter of brandy hidden away in the guest room, and she went to search the bureau for it. This was no time for the captain to sober up. If he would just drink enough and go back to bed, she was sure he would sleep the night through.</p><p> As she passed before the window, a shaft of silvery moonlight penetrated her garments. The slim but well-curved figure whet Cole's appetite and imagination no small amount. The lust flared through his starved senses, and he felt a familiar tightening in his loins.</p><p> "Here, Captain," the silky voice urged as the woman came back. "Have another drink." Alaina pressed a water glass, liberally filled with brandy, into his hand, then slipped quickly away as he reached for her. Her soft laughter teased him. "Drink first, Captain." </p><p> Cole lifted the glass and tasted deeply of its contents. He was rather pleased at its quality but accepted that too as logical. In the captive city, brothels were the only establishments that continued to operate affluently, and it was evident that this one was a step above the others he had seen.</p><p> "Now really, Captain." She rested a hand on his furred chest and pushed him back lightly. "You should return to bed. There's a chill in the air, and you'll surely catch your death." Cole tried to focus on her face, but it was only a vague blur. "I've an errand to do downstairs, but it won't take long, then I'll be back."</p><p> The idea was not to Cole's liking. He finished the brandy in an impatient gulp, hardly feeling its warmth with the heat that already throbbed through his veins, and set the glass aside.</p><p> "You rest yourself a moment, Captain," Alaina coaxed softly, moving away. "I really must be about my errand."</p><p> Cole cursed his stumbling gait but caught her arm as she reached the door. Alaina looked up at him in surprise, not daring to speak. Her heart pounded turbulently within her bosom. He seemed so tall and immense as he loomed over her like a threatening dark avenger.</p><p> "A kiss I would have," he murmured thickly, "lest I grow weary of the wait. Come." He pulled her hard against his chest. "Give me a sampling of your wares that I might better anticipate your return." </p><p> She found her lips entrapped with his, and though they were soft and gentle, they flamed with a fiery heat that warmed her whole body. Her eyes closed and the strength of his embrace, the brandy taste of his mouth, the hard pressure of his loins made her all too aware that this was a strong, living, healthy man, that he was treating her like a woman, indeed desiring her. Her head swam as he drew back slightly, and she wondered vaguely if she might swoon. In the quiet moment that passed between them, she tried to still the violent tremor that had seized her.</p></p><h2>The Penguin Book of the Undead: Fifteen Hundred Years of Supernatural Encounters (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The walking dead from 15 centuries haunt this compendium of ghostly visitations through the ages, exploring the history of our fascination with zombies and other restless souls.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Since ancient times, accounts of supernatural activity have mystified us. Ghost stories as we know them did not develop until the late nineteenth century, but the restless dead haunted the premodern imagination in many forms, as recorded in historical narratives, theological texts, and personal letters. <i>The Penguin Book of the Undead</i> teems with roving hordes of dead warriors, corpses trailed by packs of barking dogs, moaning phantoms haunting deserted ruins, evil spirits emerging from burning carcasses in the form of crows, and zombies with pestilential breath. Spanning from the Hebrew scriptures to the Roman Empire, the Scandinavian sagas to medieval Europe, the Protestant Reformation to the Renaissance, this beguiling array of accounts charts our relationship with spirits and apparitions, wraiths and demons over fifteen hundred years, showing the evolution in our thinking about the ability of dead souls to return to the realm of the living&#x2014;and to warn us about what awaits us in the afterlife.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

In the late 1960s, at age sixty, she left her husband after thirty-eight years of marriage. One night, she packed a single suitcase and returned alone to New York City, moving intoa studio apartment in Greenwich Village near her family. In her new home, Sara began discovering new things and establishing new rituals, from watching Jeopardy each night at 7:00 to eating pizza at the Museum of Modern Art&#x2019;s cafeteria every Wednesday. She also began discarding the unnecessary, according to the Kalmans: "in a burst of personal expression, she decided to wear only white." </p><p>Sara kept her belongings in an extraordinarily clean and organized closet. Filled with elegant, minimalist, heavily starched, impeccably pressed and folded all-white clothing, including socks and undergarments, as well as carefully selected objects&#x2014;from a potato grater to her signature perfume, Chanel No.19&#x2014;the space was sublime. Upon her death in 2004, her family decided to preserve its pristine contents, hoping to find a way to exhibit them one day.</p><p>In 2015, the Mmuseumm, a new type of museum located in a series of unexpected locations founded and curated by Sara&#x2019;s grandson, Alex Kalman, recreated the space in a popular exhibit&#x2014;Sara Berman's Closet&#x2014;in Tribeca. The installation eventually moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The show will run at the Skirball Center in Los Angeles from December 4, 2018 to March 10, 2019; it will open again about a month later at the National Museum of American Jewish History from April 5, 2019 to September 1, 2019.</p><p>Inspired by the exhibit, this spectacular illustrated memoir, packed with family photographs, exclusive images, and Maira Kalman's distinctive paintings, is an ode to Sara&#x2019;s life, freedom, and re-invention. <em>Sara Berman&#x2019;s Clos</em>et is an indelible portrait of the human experience&#x2014;overcoming hardship, taking risks, experiencing joy, enduring loss. It is also a reminder of the significance of the seemingly insignificant moments in our lives&#x2014;the moments we take for granted that may turn out to be the sweetest. Filled with a daughter and grandson&#x2019;s wry and touching observations conveyed in Maira&#x2019;s signature script, <em>Sara Berman&#x2019;s Closest</em> is a beautiful, loving tribute to one woman&#x2019;s indomitable spirit.</p></p><p><p>This is a book about Sara and her Journey to America and eating lemon ices and the meaning of time. A small andmonumental story.</p><p>Maira Kalman is the illustrator of <em>The Elements of Style</em> by William Strunk Jr, the author of <em>My Favorite Things, Principles of Uncertainty,</em> and the bestselling <em>And the Pursuit of Happiness,</em> and the author/illustrator of numerous children's books.

Then he turned to look at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said. I leaned down to pick up the few bits of catnip that had fallen out of the mangled cat toy. Owen had a thing for catnip in general, and neon-yellow chickens stuffed with it in particular, and I had friends who bought them for him just about as fast as he could chew them apart.</p><p>I dumped the bits of dried catnip in the garbage and reached for my shoes on the mat near the back door.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrr?&#x201d; Owen said.</p><p>&#x201c;I have a meeting at the library.&#x201d;</p><p>He immediately raised his paw and took a couple of passes at his face with it. Then he crossed to sit in front of the kitchen door.</p><p>I knew what that meant. &#x201c;No, you can&#x2019;t come with me,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder at me. &#x201c;Mrr,&#x201d; he said again.</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t come. Cats don&#x2019;t belong at the library.&#x201d; They didn&#x2019;t belong at the library, but both of mine had ended up there more than once. &#x201c;Just because I&#x2019;m the head librarian doesn&#x2019;t mean that you and your brother get special privileges.&#x201d;</p><p>Owen narrowed his golden eyes. His whiskers twitched, and then he disappeared.</p><p>Literally. It was his superpower, so to speak, the way the Flash could run faster than anyone else on the planet, although I was pretty sure Owen hadn&#x2019;t gotten his ability due to the explosion of a particle accelerator during a thunderstorm.</p><p>I&#x2019;d gotten very blas� about Owen&#x2019;s ability to just vanish whenever he wanted to. I remembered how it had made me think I was losing my mind the first few times I&#x2019;d seen it happen, and then the stomach-churning fear I&#x2019;d felt when I realized what could happen to him and his brother, Hercules, if anyone had found out about my cats&#x2019; unbelievable abilities. Hercules couldn&#x2019;t become invisible at will; he could walk through walls. Both cats also had a seemingly uncanny ability to understand what was said to them. And now, to make things ten times more complicated, I was almost positive that Marcus&#x2019;s little ginger tabby, Micah, had the same vanishing skill as Owen.</p><p>My Marcus. Detective Marcus Gordon, who only believed in the facts, in things he could see and touch. If I was right about Micah there was a lot I&#x2019;d need to explain. Not that I had any explanation. All three cats came from the old Henderson estate, Wisteria Hill. That had to have something to do with their abilities. I just had no idea what.</p><p>I&#x2019;d sold my car when I&#x2019;d moved to Mayville Heights from Boston two and a half years ago to supervise the renovations at the library. I spent my first few weeks in town exploring, walking for miles, which is how I&#x2019;d stumbled on Wisteria Hill. At the time the property was abandoned. Now my friend Roma owned it, and the old farmhouse was full of life again. Back then it had seemed lonely and forgotten.</p><p>Owen and Hercules had peeked at me from a tangle of raspberry canes, two tiny balls of fur, and then trailed me while I explored the overgrown English country garden behind the old house. When I left, they&#x2019;d followed me down the rutted gravel driveway. Twice I&#x2019;d picked them up and carried them back to the empty house, but they were undeterred. They were so tiny and so determined to come with me that in the end I&#x2019;d given up and brought them home. They were affectionate with me, but I&#x2019;d quickly learned that because they had been feral they didn&#x2019;t tolerate anyone else touching them.</p><p>I stepped into my red Keds and bent down to tie the laces. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wasting your time,&#x201d; I said in the general direction of the last place I&#x2019;d seen Owen. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go with me in the truck because I&#x2019;m going to walk.&#x201d;</p><p>I counted silently to three and he appeared again.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to a meeting. You&#x2019;d be bored.&#x201d;</p><p>Owen made grumbling noises in the back of his throat and turned his head, pointedly looking away from me.</p><p>&#x201c;I think you left a Funky Chicken in my closet,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>One gray ear twitched but he still didn&#x2019;t look at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Look in my black pumps.&#x201d;</p><p>Owen shook himself and started across the kitchen floor. &#x201c;Mrr,&#x201d; he said softly when he got to the living room doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;You have a good day, too,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>It was a gorgeous morning as I started down Mountain Road. The sun was high in the sky over Lake Pepin and it was already warmer than the typical high for a day in early November.</p><p>It had been a while since I&#x2019;d walked to the library. It was something I used to do every day. When I&#x2019;d discovered everything I wanted to do was within walking distance, I hadn&#x2019;t bought a car. Eventually, Harrison Taylor had gifted me with a truck that could make it through even the worst Minnesota snow, a thank-you because I&#x2019;d discovered some papers that had helped him find his daughter. Harrison&#x2019;s son, Harry Junior, took care of the yard work at my small house. The old man and I had met when he&#x2019;d accompanied his son one day. I&#x2019;d stepped into my backyard and for a moment thought Santa Claus was sitting on one of my Adirondack chairs. Harrison and I had quickly become good friends.</p><p>Mountain Road curves in toward the center of town, so as I headed down the hill the roof of the library building came into view. The library sits just about at the midpoint of a curve of shoreline, protected from the water by a rock wall. The two-story brick building has an original stained-glass window at one end and a copper-roofed cupola, complete with the restored wrought-iron weather vane that had been placed on the roof when the library had been completed more than a hundred years ago.</p><p>The Mayville Heights Free Public Library is a Carnegie library, built in 1912 with money donated by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. I&#x2019;d originally come to town to supervise the restoration of the building for its centenary, as well as update the collections and set up Internet access for the library&#x2019;s patrons. Very quickly the town and its people began to feel like home and when I&#x2019;d been offered the chance to stay I&#x2019;d said yes.</p><p>At the bottom of the hill I waited for two cars to pass and then crossed over to the same side of the street as the library. My friend Maggie, who was an artist, had created a collage map of the hiking trails in the area for the new Tourism Coalition that would be ready to hand out in the spring. Now Everett Henderson had her working on some ideas for a similar map of Mayville Heights. Everett had financed the repairs to the library as a gift to the town. The self-made businessman knew how to get things done and I felt confident that we&#x2019;d have a town map by spring.</p><p>Ella King drove past me, waving when she caught sight of me. I waved back. I was guessing that she had just dropped her husband, Keith, at the library for the same meeting I was headed to.</p><p>Several weeks previous, a crew working on renovations to the main post office had torn down a wall and discovered a small cache of photos and undelivered mail. No one had any idea how it had all ended up there. Based on the postmarks, the mail had been behind the wall a bit more than twenty years. Some of the photos were of the same vintage, others were much older. The letters and cards had all been delivered, but no one was quite sure what to do with the photos, and before I knew what was happening the library board had offered to take them. Several days later a small cardboard box had been delivered to the library.</p><p>Mary Lowe and I had opened the box at the front desk and looked through the photos. Mary was my most senior employee. I&#x2019;d hoped she might recognize some of the people in the pictures. In the end she&#x2019;d taken seven photos to give to, if not their original owners, at least to family who&#x2019;d probably be happy to have them.</p><p>As far as the post office was concerned the photos were now the property of the library. I hated the thought of them sitting in a box on a shelf in our workroom. What I wanted to do was reunite the pictures with the people in them or at least a family member. I thought of how much fun my sister and brother and I had gotten from looking at old photos a friend of our parents had unearthed from early in their acting careers. I knew there had to be people who would treasure these images if I could just find them. That&#x2019;s what this meeting was about.</p><p>Maggie was coming because I knew whatever we ended up doing would benefit from her artistic eye. Rebecca Henderson and Keith King were on the library board. Rebecca was a long-time member, while Keith was the newest addition, and I felt both of them would have some good suggestions. I&#x2019;d also asked Sandra Godfrey, who was a mail carrier now but who had worked in the main post office at one time, to join us.</p><p>It looked like I was right about Ella having dropped off Keith. He was standing on the walkway in front of the building, talking to Abigail Pierce, another of my staff members. She was wearing a chocolate-brown coat sweater she&#x2019;d knit herself, which went well with her red hair streaked with gray. Abigail was also an author and I was hearing lots of great buzz about her new children&#x2019;s book.</p><p>Keith caught sight of me and smiled. He was about average height, wiry and strong with dark hair and a pair of black-and-stainless-steel-framed glasses. The glasses were new in the last month. &#x201c;Hey, Kathleen,&#x201d; he said, nudging one corner of the frames.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; I said. I pulled my keys out of my pocket and started up the library steps. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you come wait inside?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sure?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;You can have a cup of coffee before the meeting starts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say no to that.&#x201d; He grinned.</p><p>I unlocked the doors, shut off the alarm system and we stepped inside.</p><p>Abigail had switched on the main floor lights. She started for the stairs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put the coffee on,&#x201d; she said over her shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;You mind if I take a look at the magazines?&#x201d; Keith asked.</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;Go ahead. I&#x2019;ll let you know when the coffee&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;</p><p>I went upstairs and dropped my things in my office. It only took five minutes to get set up for the meeting since I&#x2019;d gotten the room ready before I&#x2019;d left the previous day.</p><p>&#x201c;Napkins,&#x201d; Abigail said, poking her head around the doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said, taking them from her. I looked around the room. There were enough chairs around the long table, I&#x2019;d brought down a whiteboard and there was a carafe of coffee along with another of hot water for tea.</p><p>Maggie arrived about five minutes after we opened. I was at the circulation desk sorting the books from the book drop when she walked in. She smiled when she saw me and walked across the mosaic tile floor to join me.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning. Is this really November?&#x201d; she asked, unzipping her jacket. &#x201c;I think it was colder in September than it is today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;According to the forecast we could hit close to seventy this afternoon,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Global warming or something else?&#x201d; Maggie cocked her head to one side and eyed me. &#x201c;I know you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A weak La Ni�a that developed in October,&#x201d; I said, feeling a little like that kid back in elementary school who had liked to read the encyclopedia for fun&#x2014;which was exactly the kind of kid I had actually been.</p><p>Maggie grinned, playing with the fringe of the multi-colored scarf she&#x2019;d wrapped twice around her neck. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re better than Google!&#x201d;</p><p>I grinned back at her. &#x201c;And I work even when there&#x2019;s no Wi-Fi!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Am I the first one here?&#x201d; She looked around the main floor of the library.</p><p>&#x201c;Keith&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; I said, gesturing in the direction of the meeting room.</p><p>Just then Harry Taylor walked into the building. He looked around and when he saw us raised a hand to get my attention and headed over.</p><p>&#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; he said, nodding at both of us.</p><p>Harry was in his late fifties. There were deep lines carved around his green eyes from years of working in the sun, and the fringe of salt-and-pepper hair peeking out from under his Twins baseball cap was pretty much the only hair he had left. He was a quiet, thoughtful man, and very well read, I knew.</p><p>&#x201c;I was hoping I&#x2019;d catch you before it got busy, Kathleen,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve pretty much done all I can do on those shelves in the workshop. Next step is to get them put together here.&#x201d;</p><p>Harry was building a shelving unit to fit on one wall of our upstairs workroom. I was hoping that would help us finally get the space organized.</p><p>&#x201c;I can get everything moved out of the way this afternoon,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You can get started tomorrow if you want to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds good,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll be back this afternoon to fix the broken seat in the gazebo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re putting shelves in the workroom?&#x201d; Maggie asked.</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;On the end wall that&#x2019;s common with my office. And not just shelves. Harry is making a cupboard we can lock with a drawer underneath. That whole wall will be storage.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie turned to Harry. &#x201c;Could you do something like that for me at my studio? I need a better way to organize supplies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you have in mind?&#x201d; he asked, pulling a small notebook and a pencil out of the pocket of his green quilted vest.</p><p>Maggie looked at me. &#x201c;Do I have time to talk to Harry?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;Go ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>They started toward a nearby cluster of tables, Maggie&#x2019;s hands moving through the air as she talked.</p><p>I set the pile of books by my elbow on a cart as Susan came from the computer area, where she&#x2019;d just booted up all of our public-access computers for the day.</p><p>&#x201c;I have about half of the books from the book drop sorted,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost time for the meeting to get started, so I&#x2019;m just going to run up to my office for a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll finish the this,&#x201d; she said, sliding into the chair behind the counter and reaching for the handle at the side to raise the seat.</p><p>Susan was tiny, barely five feet tall in her sock feet.

With a clarity that will appeal to any reader, Thomas Bokenkotter divides his study into five parts that correspond to the major historical and epochal developments in Catholicism. His authoritative, thorough approach takes readers from the Church&#x2019;s triumph over paganism, through "the sound and fury of renewal," to a new section devoted to such topics as dissent and current developments in the ecumenical movement. Informative illustrations throughout the book, new to this edition, enrich the reader's experience, and the addition of a wide-ranging bibliography increases its value as a sourcebook.</p><p>This critically acclaimed history covers the events and doctrines that have shaped Catholic thought and action over the past two millennia.

From artists and writers to statesmen of the world - view her world from the splendors of the courts of St. Petersburg and Vienna to the cold and desolate winter in France of 1940&#39;s. Here is a very candid and revealing personal story coupled with a unique insider&#39;s view of aristocracy&#39;s golden age.</p><p>Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan (1877-1964) was a member of the prominent American Vanderbilt family. She became the Duchess of Marlborough on her marriage to the ninth Duke of Marlborough in 1895.Glitter and the Gold, The <br> <i>1</i> <i>The World of My Youth</i> IN TRYING to recount events that have influenced my life, it is humiliating to find that I remember very little of my childhood. Watching my great-grandchild Serena Russell at play, so sure of herself, even at the age of three, I wonder if, when she reaches my age, she also will have forgotten events that now appear important to her. That we are both in America - she the child of my granddaughter Sarah Spencer-Churchill, who married an American, and I the wife of a Frenchman - is due to World War II, and to events little anticipated at the turn of the century when I left my native land. Memories of myself at Serena's age recall a picture painted by Carolus Duran of a little girl against a tall red curtain. She is wearing a red velvet dress with a square <i>d�collet�</i> outlined with Venetian lace. A cloud of dark hair surrounds a small oval face, out of which enormous dark eyes (much bigger than they were) look out from under arched brows. A pert little nose and dimples accentuate the mischievous smile. There is something vital and disturbing in that small figure tightly grasping a bunch of roses in each fist. 'You were <i>un vrai petit diable</i>, and only kept still when I played the organ in my studio!' Carolus Duran exclaimed, when again he painted me, this time at seventeen. The second portrait was a very different affair from the first, for the red curtain which had become his traditional background was at my mother's request replaced by a classic landscape in the English eighteenth-century style, and I am seen a tall figure in white descending a flight of steps. For my mother, having decided, in the fashion not uncommon at the time, to marry me either to the man who did become my husband or to his cousin- generously allowing me the choice of alternatives - wished my portrait to bear comparison with those of preceding duchesses who had been painted by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Romney and Lawrence. In that proud and lovely line I still stand over the mantelpiece of one of the state-rooms at Blenheim Palace, with a slightly disdainful and remote look as if very far away in thought. It is well that my Aunt Florence Twombly, now ninety-eight, could remember not only the street but also the number of the house where I was born, for my birth had never been officially recorded. This information was required when I took back my American citizenship after the French armistice in World War II. It was in one of those ugly brownstone houses somewhere in the forties, which was then the fashionable district of New York, that I first saw the light of day. My father's family was Dutch and had its origin in the Bilt - that northern point of Holland whence comes our name. It was about the year 1650 that the first member of the family came to the New Netherlands, and succeeding generations lived in the vicinity of New Amsterdam, as New York City was then called. In the first part of the nineteenth century my great-grandfather Cornelius Vanderbilt founded the family fortune, moved from New Dorp, Staten Island, to New York and changed the spelling of our name from van der Bilt to its American version. In later years I met a Professor van der Bilt who taught at a Dutch University. He told me that there was only one family bearing our name in Holland, and in looking through his family archives he had become convinced that the Dutch and American branches had descended from a common ancestor. In the <i>Patriciat</i>, a book that is the Dutch equivalent of the <i>British Landed Gentry</i>, the Professor pointed out our coat of arms, the three acorns, and the names Gertrude, Cornelius and William, which repeatedly figure in our family Bible. My grandfather, William H. Vanderbilt, had, considering his numerous philanthropic gifts, an unmerited reputation for indifference to the welfare of others. It was, as is often the case, founded on a remark shorn of its context. This is the version of the 'public be damned' story that was given me by a friend of the family. Mr.Vanderbilt was on a business trip and, after a long and arduous day, had gone to his private car for a rest. A swarm of reporters arrived asking to come on board for an interview. Mr. Vanderbilt sent word he was tired and did not wish to give an interview, but would receive one representative of the Press for a few minutes. A young man arrived saying, 'Mr. Vanderbilt, <i>your</i> public <i>demands</i> an interview!' This made Mr. Vanderbilt laugh, and he answered, 'Oh, <i>my</i> public be damned.' In due course the young man left and next morning his article appeared in the paper with a large headline reading, 'Vanderbilt says, "The Public be damned." ' That he was not so black as painted I have from a cousin to whom my grandmother after her husband's death said, 'Your grandfather never said an unkind word to me during all the years we were married.' In 'The House of Vanderbilt'1 by Frank Crowninshield, I find a reference to my grandmother in which he says, 'She was an amazing woman who brought up her children to become people of the greatest cultivation and taste. She had been born Maria Louisa Kissam, the daughter of a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church. The Kissams were an old and distinguished family, Mrs. Vanderbilt's father having descended from the Benjamin Kissam who, in 1786, married Cornelia Roosevelt, the daughter of the patriarchal Isaac, and the President's great-great-grandfather.' Of my grandmother's eight children my father, W. K., as he was known to his friends, was the second son. I remember my grandmother very well, and our visits to her in the big house on Fifth Avenue directly opposite St. Patrick's Cathedral where she lived. She was a lovely old lady, gracious and sweet as old ladies should be. All her grandchildren - we were, I think, twenty-six - loved her. After my grandfather's death in 1885 she lived alone with her youngest son, George. Uncle George was quite different from my other uncles and aunts. With his dark hair and eyes, he might have been a Spaniard. He had a narrow sensitive face, and artistic and literary tastes. After my grandmother's death in 1896 he createdBiltmore, a great estate in North Carolina where he built model houses and fostered village industries. My father's eldest brother Uncle Corneil, as we called him, was a stern and serious person, or so we thought. He was not gay like my father and Uncle Fred. Of my four aunts I loved my Aunt Emily Sloane best, for, like my father, she was of a joyous nature and had the look of happy expectancy one sees on the faces of those who love life. She and my Aunt Florence were always perfectly dressed, and, with their slight figures and quiet distinction, reminded me of Jane Austen's charmingly prim ladies. Some time before her death I went to see Aunt Emily. She was sitting at a window overlooking Central Park. It struck me that her days must have been very long, now that she was widowed and that the bridge game she loved was no longer possible because of her failing memory. But when I sympathised with her, she folded her hands and softly smiling answered - 'I have such lovely thoughts to keep me company,' and when I crept away, fearing to disturb them, I heard her murmuring, as if conversing with ghosts of the past. She lived to be over ninety. At her memorial service the Rector of St. Bartholomew's in New York paid a well-deserved tribute to her lovely character and generous charity. My maternal grandfather, Murray Forbes Smith, was descended from the Stirlings, and both my mother's given names - Alva Erskine - are Stirling names. The Scotch tradition of large families is borne out in two volumes on the Stirlings in America. This prolific family overflowed from Virginia into the more southern states and produced several governors and people of importance. All this accentuated in my mother a pride in her Southern birth and a certain disdain for the mercenary spirit of the North. Her father, who owned plantations near Mobile, was ruined by the liberation of the slaves and, after the Civil War, moved to Paris. There my mother's eldest sister made her d�but at one of the last balls given at the Tuileries by Napoleon III. My mother and I used to attribute our love for France to a Huguenot ancestor who escaped to America after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Indeed we were happier in France than in any other country, and, following the example of an aunt and a great-aunt, we both returned to live there. Why my parents ever married remains a mystery to me. They were both delightful, charming and intelligent people, but wholly unsuited to each other. My father, although deep in his business interests, found life a happy adventure. His gentle nature hated strife. I still feel pain at the thought of the unkind messages I was made the bearer of when, in the months that preceded their parting, my mother no longer spoke to him. The purport of those messages I no longer remember - they were, I believe, concerned with the divorce she desired and with her wishes and decrees regarding custody of the children and arrangements for the future. My father had a generous and unselfish nature; his pleasure was to see people happy and he enjoyed the company of his children and friends, but my mother - for reasons I can but ascribe to a towering ambition - opposed these carefree views with all the force of her strong personality. Her combative nature rejoiced in conquests. She loved a fight. A born dictator, she dominated events about her as thoroughly as she eventually dominated her husband and her children. If she admitted another point of view she never conceded it; we were pawns in her game to be moved as her wishes decreed. I remember once objecting to her taste in the clothes she selected for me. With a harshness hardly warranted by so innocent an observation, she informed me that I had no taste and that my opinions were not worth listening to. She brooked no contradiction, and when once I replied, 'I thought I was doing right,' she stated, 'I don't ask <i>you</i> to think, <i>I</i> do the thinking, you do as you are told,' which reduced me to imbecility. Her dynamic energy and her quick mind, together with her varied interests, made her a delightful companion. But the bane of her life and of those who shared it was a violent temper that, like a tempest, at times engulfed us all. One of her earliest ambitions was to become a leader of New York society. To this end she gave a fancy dress ball for the opening of her new house, 660 Fifth Avenue, on March 26, 1883. In contemporary newspapers I have read how eagerly invitations to this party were sought after. It proved to be, they said, the most magnificent entertainment yet given in a private house in America. My parents, gorgeous in medieval costumes, received the <i>�lite</i> of what then was New York society. My godmother, who as Consuelo Yznaga had been my mother's bridesmaid, was our house guest and the ball was given in her honour. She was then Viscountess Mandeville and soon after, when her husband succeeded to the dukedom, became Duchess of Manchester. Beautiful, witty, gay and gifted, with the ability to play by ear any melody she had heard, she delighted us with her charm. Her lovely twin daughters who died so tragically young and her son Kimbolton spent that winter with us. Kim had early acquired the sense of importance a title is apt to confer, and one day when the postman left a letter for Viscount Mandeville with the comment, 'How I would like to see a real live lord,' he was astonished to see a diminutive figure in a sailor suit approach him exclaiming, 'Then look at me.' Now firmly established as a social leader, my mother, wishing still further to dominate her world, assumed the prerogatives of an <i>arbiter elegantiarum</i>, instructing her contemporaries both in the fine arts and the art of living. Ransacking the antique shops of Europe, she returned with pictures and furniture to adorn the mansions it became her passion to build. She thus set a fashion for period houses, which at that date were little known in the United States. Once she was successfully installed in the three homes she had built, her restless energy must, I imagine, have turned to other projects. It was perhaps then that plans for my future were born. Courage was one of her prominent characteristics - a courage that was physical as well as spiritual. I shall never forget an incident when I had occasion to realise how intrepid and quick were her reactions. It took place at Idlehour, our home on Long Island. One day when I, aged nine, was out driving, my pony started to run away with me, making straight for a water hydrant. My cart would undoubtedly have been overturned; but without the slightest hesitation my mother, who was standing near-by, threw herself between the hydrant and the racing pony and seized his bridle, thus preventing a serious accident. Reminiscences relating to one's childhood are apt to be tinged with a self-conscious pity, which in my generation might be considered justified, for we were the last to be subjected to a harshparental discipline. In my youth, children were to be seen but not heard; implicit obedience was an obligation from which one could not conscientiously escape. Indeed, we suffered a severe and rigorous upbringing. Corporal punishment for minor delinquencies was frequently administered with a riding-whip. I have a vivid memory of the last such lashing my legs received as I stood while my mother wielded her crop. Being the elder, I had the privilege of the first taste of the whip - Willie followed. We had, my brother and I, been sailing in our boat on a pond. Our governess, Fraulein Wedekind, wished to bring us home, but, lost in the pleasure of the sport, we paid no attention to her calls. At length, as we neared the bank, she caught us and, imprudently straddling the water with one leg on shore, she tried to stop us. Alas, how could one prevent the wicked impulse to give a sudden shove with an oar, setting the boat free and seating Fraulein in the water? It seemed very funny at the time, but as we neared home, our governess trailing her wet skirts straight up to our mother, the incident lost its charm. I bore these punishments stoically, but such repressive measures bred inhibitions and even now I can trace their effects. It is a melancholy fact that childhood, so short when compared with the average span of life, should exert such a strong and permanent influence on character that no amount of self-training afterwards can ever completely counter it. How different is the child's education today! Prejudiced as I am by my own experience, I still think that, although my mother's standard was too severe, it was preferable to the complete lack of discipline I see in many homes today. Punishments, which were private affairs, were more easily borne than ridicule suffered in public. I remember an occasion when, dressed in a period costume designed by my mother - for it was her wish that I should stand out from others, hallmarked like precious silver - I suffered the agonies of shame that the ridicule of adults can cause children. Then again I was particularly sensitive about my nose, for it had an upward curve which my mother and her friends discussed with complete disregard for my feelings. Since nothing could be done to guide its misguided progress, there seemed to be no point in stressing my misfortune. I developed an inferioritycomplex and became conscious not only of physical defects but also of faults that with gentler treatment might have been less painfully corrected. Introspection and heart-searching caused hypersensitiveness and a quick temper to cloud an otherwise amiable disposition. My brother Willie was my junior by eighteen months. He had inherited my ...</p><h2>How You Can Be Led by the Spirit of God</h2><p>Step by step guidance through the Scriptures to steer Christians away from spiritual pitfalls and help them to follow the Spirit of God in every area of life.

In the words of one contemporary, it divided the world "into two different Parties, Pamelists and Anti-pamelists," even eclipsing the sensational factional politics of the day. Preached for its morality, and denounced as pornography in disguise, it vividly describes a young servant's long resistance to the attempts of her predatory master to seduce her. Written in the voice of its low-born heroine, Pamela is not only a work of pioneering psychological complexity, but also a compelling and provocative study of power and its abuse.<br> Based on the original text of 1740, from which Richardson later retreated in a series of defensive revisions, this edition makes available the version of Pamela that aroused such widespread controversy on its first appearance.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

If anything, email and the Internet may have intensified our quest for the quick fix. But Peterson's time-tested prescription for discipleship remains the same--a long obedience in the same direction. Tucked away in the Hebrew Psalter, Peterson discovered "an old dog-eared songbook," the Songs of Ascents that were sung by pilgrims on their way up to worship in Jerusalem. In these songs (Psalms 120-134) Peterson finds encouragement for modern pilgrims as we learn to grow in worship, service, joy, work, happiness, humility, community and blessing. This 20th anniversary edition of <em>A Long Obedience in the Same Direction</em> features these Psalms in Peterson's widely acclaimed paraphrase, <em>The Message.</em> He also includes an epilogue in which he reflects on the themes of this book and his ministry during the twenty years since its original publication.</p><p>Eugene H.

Peterson was founding pastor of Christ Our King Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, Maryland, where he served for twenty-nine years before retiring in 1991. With degrees from Seattle Pacific, New York Theological Seminary, and Johns Hopkins University, he served as professor of spiritual theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, until retiring in 2006."There is a clean, bright rigor to honest life before God. Burnishing the language of the Psalms, Eugene Peterson makes that life sing like a taut wire. A Long Obedience is the only path of discipleship to Jesus, and this is a message we desperately need to hear and implement today." -- <i>Dallas Willard, author of The Divine Conspiracy</i></p><h2>The Body Artist: A Novel</h2><p>For thirty years, since the publication of his first novel Americana, Don DeLillo has lived in the skin of our times. He has found a voice for the forgotten souls who haunt the fringes of our culture and for its larger-than-life, real-life. figures. His language is defiantly, radiantly American.<br>Now, to a new century, he has brought The Body Artist. In this novel, he inhabits the muted world of Lauren Hartke, an artist whose work defies the limits of the body. Lauren is living on a lonely coast, in a rambling rented house, where she encounters a strange, ageless man, a man with uncanny knowledge of her own life. Together they begin a journey into the wilderness of time - time, love and human perception.</p><p>Don DeLillo's reputation rests on a series of large-canvas novels, in which he's proven to be the foremost diagnostician of our national psyche. In <i>The Body Artist</i>, however, he sacrifices breadth for depth, narrowing his focus to a single life, a single death. The protagonist is Lauren Hartke, who we see sharing breakfast with her husband, Rey, in the opening pages. This 18-page sequence is a tour de force (albeit a less showy one than the author's initial salvo in <i>Underworld</i>)--an intricate, funny notation of Lauren's consciousness as she pours cereal, peers out the window, and makes idle chat. Rey, alas, will proceed directly from the breakfast table to the home of his former wife, where he'll unceremoniously blow his brains out.<p> What follows is one of the strangest ghost stories since <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>. And like James's tale, it seems to partake of at least seven kinds of ambiguity, leaving the reader to sort out its riddles. Returning to their summer rental after Rey's funeral, Lauren discovers a strange stowaway living in a spare room: an inarticulate young man, perhaps retarded, who may have been there for weeks. His very presence is hard for her to pin down: "There was something elusive in his aspect, moment to moment, a thinning of physical address." Yet soon this mysterious figure begins to speak in Rey's voice, and her own, playing back entire conversations from the days preceding the suicide. Has Lauren's husband been reincarnated? Or is the man simply an eavesdropping idiot savant, reproducing sentences he'd heard earlier from his concealment?</p><p> DeLillo refuses any definitive answer. Instead he lets Lauren steep in her grief and growing puzzlement, and speculates in his own voice about this apparent intersection of past and present, life and death. At times his rhetoric gets away from him, an odd thing for such a superbly controlled writer. "How could such a surplus of vulnerability find itself alone in the world?" he asks, sounding as though he's discussing a sick puppy. And Lauren's performances--for she is the body artist of the title--sound pretty awful, the kind of thing Artaud might have cooked up for an aerobics class. Still, when DeLillo reins in the abstractions and bears down, the results are heartbreaking: </p><blockquote> Why shouldn't the death of a person you love bring you into lurid ruin? You don't know how to love the ones you love until they disappear abruptly. Then you understand how thinly distanced from their suffering, how sparing of self you often were, only rarely unguarded of heart, working your networks of give-and-take. </blockquote> At this stage of his career, a thin book is an adventure for DeLillo. So is his willingness to risk sentimentality, to immerse us in personal rather than national traumas. For all its flaws, then, <i>The Body Artist</i> is a real, raw accomplishment, and a reminder that bigger, even for so capacious an imagination as DeLillo's, isn't <i>always</i> better. <i>--James Marcus</i>This is <b>Don DeLillo's</b> twelfth novel.

Wilson) and named a best book by <i>Popular Science</i>, a dive into the secret lives of whales, from their four-legged past to their perilous present. </b><br>Whales are among the largest, most intelligent, deepest diving species to have ever lived on our planet. They evolved from land-roaming, dog-sized creatures into animals that move like fish, breathe like us, can grow to 300,000 pounds, live 200 years and travel entire ocean basins. Whales fill us with terror, awe, and affection--yet there is still so much we don't know about them. Why did it take whales over 50 million years to evolve to such big sizes, and how do they eat enough to stay that big? How did their ancestors return from land to the sea--and what can their lives tell us about evolution as a whole? Importantly, in the sweepstakes of human-driven habitat and climate change, will whales survive?<br><br>Nick Pyenson's research has given us the answers to some of our biggest questions about whales. He takes us deep inside the Smithsonian's unparalleled fossil collections, to frigid Antarctic waters, and to the arid desert in Chile, where scientists race against time to document the largest fossil whale site ever found. Full of rich storytelling and scientific discovery, Spying on Whales spans the ancient past to an uncertain future--all to better understand the most enigmatic creatures on Earth.</p><p>Nick Pyenson is the curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.

We had spent the morning looking for humpback whales in Wilhelmina Bay, threading our rubber boat between gargantuan icebergs that were tall and sharp, like overturned cathedrals. Now we stopped, cut the engine, and listened in the utter stillness for the lush, sonorous breath of an eighty-thousand-pound whale coming to the water's surface. That sound would be our cue to close in. We had come to the end of the Earth to place a removable tag on the back of one of these massive, oceangoing mammals, but we took nothing for granted in Antarctica. As we sat waiting on the small open boat, I came to feel more and more vulnerable, a speck floating in a sea of shattered ice. "Don't fall in," my longtime collaborator and friend Ari Friedlaender deadpanned.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I struggled to remember how long we had been away from the <i>Ortelius</i>, our much larger oceanic vessel with its ice-hardened steel hull. In every direction, we were enclosed by a landscape of nunataks, jagged spires of rock that pierced the creamy tops of surrounding glaciers. Where the glaciers met the sea, they ended in sheer, icy cliffs towering over the bay. Without a human structure for scale, these landforms seemed both near and far at the same time. This otherworldly scene of ice, water, rock, and light warped my sight lines, bending my sense of distance and the passage of time.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you hold your fist with your left thumb out, your thumb is the western Antarctic Peninsula; your fist, the Antarctic continent's outline. The Gerlache Strait is part of a long stretch of inner passageway along the outer side of Antarctica's left thumb, and Wilhelmina Bay cuts a rough cul-de-sac off the Gerlache. The Gerlache is a hot spot for whales, seals, penguins, and other seabirds, and Wilhelmina Bay is the bull's-eye. All come here to hunt for krill, small crustaceans that form the centerpiece of Antarctic ocean food webs. Consider your hand again: individual krill are about the length of your thumb, but whales pursue them because they explode into great aggregations, or swarms, during the Antarctic summer. With the right mixture of sunlight and nutrient-rich water, dense clouds of krill form a sort of superorganism that can stretch for miles and concentrate in hundreds of individuals per cubic foot. By some measures, there is more biomass of krill than of any other animal on the planet. Calorie-rich swarms of them lurked somewhere, not far, just under our boat.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Where there are krill in sufficient quantities, there will be whales, but the fundamental problem with studying whales is that we almost never see them, except when they come to the surface to breathe or when we dive, in our own limited fashion, in search of them. Whales are inherently enigmatic creatures because the parameters of their lives defy many of our tools to measure them: they travel over spans of whole oceans, dive to depths where light does not reach, and live for human lifetimes-and even longer.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Wilhelmina Bay our goal was to attach a sleek plastic tag to the back of a whale to record audio, video, depth, changes in the whale's speed, and even pitch, yaw, and roll. Our tags would provide crucial context for how humpbacks interact with their environment by relaying, in a time-stamped way, how they feed on krill. Ari and his colleagues have tagged and tracked whales along the Antarctic Peninsula for nearly two decades, charting their movements against the backdrop of changes in krill-patch density, water temperature, daylight, and other variables. As climate change warms the poles faster than the rest of the planet, every year counts.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sat on the gunnel of the boat while Ari scanned from the bow. We were several days into a multiweek expedition with high hopes to tag as many humpbacks as possible-ideally, a pod feeding together-but thus far we had been skunked. Ari stood rigid like a figurehead, holding a twenty-foot-long carbon-fiber pole in folded arms. The pole flexed in synchrony with the swell, the teardrop-shaped tag bobbing at one end. I watched clouds shift slowly overhead, mirroring the dappled quicksilver of the water, and wondered whether any other place on Earth could feel as alien as Antarctica. Then a loud gurgle interrupted my daydreaming, followed by a trumpeting blast of water vapor bursting from flaring, paired nostrils. A whale's blow.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We knew to expect more plumes of water immediately thereafter. A pod of whales synchronize when they surface to breathe-sometimes nearly simultaneously or split seconds apart. They usually breathe a few times in a row, in quick succession, before resubmerging-unless they're asleep or truly exhausted, whales tend to act like surfacing is a nuisance and they'd rather be deep underwater. Their tight coordination in breathing likely has a lot to do with maximizing time spent below the surface engaged in the cooperative tasks of finding food and avoiding predators. Some species travel or hunt in pods that are tightly knit family genealogies, while others, such as the humpbacks before us, form short-lived associations, seemingly a matter of happenstance.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, that's right," Ari called out. The vapor from the blow lingered in the cold air. Ari pointed to a small patch of water a dozen yards from the boat, perfectly calm against the waves at the surface. This patch, called a flukeprint, betrayed the whale's movement, unseen deep below our tiny boat. The single flukeprint bloomed into several, each the size of our boat, rising up from the depths, whirling and spreading into the smooth geometry of a lily pad. We were right. "He's got buddies," Ari said. Without the aid of an echo sounder&#x2014;which would also tip off the whales about our location&#x2014;we used the ephemeral patterns on the surface to read their path.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We started up the engine, throttling ahead slightly to a spot beyond the last flukeprint. Within seconds, right on cue, a pair of enormous nostrils bubbled at the surface, releasing a thundering tone and then a spray that carried past us as we kept up with the whale. A dorsal fin surfaced, and a second and third blow exploded nearby. "Pull up behind this last one. We have about three more breaths until they go down," Ari shouted.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We trailed the laggard of the group, maneuvering the boat into position. Ari lowered himself across the bow and held the pole against his torso, extending the tip with the tag just ahead of the dorsal fin as we motored close to the behemoths moving yards away. Then, in a decisive motion, Ari launched the tip of the pole toward the whale's back, where the tag's suction cups hit the skin with a satisfying <i>thwack</i>. The whale rolled beneath the surface as we pulled back to pause and wait for it to return. We spotted its sleek, shiny back as it arose again, marked with a neon tag, and we cheered. The whale took one last breath before it raised its monstrously wide tail flukes out of the water and slipped down into emerald darkness with the others. Ari radioed back to the <i>Ortelius</i>. "Taaaaag on," he said with a hint of swagger as he grinned at me.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The whole rodeo of tagging is a bit like sticking a smartphone on the back of a whale, complete with the logistics of getting close enough to a forty-ton mammal in the first place. Just as your smartphone can record movies, track where you go, and automatically rotate images, the same technology&#x2014;miniaturized and cheap, combining video, GPS, and accelerometers all in one device&#x2014;has fueled a revolution in understanding how animals move throughout their world. Scientists call this new way of recording organismal movement biologging, and it has captured the interest of ecologists, behavioral biologists, and anatomists, all interested in knowing the details of how animals move through space and over time. Biologging has been especially important for revealing the daily, monthly, and even annual meanderings of animals that are extremely difficult to study. Stick a tag on a penguin, a sea turtle, or a whale, and there's a chance to know how it swims, what it eats, and everything else it does whenever you're not around to watch it-which is most of the time, for animals at sea.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The logistics of studying whales places them in a realm truly apart from every other large mammal on land or at sea. To know anything about them in the wild takes time on a boat, sticking a tag on their back, sliding a camera underwater, or spying overhead with a drone&#x2014;if you're lucky enough to come upon them in the first place. Biologging is helping us overcome this challenge by giving us a remote view into their lives, an extension of our senses more intimate and sometimes more detailed than any telephoto lens. In the case of humpbacks, tag data have revealed how these gulp-feeding whales lunge at large schools of krill and other prey, oftentimes in coordinated attacks. It's a form of pack hunting, which might seem strange for a species celebrated as gentle giants. But baleen whales are serious predators, not like grazing cows but more like wolves or lions, pursuing their quarry with strategy and efficacy. Don't be fooled by their lack of teeth, or just because krill don't bleat in terror.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hours later the <i>Ortelius</i> prowled silently through Wilhelmina Bay, with a pair of massive spotlights leading the way in search of icebergs in our path. Outside on the bow, I watched heavy snowflakes drift through the cones of light as Ari unfolded the metal radio antenna that would lead us back to our tag. The tags we were using had to be re-collected to yield their data; we would have to find and physically pluck them out of the water, provided that they'd already been knocked off the whales' backs. By design, they can last minutes, hours, or even days from the force of suction alone, before being scraped, being bumped, or falling off. Its buoyant neon housing would keep the whole device floating on the surface until we triangulated its position.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of his career, Ari has probably tagged more species of whales than anyone, in all circumstances and in every ocean. Beyond friendship, mutual colleagues, shared ambitions, and wry humor, we were working together in Antarctica to build a bridge between our disciplines&#x2014;paleontology for me, ecology for him&#x2014;because questions about how whales evolved to become masters of ocean ecosystems over fifty-odd million years need to be grounded in the facts of what whales do today. Bridging gaps between disciplines sometimes necessitates spending time side by side. All the better if it's in the field.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The metal prongs that Ari assembled looked like an elaborate set of rabbit ears from an old television set. He plugged the antenna into a small receiver with a speaker, and after a few moments, we heard a series of intermittent beeps. "That gap between the beeps tells us that the whale is sleeping, rising up to the surface to breathe, and then sinking back down." Ari smiled. "Just dozing, belly full of krill. Not a bad way to spend a Saturday night." We would need to come back later and listen again for our tag until it floated freely, beeping uninterrupted.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most large baleen whale species alive today belong to the rorqual family, which feed on krill and other small prey by lunging underwater. They comprise the more familiar members of the cetacean bestiary, including humpbacks, blue whales, fin whales, and minke whales. Rorquals are also the most massive species of vertebrates ever to have evolved on the planet&#x2014;far heavier than the largest dinosaurs. Even the smallest rorquals, minke whales, can weigh ten tons as adults, about twice as much as an adult bull African elephant. Rorquals are easy to distinguish from any other baleen whale, such as a gray whale or a bowhead whale: Look for the long, corrugated throat pouch that runs from their chin to their belly button. (And yes, whales have belly buttons, just like you and me.) The features that make rorquals so obviously different from other baleen whales also play a critical role in how they feed.</p></p><h2>A Midwife&#39;s Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812</h2><p>Drawing on the diaries of a midwife and healer in eighteenth-century Maine, this intimate history illuminates the medical practices, household economies, religious rivalries, and sexual mores of the New England frontier.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>&#34;A major source through which we can vicariously experience the rural life of early New England.&#34; --Carl N.

This groundbreaking book by the most influential philosopher since Sartre compels us to reevaluate our assumptions about all the ensuing reforms in the penal institutions of the West. For as he examines innovations that range from the abolition of torture to the institution of forced labor and the appearance of the modern penitentiary, Michel Foucault suggests that punishment has shifted its locus from the prisoner&#39;s body to his soul--and that our very concern with rehabilitation encourages and refines criminal activity. Lucidly reasoned and deftly marshaling a vast body of research, Discipline and Punish is a genuinely revolutionary book, whose implications extend beyond the prison to the minute power relations of our society.</p><p></p><h2>Passion According to G.H (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>Passion According to G H</p><p>Clarice Lispector&nbsp;(1920&#x2013;1977), the greatest Brazilian writer of the twentieth century, has been called &#x201c;astounding&#x201d; (Rachel Kushner), &#x201c;a penetrating genius&#x201d; (Donna Seaman, Booklist), and &#x201c;a truly remarkable writer&#x201d; (Jonathan Franzen). &#x201c;Her images dazzle even when her meaning is most obscure,&#x201d; noted the Times Literary Supplement, &#x201c;and when she is writing of what she despises, she is lucidity itself.&#x201d;&#x201c;She is quite a thing to discover indeed.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Los Angeles Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Lispector] left behind an astounding body of work that has no real corollary inside literature or outside it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Bookforum</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Her images dazzle even when her meaning is most obscure, and when she is writing of what she despises she is lucidity itself.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Times Literary Supplement</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Over time, I&#x2019;ve come to admire and even love this novel.

And he reflects on the American character, racial hostility, on a particular form of American loneliness he finds almost everywhere, and on the unexpected kindness of strangers that is also a very real part of our national identity.</p></p><p>In September 1960, John Steinbeck and his poodle, Charley, embarked on a journey across America. A picaresque tale, this chronicle of their trip meanders along scenic backroads and speeds along anonymous superhighways, moving from small towns to growing cities to glorious wilderness oases. Travels with Charley is animated by Steinbeck&#39;s attention to the specific details of the natural world and his sense of how the lives of people are intimately connected to the rhythms of nature - to weather, geography, the cycles of the seasons. His keen ear for the transactions among people is evident, too, as he records the interests and obsessions that preoccupy the Americans he encounters along the way.<b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <b>Cup of Gold</b> (1929).<p>After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books, <b>The Pastures of Heaven</b> (1932) and <b>To a God Unknown</b> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <b>The Long Valley</b> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <b>Tortilla Flat </b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly.

They failed.<br><br>&#x201c;Then, in the autumn of 1940, they tried again.&#x201d;</b><br>So begins <i>Blood of Victory</i>, a novel rich with suspense, historical insight, and the powerful narrative immediacy we have come to expect from bestselling author Alan Furst. The book takes its title from a speech given by a French senator at a conference on petroleum in 1918: &#x201c;Oil,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the blood of the earth, has become, in time of war, the blood of victory.&#x201d;<br><br>November 1940. The Russian writer I. A. Serebin arrives in Istanbul by Black Sea freighter. Although he travels on behalf of an �migr� organization based in Paris, he is in flight from a dying and corrupt Europe&#x2014;specifically, from Nazi-occupied France. Serebin finds himself facing his fifth war, but this time he is an exile, a man without a country, and there is no army to join. Still, in the words of Leon Trotsky, &#x201c;You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.&#x201d; Serebin is recruited for an operation run by Count Janos Polanyi, a Hungarian master spy now working for the British secret services. <br><br>The battle to cut Germany&#x2019;s oil supply rages through the spy haunts of the Balkans; from the Athen�e Palace in Bucharest to a whorehouse in Izmir; from an elegant yacht club in Istanbul to the river docks of Belgrade; from a skating pond in St. Moritz to the fogbound banks of the Danube; in sleazy nightclubs and safe houses and nameless hotels; amid the street fighting of a fascist civil war.<br><br><i>Blood of Victory</i> is classic Alan Furst, combining remarkable authenticity and atmosphere with the complexity and excitement of an outstanding spy thriller. As Walter Shapiro of <i>Time</i> magazine wrote, &#x201c;Nothing can be like watching <i>Casablanca</i> for the first time, but Furst comes closer than anyone has in years.&#x201d;</p><p>I.A. Serebin, an �migr� writer who heads the International Russian Union and edits its literary magazine, is no stranger to war: "Two gangsters, one neighborhood, they fight," he comments at a dinner party on a yacht in the Istanbul harbor in the autumn of 1940. Istanbul, to which Serebin has come to say good-bye to a dying friend, is a haven for spies, arms dealers, diplomats, and intrigue. Like most of the author's protagonists, Serebin is a romantic, a reluctant hero who tries to believe that war will not really change anything: "Hold fast to life as it should be, the daily ritual, work, love, and then it will be" is his credo. After Paris falls to the Germans, he realizes that is impossible. When a French diplomat's wife, whom he met and bedded on the freighter that brought him to Turkey, puts him in touch with a Hungarian spy working with the British Secret Service, Serebin allows himself to be recruited for a mission to disrupt the flow of oil from Romania's Ploesti fields to German factories--something that has been tried by the British before, without success. Alan Furst, a master stylist whose novels are peopled with characters who remain in the reader's mind long after the last page is turned, evokes Istanbul's smoky, spicy, shadowy atmosphere with the same authenticity he brings to the settings of all his thrillers, most notably Paris. No one is better at describing both place and players in the period just before and during World War II; widely hailed as the successor to Eric Ambler and Graham Greene, Furst proves in his gripping, compulsively readable seventh novel what a contender he is for that title. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Praise for Alan Furst&#x2019;s Bestselling <b><i>Kingdom of Shadows</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Astonishingly, Alan Furst is not yet a household name. But perhaps the sixth of his supple, elegant European spy novels will do the trick, what with its beguiling sophistication, knowing political overview and utterly assured narrative tone. . . . <i>Kingdom of Shadows</i> offers a realm of glamour and peril that are seamlessly intertwined and seem to arise effortlessly from the author&#x2019;s consciousness.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Kingdom of Shadows</i> must be called a spy novel, but it transcends genre, as did some Graham Greene and Eric Ambler classics. It is one of those rare novels that provide unqualified pleasure, and I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys elegant, sophisticated, suspenseful writing.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;Subtly spun, sensitive to nuances, generous with contemporary detail and information discreetly conveyed . . .

Rousseau&#x2019;s impact on American social and political thought remains deep, wide, and, to some, even infuriating. <br><br>Leo Damrosch beautifully mines Rousseau&#x2019;s books--The Social Contract, one of the greatest works on political theory and a direct influence on the French and American revolutions; Emile, a groundbreaking treatise on education; and the Confessions, which created the genre of introspective autobiography--as works still uncannily alive and provocative to us today.<br><br>Damrosch&#x2019;s triumph is to integrate the story of Rousseau&#x2019;s extraordinarily original writings with the tumultuous life that produced them. Rousseau&#x2019;s own words and those of people who knew him help create an accessible, vivid portrait of a questing man whose strangeness--as punishing and punished lover, difficult friend, and father who famously consigned his infant children to a foundling home--still fascinates. This, the first single-volume biography of Rousseau in English, is as masterfully written as it is definitive.<br><br>Leo Damrosch is the Ernest Bernbaum Professor of Literature at Harvard University. He has written widely on eighteenth-century writers.<br>Praise for Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br><br>"Leo Damrosch's vivid biography enables us to plunge deeply into Rousseau's singular life, conjure up its crucial encounters, retrace its twisting paths, and supplement Rousseau's own claims about himself with the detailed, often contradictory testimony of the contemporaries he so unsettled and inspired." -- Stephen Greenblatt, author of Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare<br><br>"These pages bring to life the Europe of the ancien regime, a desiccated, sybaritic, superstitious, oppressive world about to be terribly and fatally convulsed. And they also bring to astonishing life a great agent of that convulsion, an impossible man whose books helped to make modern life possible. Leo Damrosch not only helps us understand Rousseau, his loves and his hates, his genius and his foolishness. He makes us see Rousseau. And, as he shows again and again in this immensely enjoyable and fast-paced story, that is Rousseau&#x2019;s special and permanent fascination--because when we see him, we are seeing ourselves."-- Louis Menand, author of The Metaphysical Club and American Studies</p><p>LEO DAMROSCH was awarded the National Endowment for the Humanities and Guggenheim fellowships, among other honors. Currently the Ernest Bernbaum Professor of literature at Harvard University, he has written widely on eighteenth-century writers. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.The thinkers who matter are those whom the world can't agree about, and usually the more a writer, philosopher or artist polarizes opinion, the better for all of us. In modern times probably no genius of the Western world still ignites such passionate controversy as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). Only Marx, Nietzsche and Freud -- in many ways, his successors -- come even close.<p>Why is this? Because Rousseau blew up the edifice of 2,500 years of classical and Christian thought about the fundamental nature of the soul and society. Until Rousseau, nearly everyone agreed that humanity was by nature sinful and vicious, and that the state, religion and other social structures imposed a needed order on our conduct. Without higher authority to moderate passions, men and women would spend their short, nasty and brutish lives like jungle beasts. From religion and education, we learn self-control and the ways of righteousness; from the laws and customs of society, we are shaped into good and useful citizens.</p><p>Not so, said this political visionary: "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." Our natural impulses are healthy and good; it is society that makes us wicked. Where once we lived in harmony with ourselves and with the world around us, now we dwell in a snake pit of appearance and inauthenticity, of competitiveness and conspicuous consumption, of inequality, prejudice and pervasive baseness. Our institutions and governments disfigure and corrupt everything they touch. We long for happiness, without recognizing that it is the system we live under that taints our souls and leaves us alienated, despairing and hungry for something we cannot even name.</p><p>How did we go so wrong? In the myth or thought experiment that Rousseau offers in his discourse On the Origin of Inequality (1755), he concludes that the serpent in the garden was nothing less than Reason. When people lived unmediated existences in accord with Nature and themselves, when they dwelt like Peter Pan in a perpetual present, they found life simple, fulfilling and harmonious. But on some evil day, one man began to compare himself with another. This led to reflection, self-awareness and eventually competitiveness, then to specialization and a division of labor to maximize individual strengths and weaknesses, and before long the floodgates were opened to envy, accumulation and excess. The clever soon exploited their fellows, stockpiled provisions and gained superfluous wealth -- and these inevitably needed to be protected by guards, by armies, by laws and statutes. And so paradise was lost.</p><p>And lost forever. Rousseau says there's no real going back. Recorded history is essentially the story of our degradation. But we can and should still strive to ameliorate inequities; we just might establish kindlier small city-states (he thought of Geneva and Corsica) where governmental regulation could be minimized and civic life made human-scaled, but, most of all, we can liberate ourselves.</p><p>Rousseau's contemporary, the arch-conservative Edmund Burke, labeled him "the Socrates of the National Assembly" (that is, of the hated French Revolution). Come the 20th century, this radical thinker had grown into the great beast of all who revere traditional institutions, worship in established churches and either fear or exploit the common man. Yet no one, of whatever political or philosophical persuasion, would deny how deeply Rousseau's sensibility pervades the past 250 years, from the poetry of the Romantics ("One impulse from a vernal wood/ May teach you more of man . . . ") to the slogans, pop songs and lifestyles of the 1960s: Drop out, "Let it be," back to Nature, hippies, communes, self-realization. Yet Rousseauian ideals also lie behind our unabated, unassuaged longings to live more humanely in a bureaucratic, technological and often unjust world. Even the staunchest meritocrat or most self-satisfied scion of inherited wealth must find it hard to discount the truth of the discourse on inequality's final ringing lines: "It is manifestly against the Law of Nature . . . that a handful of men wallow in luxury, while the famished multitudes lack the necessities of life."</p><p>Such thrilling emotional language has always contributed to Rousseau's powerful appeal. Contrary to a widespread misconception, many philosophers have also been superb prose stylists -- just think of Plato, Hume or William James -- but this largely self-educated former valet may be the finest of all. Rousseau actually had to beg his readers to disregard his "beau style" and just pay attention to his ideas. But this is impossible. His sentences are musical and absolutely limpid, at once classically balanced yet intimate, oracular and confessional. One is simply swept along, no matter what the subject.</p><p>So when Rousseau decided to write about two highly moral lovers, the result was Julie, or The New Heloise (1761), the most popular novel of the 18th century. When he published Emile, or On Education (1762), a Utopian pedagogical treatise, mothers turned it into a bible of child-rearing. (For instance, largely because of Rousseau, upper-class women began to breast-feed, rather than wet-nurse, their children.) And when Jean-Jacques finally decided to relate the story of his own checkered past, his Confessions (1782) established the modern autobiography and, to this day, remains the genre's unsurpassed and supreme achievement.</p><p>Yet self-revelation, no matter how sincere the pact to tell the whole truth and nothing but, always possesses a strategy, even an agenda. In his Confessions Rousseau hopes to justify his life against detractors and critics by confessing embarrassing intimacies -- for example, his painful need to constantly urinate -- and owning up to his most shameful memories, in particular the incrimination of an innocent servant girl for a theft he himself committed and the abandonment of his newborn children at foundling hospitals. But this public laceration serves a purpose: Before the judgment of God, can any of his readers maintain that their lives were any better? The Confessions is, at heart, an apologia.</p><p>Which is why Leo Damrosch's deeply informed biography is so welcome. Even if one knows Rousseau's extensive writing about himself -- and this includes that series of exquisite late prose-poems, the Reveries of the Solitary Walker (written in 1776) -- there is still a need for distance and for perspective, for the integration of the works with the life and the life with the times. Damrosch is an academic -- a professor of 18th-century literature at Harvard -- but he nonetheless writes for ordinary readers, with clarity, a light touch and immense zest.</p><p>Just a precis of Rousseau's life shows how remarkable he truly was, especially against the backdrop of ancien regime Europe. Born in Geneva in 1712, Rousseau was brought up by his watchmaker father, his mother having died in childbirth. At the age of 12, he was apprenticed to an engraver, soon ran away and eventually ended up hiking through much of Switzerland, northern Italy and parts of France. Along the way he encountered, like any picaresque hero, beautiful ladies, con artists, kindly priests, disdainful aristocrats. But early on he fell under the spell of a Madame de Warens, whom he called Maman and who subsequently seduced him, rather to his dismay: He says it felt like incest. Only in his thirties did Rousseau finally settle in Paris, at first aiming for a career as a musician. Though he was largely self-taught in composition (as in everything else), his opera "Le Devin du Village" ("The Village Soothsayer," 1752) proved an unexpected success (and is still staged today).</p><p>In Paris he met Therese Levasseur, a nearly illiterate young laundress, who ended up sharing the rest of his life. Choosing to earn his way as a copyist of musical scores, he preferred such a life of simplicity to the "slavery" of patronage. But intellectually that simple life proved abundantly rich, with time to think and time to argue with close friends whose names are now among the most honored in French intellectual history: Diderot, d'Alembert, Condillac. Then one day, on a walk to Vincennes to visit the temporarily imprisoned Diderot, Rousseau happened to see an advertisement in the Mercure de France for an essay contest. He entered it with his Discourse on the Sciences and Arts (1750), won and found himself famous. He was 38, and his real career was finally beginning.</p><p>During the next dozen years, Rousseau produced all his major philosophical work, including his most famous, The Social Contract (1762), which argues what most Americans believe: that the people alone are sovereign, that they possess inalienable rights and that government exists to carry out the general will. But as the years went by, this upstart thinker inevitably quarreled with the shrewdest mind (and finest writer) in Europe -- Voltaire, bien sur -- and gradually grew apart from his old philosophe friends. He fell in love with an aristocratic lady, already married and with an established lover; and, as you would expect, things ended badly. In due course, the authorities decided to ban (and even burn) The Social Contract, so to avoid arrest Rousseau fled into exile, first to Switzerland (where his house was stoned), then to England (traveling there in the company of David Hume). He was hounded, spied upon, hunted. Yet even those with real enemies can grow paranoid, and Rousseau grew crazily suspicious of those around him. Nonetheless, he found occasional oases of tranquility in his later life and died quietly in a house near Paris provided for him by an aristocratic admirer. His last unfinished works, especially the Reveries of the Solitary Walker, show that his prose remained unsurpassed in eloquence to the very end.</p><p>But a passionate eloquence about the human heart and the human condition characterize Rousseau's writing at any point in his life. As a very young man, employed as teacher for a Lyon family, he penned a memorandum outlining his theory of pedagogy. In the middle of these proposals -- which years later found fuller exposition in Emile -- he pauses to ask himself what Damrosch calls "an altogether unexpected question that is prophetic of his entire life's work." Rousseau writes: "Nothing is more depressing than the general fate of men. And yet they feel in themselves a consuming desire to become happy, and it makes them feel at every moment that they were born to be happy. So why are they not?"</p><p>We still argue about the answer to that question. Whether you agree or disagree with Rousseau's view of man's natural goodness and the evils inherent in civilization, his is nonetheless a voice that simply won't go away. Why are we not happy? Why? Why? Damrosch's biography provides an ideal introduction to both this complex man and his troubling ideas. It is an important book, but also a provocative and exceptionally entertaining one. </p><p>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

I found it entertaining that such a hardened man of the world could have gained so much experience as scientist, explorer, natural historian, naval surgeon, and taxidermist and still let himself be nettled by a woman half his size. The thin, silvered scar that trailed from brow to jaw on one side of his face was not at all disfiguring. Quite the opposite, in fact. But it was a constant reminder of the failed Amazonian expedition that had destroyed his career and his marriage and nearly ended his life. It was not entirely sporting of me to mention it, but we had begun to pluck one another&#x2019;s nerves in recent days, and it had been his idea to train me in the combative arts as a way to exorcise our bad tempers.

Situated on the grounds of his lordship&#x2019;s Marylebone estate, Bishop&#x2019;s Folly, the Belvedere was a singularly extraordinary structure. It had been built as a sort of freestanding ballroom and storehouse for an eccentric Rosemorran ancestor, and it served our purposes beautifully. The Rosemorrans were tireless collectors and had stuffed their London mansion, Scottish shooting box, and Cornish country seat clear to the rafters with treasures of every description. Art, artifacts, natural history specimens, mementos&#x2014;all of them had found their way into the grasping, aristocratic hands of the Rosemorrans. After four generations of acquisition, the present earl had decided the time had come to assemble a formal and permanent exhibition, and Stoker and I had been given the task of establishing the museum. The fact that we were somewhat qualified to undertake such a feat&#x2014;and recently homeless as well as in need of employment&#x2014;had spurred the earl to make the thing official. The first order of business ought to have been a thorough inventory of all the Rosemorrans had acquired. It would be tiresome, backbreaking, tedious work, but necessary. Before the first display cabinet was built, before the first exhibit could be sketched or the first tag penned, we must have a complete accounting of what we had to work with.</p><p>So naturally we planned a trip instead. We had spent all of July and August of that year charting an expedition to the South Pacific, poring over maps and happily debating the relative merits of each location with regard to my interest in butterflies and Stoker&#x2019;s rather less elevated interest in shooting things.</p><p>&#x201c;I do not shoot things for my own pleasure,&#x201d; he had argued indignantly. &#x201c;I only collect specimens for the purposes of scientific study.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That must be some consolation to the corpses,&#x201d; I returned sweetly.</p><p>&#x201c;You do not hold the moral high ground there, my little assassin. I have watched you kill butterflies by the hundreds with just a pinch of your fingers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I could pin them first, but I am not an enthusiast of torture.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You might have fooled me,&#x201d; he muttered. I passed off that bit of ill humor for what it was&#x2014;sulking over the fact that our patron had sided with me in choosing the Fijian islands for our expedition. The location was a veritable paradise for a lepidopterist but offered little excitement for a student of Mammalia.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t grumble. The Fijian islands are rich with specimens for you to study,&#x201d; I told Stoker with more kindness than veracity.</p><p>He fixed me with a cold look. &#x201c;I have been to Fiji,&#x201d; he informed me. &#x201c;There are bats and whales. Do you know who is interested in bats and whales? Precisely no one.&#x201d;</p><p>I waved a hand. &#x201c;Feathers. The Fijians boast a very nice little fruit bat you might enjoy.&#x201d;</p><p>What he said next does not bear repeating in a polite memoir, but I replied casually that Lord Rosemorran had mentioned calling in at Sarawak as long as we were in that part of the world. Unlike Fiji, this destination would afford Stoker everything from panthers to pangolins for study.</p><p>He brightened considerably at this, and by the time our preparations were concluded, any casual observer might have been forgiven for thinking the destination had been his idea from the first. He threw himself into the planning with enthusiasm, arranging everything to his satisfaction&#x2014;arrangements I quietly reworked to my satisfaction. The travel documents were in order, the trunks were packed, and a fever of anticipation settled over Bishop&#x2019;s Folly. All that remained was to depart, and Lord Rosemorran made a protracted leave-taking of his home, his children, his sister, his staff, and his beloved pets. It was the last that was to prove our downfall.</p><p>Returning from one last walk in the gardens where he housed his snail collection, his lordship managed to trip over his giant tortoise, Patricia, a tremendous creature who shambled about the grounds so slowly she was often mistaken for dead. How Lord Rosemorran managed to trip over an animal whose nearest relation was a boulder mystified me entirely, but the cause was not the concern. It was the effect which proved devastating. His lordship sustained a compound fracture of the thigh, a painful and thoroughly disgusting injury which Stoker assured me would take many months to heal. His experience as a naval surgeon&#x2019;s mate had qualified him to take one look at the protruding bone and turn to me with instructions to see to the unpacking. The Rosemorran&#x2013;Speedwell&#x2013;Templeton-Vane expedition was officially canceled.</p><p>Whilst Stoker was extremely useful in a crisis, his medical expertise was soon usurped by that of his lordship&#x2019;s own physicians and we were left cooling our heels in the Belvedere, sniping at one another in our frustration. We had each of us hoped to be shipboard once more, sea breezes blowing away the stultifying air of England as tropical climes beckoned with balmy winds and star-blazoned skies. Instead we were cooped up like hapless chickens nesting on our disappointed hopes. Even the opportunity to clear out the Belvedere did not entirely restore our good humor, although I should point out that Stoker&#x2019;s fit of pique lasted far longer than mine. But then, in my experience, gentlemen are champion sulkers so long as one doesn&#x2019;t call the behavior by that name. It was in such a state of heightened irritation that he&#x2014;mindful of our previous perilous encounters&#x2014;took it upon himself to instruct me in the defensive arts.</p><p>&#x201c;Splendid idea,&#x201d; I had replied enthusiastically. &#x201c;What shall we shoot?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not giving you a firearm,&#x201d; he told me in a tone of flat refusal. &#x201c;I do not like them. They are noisy, unreliable, and can be taken away and used against you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So can a knife,&#x201d; I grumbled.</p><p>He pretended not to hear as he extracted the blade he regularly carried in his boot. He erected a target&#x2014;an old tailor&#x2019;s dummy unearthed from the Belvedere&#x2014;and set about teaching me with maddening condescension how to murder it.</p><p>&#x201c;It is one smooth motion, Veronica,&#x201d; he said for the hundredth time. &#x201c;Keep your wrist straight, and think of the knife as an extension of your arm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is a singularly useless piece of instruction,&#x201d; I informed him, affecting a casual air as the knife bounced off the dummy&#x2019;s groin and flopped to the grass.</p><p>Stoker retrieved it. &#x201c;Try again,&#x201d; he ordered.</p><p>I threw again, skimming the dummy&#x2019;s head as Stoker explained the desirability of various targets. &#x201c;The neck is nice and soft, but also narrow and unreliable. If you really want to hinder a man, throw for his thigh. A good hit to the meat of his leg will slow him down, and if you happen to nick the femoral artery, you will stop him for good. You could try for the stomach, but if he is a stout fellow, it will merely lodge in his fat and make him angry.&#x201d;</p><p>He proceeded to lecture me for the next hour, about what I cannot say, for as I flung the knife with varying degrees of effort and success, I had leisure to be alone with my own thoughts.</p><p>&#x201c;Veronica,&#x201d; he said at last as the knife sailed past the dummy altogether. &#x201c;What the bollocking hell was that?&#x201d; He fetched the knife and handed it back, suddenly blushing furiously.</p><p>The cause of Stoker&#x2019;s distress was the unexpected appearance of his lordship&#x2019;s sister, Lady Cordelia Beauclerk. I turned and waved the knife at her.</p><p>&#x201c;Forgive his language, Lady C. Stoker is in a terrible fuss. He has been sulking ever since his lordship broke his leg. How is the patient today?&#x201d;</p><p>Mindful of Stoker&#x2019;s baleful glance, I lowered the knife with exaggerated care.</p><p>&#x201c;A trifle feverish, but the doctor says he has the constitution of an ox, although you would never know it to look at him,&#x201d; she said with a smile. That much was true. His lordship had always resembled a librarian in the latter stages of anemia&#x2014;pale and stooped from too many years poring over his books. But blood will tell, and Beauclerk blood was hearty stuff. Lady C. always looked the picture of health, from her English rose complexion to her slender figure. But as I assessed her, I noted an unaccustomed furrow to her brow, and her usually pink cheeks seemed lacking in color.</p><p>&#x201c;You must be working yourself to death taking care of him as well as the house,&#x201d; I observed.</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;Things are a bit at sixes and sevens,&#x201d; she admitted. &#x201c;The doctor has ordered trained nurses in to tend his lordship, and I am afraid Mrs. Bascombe doesn&#x2019;t care for the extra work of looking after them.&#x201d; I was not surprised. His lordship&#x2019;s housekeeper put me in mind of unripe quinces&#x2014;plump and sour. Lady C. went on. &#x201c;And of course it&#x2019;s time to pack the boys up for school and the girls have a new governess to settle in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For the moment,&#x201d; Stoker murmured. The Beaucleark girls had a habit of driving away hapless governesses with well-timed hysterics or the odd spider in the bed. I rather thought it a pity that no one had told them about the efficacy of syrup of figs dribbled into the morning tea, but it was not my place to tutor them in misdemeanors.</p><p>Lady Cordelia smiled her gentle smile. &#x201c;For the moment,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;But everything seems in hand this afternoon&#x2014;so much so that I have decided to pay a visit to the Curiosity Club.&#x201d;</p><p>My ears pricked up. Known formally as the Hippolyta Club, it was an intriguing place, founded for the purposes of free discourse amongst accomplished ladies without the strictures of society limiting their conversation. That might have been the raison d&#x2019;�tre of the club, but like most high-minded institutions, it was entirely bound by its own set of Byzantine and impenetrable rules. Lady Cordelia had been admitted on the strength of a series of papers she had written on the subject of advanced mathematics, and it was good to see that her talents&#x2014;frequently wasted in arguing with Mrs. Bascombe about the grocer&#x2019;s bills&#x2014;were once more carrying her into the circles where her intellect was most appreciated. Her own family thought of her as a sort of performer, conjuring numbers as a dancing bear waltzes to a tune. Her grave, calm eyes never belied the frustration she must have felt at being so frequently ignored or brushed aside, even by kindly and well-meaning hands, but I harbored outrage enough for both of us.</p><p>Lady Cordelia gave me a benign look. &#x201c;You have put on a brave face, but I know how disappointed you must be at not embarking upon the expedition,&#x201d; she began.</p><p>&#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; I did not make a habit of lying, but it was not Lady C.&#x2019;s fault the expedition had been beached, and she had never been anything other than gracious to me. I had sensed in her&#x2014;if not a kindred spirit&#x2014;at least a sympathetic one.</p><p>&#x201c;You lie very well,&#x201d; she said mildly. &#x201c;But you are a world explorer, Miss Speedwell. I have heard you speak too eloquently of your travels not to understand how much you love the chase.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, perhaps,&#x201d; I temporized.</p><p>She went on. &#x201c;I know you have much work to do here, but I thought you might like to visit the club, as my guest. A little change of scene to sweeten the mood,&#x201d; she added with a glance to Stoker.</p><p>I pursed my lips. &#x201c;If you want to sweeten the mood, you would be far better placed taking him. But it is kind of you to offer. Yes, thank you. I would like to go.&#x201d;</p><p>The little furrow between her brows smoothed, although if anything she seemed even less at ease than she had before I accepted. &#x201c;Excellent. If you would like to collect your things, I will meet you in the drive.&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked in surprise. &#x201c;Now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. I thought we could go for tea,&#x201d; she said. Her gaze drifted over my working costume. &#x201c;Perhaps a change of attire?&#x201d; she suggested gently.</p><p>I glanced at the enormous canvas pinafore swathing me from collar to ankles. It was an unflattering garment, to be sure, and streaked with paint, blood, dust, and the remains of a profiterole Stoker had flung at me earlier. I whisked off the offending pinafore to reveal a simple gown of red foulard. It was not a fashionable creation by any standards, but I eschewed fashion, preferring to have my working clothes tailored to my specifications rather than the latest whims of the rich and idle. Narrow skirts and an unobtrustive bustle were my only concessions to modernity.</p><p>Lady Cordelia gave a vague smile. &#x201c;Very charming, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d; She paused and looked to my hair, her lips parted as if to say more, but she left us then, as swiftly as she had come.</p><p>I turned to Stoker, shoving a few errant locks into the heavy Psyche knot at my neck. With a smile of deliberate malice, I turned and&#x2014;in a single liquid motion&#x2014;flung the blade, lodging it firmly between the target&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I am off to take tea at the Curiosity Club. Mind you take good care of that dummy.&#x201d;</p><p></p><br><p>Chapter Two</p><p>I settled myself comfortably opposite Lady Cordelia in one of the Beauclerk town carriages, mindful of her maid, Sidonie, who watched balefully from an upstairs window of Bishop&#x2019;s Folly.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought Sidonie accompanied ...</p></p><h2>The Book Of Disquiet (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>With its astounding hardcover reviews Richard Zenith&#39;s new complete translation of THE BOOK OF DISQUIET has now taken on a similar iconic status to ULYSSES, THE TRIAL or IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME as one of the greatest but also strangest modernist texts.

With original research and keen insights, Ted Gioia&#x2015;the author of a landmark study of West Coast jazz and the critically acclaimed <em>The History of Jazz</em>&#x2015;brings to life the stirring music of the Delta, evoking the legendary figures who shaped its sound and ethos: Robert Johnson, Charley Patton, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, B. B. King, and others. Tracing the history of the Delta blues from the field hollers and plantation music of the nineteenth century to the exploits of modern-day musicians in the Delta tradition, <em>Delta Blues</em> tells the full story of this timeless and unforgettable music. No cultural force boasts such humble origins or such world-conquering reverberations. In this evocative rags-to-riches tale, Gioia shows how the sounds of the Delta altered the course of popular music in America and in the world beyond. 38 illustrations</p><p>An authority on jazz and blues, Ted Gioia is the founder and editor of jazz.com. He has recorded several CDs as a pianist and composer and is the author of five highly regarded books on jazz and roots music. He lives in Plano, Texas.Starred Review. Gioia (<i>The History of Jazz</i>) succeeds admirably in the daunting task of crafting a comprehensive history of the art form known as the blues, depicting the life story of the music from its cradle in the Mississippi Delta all the way to its worldwide influence on contemporary sounds. His sweeping examination focuses on the legends in detail, including Charley Patton, Son House, Tommy Johnson, Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, B.B. King and many more. He often deconstructs myths, such as the story that both Tommy Johnson and Robert Johnson made midnight deals with the devil at the crossroads, and digs deep to clarify many murky stories, including untruths and wild speculations about the life and early death of Robert Johnson. His narrative follows the northern migration of the blues to Chicago, where Muddy Waters recorded for Chess Records, and along the way he analyzes the influence of Delta blues on Elvis, the Rolling Stones and other rock 'n' roll icons. Gioia dissects many songs, but he doesn't write beyond the understanding of general readers, creating the rare combination of a tome that is both deeply informative and enjoyable to read. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1993, Kary Mullis has frequently been at odds with the scientific establishment. Legendary for his invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which redefined the world of DNA and genetics, Mullis is also an accomplished surfer, a veteran of Berkeley in the sixties, and perhaps the only Nobel laureate to describe a possible encounter with aliens. A scientist of boundless curiosity who refuses to accept any proposition based on secondhand or hearsay evidence, he is brilliant, funny, provocative, and charismatic.<br><br>In <i>Dancing Naked in the Mind Field</i> Mullis writes with passion and humor about a wide range of subjects: from the scientific method to parapsychology, from poisonous spiders to the HIV virus and AIDS, from global warming to astrology, from the O. J. Simpson trial to how you can turn a light bulb on with your mind. A multidimensional playland of ideas, this book challenges us to question the authority of scientific dogma even as it reveals the workings of an uncannily original scientific mind.</p><p>Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize for his invention of the polymerase chain reaction, a chemical procedure that allows scientists to "see" the structures of the molecules of genes. Mullis is no shy, socially inept bench chemist, though; on the contrary, he has led as big and full a life as possible, opening himself to experiences like hallucinogenic drugs, surfing, casually handling dangerous chemicals, and taking shots at the sacred cows of science. <i>Dancing Naked in the Mind Field</i> is Mullis's own chronicle of his adventures, from wooing countless women to possibly being abducted by aliens, and it's a funny, shocking tale indeed. This man certainly doesn't suffer from lack of self-esteem, and yet you might want him along on a trip to the astral plane, say, or a tour of the human genome. Mullis is a fascinating character and his autobiography will put to rest forever the stereotype of scientist as skeptical nerd. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><i>Dancing Naked in the Mind Field</i> is one of the most mind-stretching and inspirational books I've read for a long time.

He reaches over and touches his wife's breast. She sits bolt upright and exclaims, "Those are for the baby!" Jim is crushed. He dashes out of bed and jumps in the shower.<br><br>Margarita and Carlos are about to make love one night when the baby starts crying. Carlos jokes, "Damn! This baby must have a radar for our lovemaking. He's saying, 'No sibs for me!'" Margarita doesn't laugh. She gets up. Carlos grabs her nightgown, pulls her back, and, a little irritably says, "Stay. He can just calm himself. The trouble is you never give him the chance to." Margarita frowns, once again gets up, and Carlos utters another "Damn!" under his breath. She hears him. When she returns to bed a while later, she expects Carlos to be angry. But surprisingly, Carlos apologizes and says that he understands why she had to go to the baby. He offers to go the next time the baby cries. Now she cries, but in gratitude. Exhausted, both of them feel closer again and cuddle together. They fall asleep in each other's arms, as the baby sleeps through his first night.<br><br>Across the street, Debbie comes to breakfast with her baby. Her husband, Harry, sits down to eat, too, but pulls his chair over to the portable TV. Debbie says, "Can't you turn that thing off and spend breakfast with me and the baby?" Harry says, "Shut up and stop nagging! I just want to hear the news before work. Anyway, what do you want me for? You sure as hell don't want me at night. I'm pretty worthless to you, aren't I? What do you care how hard I work, or when I help out around here? You're the one driving me away. All you want is to be with that baby." Debbie yells, "What is it with you men? Can't you get it that when a woman has a baby hanging on her all day, she doesn't want a man hanging on her all night?" Harry gets up and leaves with the portable TV, slamming the door behind him.<br><br>A few blocks away, there's a different picture. Jason and his partner, Shanique, play with their six-month-old son, Marcus, who's getting a fresh diaper on the changing table. Marcus is watching his parents with eyes like saucers. Jason sings, "I'm gonna . . . get . . . your . . . belly!" and he gives Marcus a big loud kiss on the belly. Marcus giggles and flashes Jason a gorgeous smile. Jason and Shanique both dive in, tickling and blowing on their baby's tummy. The baby wiggles and squeals with laughter. Shanique and Jason pick him up, fresh and clean, and dance over the living-room floor.<br><br>What's the difference between these families? They all have new babies, they all face the same joys and the same stresses, and yet some are so happy, and some are not. In our research, we've discovered that everyone has the best of intentions after their babies are born. But some couples weather the transition beautifully, others stumble but regain their footing, while still others fall . . . and keep falling.<br><br>First, though, before we examine what distinguishes one group of couples from another, let's answer a more fundamental question: Who is having babies in this country?<br><br>BABIES ARE MOSTLY BORN TO COUPLES<br><br>About 4.5 million babies are born each year in the United States. The vast majority are born to married couples, not single moms. But the numbers are changing dramatically. In 1980, the estimate was that 18.4 percent of all babies were born to single moms. By 2003, the figure increased to 34.6 percent--over a third of all babies born in this country. These figures suggest that single motherhood is on the rise. There's a fear that children born to single moms are at greater risk for poverty, neglect, and maltreatment. Some say that if these babies were born to couples committed to staying together, their families would be much better off.<br><br>These statistics are highly misleading. A recent study in twenty-one American cities found that unwed mothers are rarely alone. Independent of race and ethnicity, a whopping 82 percent of these moms are romantically involved with the fathers of their babies. Sixty percent of these couples live together and are gallantly struggling to make it. So the overwhelming majority of unwed mothers are partnered already with the dads of their babies. "Single" motherhood, at least in the first year of Baby's life, is largely a myth.<br><br>As we travel around the nation conducting our workshops for birth educators, we also see men in every social class and ethnic group wanting to be better fathers and partners. Many men have experienced absentee fathers whom they either have never met or who disappeared early from their families. They don't want to repeat their fathers' mistakes. They want a different life for themselves. Many of them want families even more than friends or careers.<br><br>All told, this means that nearly all babies are born to couples, married or not. And couples are showing a profound commitment these days to creating not just babies, but healthy families. That's what this book is all about.<br><br>THE SOUP WE'RE ALL IN<br><br>There's an old joke about a man who goes to a restaurant, and after his soup arrives he calls the waiter over. He says to the waiter, "Taste the soup." The waiter assures him that this soup has taken weeks to prepare, and that the chef is one of the finest in the city. The man again says to the waiter, "Taste the soup." The waiter offers more assurances. He brings over framed restaurant reviews that all mention the soup. The man nods and smiles and again says to the waiter, "Taste the soup." Finally, exasperated, the waiter says, "All right. I'll taste the soup . . . Where's the spoon?" "Aha!" the man says.<br><br>There's no way for us to know how our lives will change after our baby arrives. We think we'll be full of joy. Everyone tells us that there's nothing more exciting than a new baby. Babies are the natural culmination of the love we share. They are the dawning of new hope. Babies delight us with their cuteness and draw us into their peaceful, loving world. They are soft and tender, helpless and small. They need us. They call us to love and nurture them. They are also very nice people. They openly greet us, and they eagerly play with us. They engage us, imitate us, and smile at us. Once we get to know our babies, we think, maybe our species is good and fine after all.<br><br>But sometimes we find that we may have cooked up a tasty fantasy. Once the realities of new parenthood set in, the stresses stand out, too, like too much salt in a dish.<br><br>Our thirteen-year research study with 130 young families uncovered a startling fact: In the first three years after babies were born, a whopping two-thirds of parents experienced a significant drop in their couple relationship quality. Being with Baby tasted so sweet, but being together as partners turned bitter; increases in conflict and hostility soured family life.<br><br>If these research results are representative, we're talking about an overwhelming majority of American families who suffer from relationship distress after children come. We heard many stories like these (the following names and identifying details were changed).<br><br>Angelica complained that her husband expects her to do almost all of the housework and child care even though she now works half-time. Robert said that he now works not only full-time but does a lot of overtime as well, and that should count for something.<br><br>She sarcastically said, "Thank you, Your Highness. But you can change this diaper right now as part of your overtime at home."<br><br>He snickered. "No way. I'll change a wet diaper, but the poop ones are all yours."<br><br>She did not laugh. She changed the diaper.<br><br>Jonathan and Jenny sat on a couch together during an interview. He said, "Jenny's too involved with the baby. She's got no limits. She doesn't get that we have to save our money now. She'll spend a week's salary just so the baby will look cute when she brings him out to her friends. It's like our baby is Barbie. She's totally impractical."<br><br>She said, "You don't understand! Our baby outgrows everything so fast. Besides, I am not impractical. I resent that! You're just a cheapskate who doesn't earn enough money. I had to get that new stroller. The old one wasn't safe."<br><br>He shot back, "All I ever hear out of your mouth are zingers, nothing but criticism. What about all the good stuff I do? "<br><br>She whipped out, "Whenever you do anything, you don't do it right, so I have to do it all over again." She laughed.<br><br>He said, "Another zinger."<br><br>The two of them ended up sitting next to each other, not talking, stone-faced and looking straight ahead.<br><br>These examples are typical. In our research, we score videotapes of couples discussing problems in detail, second by second. Here's what we see: The couples in trouble are critical, defensive, and disrespectful with each other. They are blind to their partner's point of view, and they can't compromise. They often say things they later regret. Not surprisingly, most of these couples have elevated heart rates during their arguments. Their fights feel like tripping through mine fields. Their partners seem like enemies, not allies. Apparently, their partners don't even like them, let alone respect them. Over time, both partners are haunted by feeling unappreciated, neglected, and lonely.<br><br>How does this calamity happen when there should only be joy? The story seems to be this: When a baby arrives, a couple's intimacy deteriorates. Sex, romance, and passion often decline. The relationship shifts its center to the baby. Husbands and wives who were once friends and lovers no longer have time for each other. Dating stops entirely, and long conversations disappear. Both parents get lonely, and can be drawn to others outside the marriage. Most affairs occur after children come. Family time is now battle time.<br><br>Worse yet, battles get ...</p><h2>Glimpses of the Profound: Four Short Works</h2><p><b>A collection of Ch�gyam Trungpa's early teachings in North America--on buddha nature, emptiness, the feminine principle, and the three bodies of enlightenment.</b><br>At the beginning of a North American teaching career that would span seventeen years, the meditation master Ch�gyam Trungpa conducted five pivotal seminars covering various dharmic topics.

It's about spirituality, not religiosity. Instead of being limited by the differences that divide people, the wisdom of the Names transcends humanity's age-old quarrels and belief systems to deal with one common bond that unifies all people and nations as one &#x2014; the human soul.</p><p>The 72 names of God were originally decoded from letters found in a biblical passage describing Moses' miraculous parting of the Red Sea. Rabbi Yehuda Berg translates these 72 names into familiar spiritual concepts, and shows readers how to these names can be useful creeds on the journey toward enlightenment. He explains that "the mystical power of the Hebrew letters that parted those waters can likewise part whatever Red Sea now confronts you in your own life." The letters may be ancient, but Berg's names read like modern catchphrases: "Angelic Influences," "Soul Mate," "Dumping Depression," and "Sexual Energy." Each one gets its own elegantly designed chapter and high impact graphic. Like most Kabbalah teachers, Berg emphasizes the importance of taming ego. Yet Berg also discusses how to keep the ego in check while still attaining sexual satisfaction and prosperity&#x2014;tricky, but possible. With its stylized presentation and contemporary language, this makes a unique and inviting book on the Kabbalah. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>This self-help book from Rabbi Berg (The Power of Kabbalah) draws upon the "72 names" of God mentioned in the Kabbalah to empower individuals to embrace life more fully. Berg says that when Moses experienced his do-or-die moment on the shores of the Red Sea, God spoke to the Israelites in three verses as recorded in the Book of Exodus-each verse consisting of 72 Hebrew letters. Encoded in those letters was the "technology" the Israelites needed to escape the situation on their own, without further divine assistance. Berg writes that contemporary seekers can also tap into this power and energy by learning about, and calling upon, the 72 names of God. The book can be shallow, particularly in its proof-texting of both Kabbalah and the findings of modern scientists to demonstrate "uncanny congruencies between astrophysics and Kabbalah concerning Creation," or its rapid-fire determination to whiz through each name in a single page. Although the device of using the 72 names is a refreshing addition to self-help literature, the end result is the same: the book offers individuals a relatively quick and painless way to achieve joy, financial prosperity, sexual fulfillment and spiritual enlightenment. The real star here is not the writing but the layout; rarely has a Kabbalah book been so easy on the eyes. Trendy designs, chic photographs and illustrations, and even a little comic-book-style graphic art enhance the book and maintain reader interest.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>New York Cookbook</h2><p>More than five hundred recipes celebrate the passion for food with New York specialities ranging from Codfish Puffs to Braised Lamb Shanks to Kreplach</p><p>NIBBLES AND NOSHES<p> Falafel, fritters, and the Four Seasons' Salmon Rillettes.

Informed by the Celtic mystical tradition &#34;Anam Cara&#34; (which means soul friend) re-examines the contemporary perception of spirituality and argues that instead of seeking to satisfy our spiritual hunger on an everlasting journey of exploration that will uncover every riddle, every mystery, we should seek to gain an understanding that the soul lies within us always. It is ever present and ever ready to dispense peace and wisdom to enhance our life experience. Using the ancient Celtic reverence for the spirit of all things and the celebration of the continuous mysteries of everyday existence which survive to this day.

He became a teacher of grammar at Tagaste, and lived much under the influence of his mother and his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome and soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the philosophy of the Sceptics and of the Neo-Platonists. His studies of Paul's letters with Alypius and the preaching of Bishop Ambrose led in 386 to his rejection of all sensual habits and to his famous conversion from mixed beliefs to Christianity. He returned to Tagaste and there founded a religious community. In 395 or 396 he became Bishop of Hippo, and was henceforth engrossed with duties, writing and controversy. He died at Hippo during the successful siege by the Vandals.</p><p> </p><p> From Augustine's large output the Loeb Classical Library offers that great autobiography the <i>Confessions</i> (in two volumes); <i>On the City of God</i> (seven volumes), which unfolds God's action in the progress of the world's history, and propounds the superiority of Christian beliefs over pagan in adversity; and a selection of <i>Letters</i> which are important for the study of ecclesiastical history and Augustine's relations with other theologians.</p></p><p></p><h2>Time Line Therapy and the Basis of Personality</h2><p>Tad James utilizes NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) to eliminate irritating behaviors or issues.

Scott Peck wrote <i>People of the Lie</i> in 1983 he offered readers a fascinating glimpse into the human face of evil. His spiritual/psychological profile of people who were narcissistic as well as evil was especially disturbing because so many of us have faced relatives, co-workers, and even spouses with this destructive combination. However, one of his most chilling chapters in that book was titled "Of Possession and Exorcism," in which he explored an even more sinister form of evil&#x2014;the possibility that the devil and smaller demonic spirits could entrench themselves into a human&#x2019;s soul. That chapter briefly described two clients who Peck believed were possessed by the devil. Ultimately he performed an exorcism with each client. <p> In <i>Glimpses of the Devil</i>, Peck returns to this dark and controversial chapter, expanding upon his beliefs in demonic possession. Like many science-educated professionals, Peck was a skeptic when it came to believing in the devil. But here he gives readers the complete story of his conversion as well as a full account of the two clinical cases that made him a believer as well as an exorcist. Because he videotaped the exorcisms, the dialog and scene work is stunningly authentic and convincing. </p><p> Some have criticized this discussion as disappointingly dry. One might argue that Peck&#x2019;s restraint when it comes to dramatics and sensationalism is this book&#x2019;s strength. Peck&#x2019;s mission is not to entertain, but rather to request a more expansive discussion of evil, so that science entertains the possibility of the devil and demonic entities. He also hopes that we will begin a serious discussion of interventions against demonic possession that aren&#x2019;t limited to the restraints of the Catholic Church. </p><p> Fans of Peck may also discover an unexpected gift within this controversial discussion. Peck is now an elder. Once a best-selling icon, he is aging into humbleness, comfortably admitting his mistakes and arrogance when it came to those early exorcisms. This softness and humility seem to elevate his authority, and we can only hope that he will offer more books from this voice in the years to come. --<i>Gail Hudson</i></p><b>M. Scott Peck's</b> publishing history reflects his own evolution as a serious and widely acclaimed writer, thinker, psychiatrist, and spiritual guide. Since his groundbreaking bestseller, <i>The Road Less Traveled,</i> was first published in 1978, his insatiable intellectual curiosity has taken him in various new directions with virtually each new book: the subject of healing human evil in <i>People of the Lie</i> (1982), where he first briefly discussed exorcism and possession; the creative experience of community in <i>The Different Drum</i> (1987); the role of civility in personal relationships and society in <i>A World Waiting to Be Born</i> (1993); an examination of the complexities of life and the paradoxical nature of belief in <i>Further Along the Road Less Traveled</i> (1993); and an exploration of the medical, ethical, and spiritual issues of euthanasia in <i>Denial of the Soul</i> (1999); as well as a novel, a children's book, and other works. A graduate of both Harvard University and Case Western Reserve, Dr. Peck served in the Army Medical Corps before maintaining a private practice in psychiatry. For the last twenty years, he has devoted much of his time and financial resources to the work of the Foundation for Community Encouragement, a nonprofit organization that he helped found in 1984.

But their rivalries divided them in endless battles for supremacy. Until one dark lord at last united the Sith in the quest to enslave the galaxy&#x2013;and exterminate the Jedi. Yet it would fall to another, far more powerful than the entire Brotherhood of Darkness, to ultimately realize the full potential of the Sith, and wield the awesome power of the dark side as never before.<br>Since childhood, Dessel has known only the abuse of his hateful father and the dangerous, soul-crushing labor of a cortosis miner. Deep in the tunnels of the desolate planet Apatros, endlessly excavating the rare mineral valued throughout the galaxy, Dessel dreams of the day he can escape&#x2013;a day he fears may never come. But when a high-stakes card game ends in deadly violence, Dessel suddenly finds himself a wanted man.<br><br>On the run from vengeful Republic forces, Dessel vanishes into the ranks of the Sith army, and ships out to join the bloody war against the Republic and its Jedi champions. There, Dessel&#x2019;s brutality, cunning, and exceptional command of the Force swiftly win him renown as a warrior. But in the eyes of his watchful masters, he is destined for a far greater role in the ultimate Sith plan for the galaxy&#x2013;if he can prove himself truly worthy.<br><br>As an acolyte in the Sith academy, studying the secrets and skills of the dark side at the feet of its greatest masters, Dessel embraces his new Sith identity: Bane. However the true test is yet to come. In order to gain acceptance into the Brotherhood of Darkness one must fully surrender to the dark side through a trial by fire that Bane, for all his unquenchable fury and lust for power, may not be strong enough to endure . . . especially since deception, treachery, and murder run rampant among the Sith disciples, and utter ruthlessness alone is the key to survival. Only by defying the most sacred traditions, rejecting all he has been taught, and drawing upon the long-forgotten wisdom of the very first Sith can Bane hope to triumph&#x2013;and forge from the ashes of that which he must destroy a new era of absolute dark power.</p><p>Drew Karpyshyn is a fantasy and science fiction novelist and an award-winning writer/designer for the computer game company, Bioware, where he was lead writer on the popular Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video game. He lives in Canada&#x2019;s hinterlands of the Great White North with his loving wife, Jen, and their cat.1<br><br> Dessel was lost in the suffering of his job, barely even aware of his surroundings. His arms ached from the endless pounding of the hydraulic jack. Small bits of rock skipped off the cavern wall as he bored through, ricocheting off his protective goggles and stinging his exposed face and hands. Clouds of atomized dust filled the air, obscuring his vision, and the screeching whine of the jack filled the cavern, drowning out all other sounds as it burrowed centimeter by agonizing centimeter into the thick vein of cortosis woven into the rock before him.<br><br> Impervious to both heat and energy, cortosis was prized in the construction of armor and shielding by both commercial and military interests, especially with the galaxy at war. Highly resistant to blaster bolts, cortosis alloys supposedly could withstand even the blade of a lightsaber. Unfortunately, the very properties that made it so valuable also made it extremely difficult to mine. Plasma torches were virtually useless; it would take days to burn away even a small section of cortosis-laced rock. The only effective way to mine it was through the brute force of hydraulic jacks pounding relentlessly away at a vein, chipping the cortosis free bit by bit.<br><br> Cortosis was one of the hardest materials in the galaxy. The force of the pounding quickly wore down the head of a jack, blunting it until it became almost useless. The dust clogged the hydraulic pistons, making them jam. Mining cortosis was hard on the equipment . . . and even harder on the miners.<br><br> Des had been hammering away for nearly six standard hours. The jack weighed more than thirty kilos, and the strain of keeping it raised and pressed against the rock face was taking its toll. His arms were trembling from the exertion. His lungs were gasping for air and choking on the clouds of fine mineral dust thrown up from the jack&#x2019;s head. Even his teeth hurt: the rattling vibration felt as if it were shaking them loose from his gums.<br><br> But the miners on Apatros were paid based on how much cortosis they brought back. If he quit now, another miner would jump in and start working the vein, taking a share of the profits. Des didn&#x2019;t like to share.<br><br> The whine of the jack&#x2019;s motor took on a higher pitch, becoming a keening wail Des was all too familiar with. At twenty thousand rpm, the motor sucked in dust like a thirsty bantha sucking up water after a long desert crossing. The only way to combat it was by regular cleaning and servicing, and the Outer Rim Oreworks Company preferred to buy cheap equipment and replace it, rather than sinking credits into maintenance. Des knew exactly what was going to happen next&#x2014;and a second later, it did. The motor blew.<br><br> The hydraulics seized with a horrible crunch, and a cloud of black smoke spit out the rear of the jack. Cursing ORO and its corporate policies, Des released his cramped finger from the trigger and tossed the spent piece of equipment to the floor.<br><br> &#x201c;Move aside, kid,&#x201d; a voice said.<br><br> Gerd, one of the other miners, stepped up and tried to shoulder Des out of the way so he could work the vein with his own jack. Gerd had been working the mines for nearly twenty standard years, and it had turned his body into a mass of hard, knotted muscle. But Des had been working the mines for ten years himself, ever since he was a teenager, and he was just as solid as the older man&#x2014;and a little bigger. He didn&#x2019;t budge.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not done here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Jack died, that&#x2019;s all. Hand me yours and I&#x2019;ll keep at it for a while.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You know the rules, kid. You stop working and someone else is allowed to move in.&#x201d;<br><br> Technically, Gerd was right. But nobody ever jumped another miner&#x2019;s claim over an equipment malfunction. Not unless he was trying to pick a fight.<br><br> Des took a quick look around. The chamber was empty except for the two of them, standing less than half a meter apart. Not a surprise; Des usually chose caverns far off the main tunnel network. It had to be more than mere coincidence that Gerd was here.<br><br> Des had known Gerd for as long as he could remember. The middle-aged man had been friends with Hurst, Des&#x2019;s father. Back when Des first started working the mines at thirteen, he had taken a lot of abuse from the bigger miners. His father had been the worst tormentor, but Gerd had been one of the main instigators, dishing out more than his fair share of teasing, insults, and the occasional cuff on the ear.<br><br> Their harassments had ended shortly after Des&#x2019;s father died of a massive heart attack. It wasn&#x2019;t because the miners felt sorry for the orphaned young man, though. By the time Hurst died, the tall, skinny teenager they loved to bully had become a mountain of muscle with heavy hands and a fierce temper. Mining was a tough job; it was the closest thing to hard labor outside a Republic prison colony. Whoever worked the mines on Apatros got big&#x2014;and Des just happened to become the biggest of them all. Half a dozen black eyes, countless bloody noses, and one broken jaw in the space of a month was all it took for Hurst&#x2019;s old friends to decide they&#x2019;d be happier if they left Des alone.<br><br> Yet it was almost as if they blamed him for Hurst&#x2019;s death, and every few months one of them tried again. Gerd had always been smart enough to keep his distance&#x2014;until now.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any of your friends here with you, old man,&#x201d; Des said. &#x201c;So back off my claim, and nobody gets hurt.&#x201d;<br><br> Gerd spat on the ground at Des&#x2019;s feet. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even know what day it is, do you, boy? Kriffing disgrace is what you are!&#x201d;<br><br> They were standing close enough to each other that Des could smell the sour Corellian whiskey on Gerd&#x2019;s breath. The man was drunk. Drunk enough to come looking for a fight, but still sober enough to hold his own.<br><br> &#x201c;Five years ago today,&#x201d; Gerd said, shaking his head sadly. &#x201c;Five years ago today your own father died, and you don&#x2019;t even remember!&#x201d;<br><br> Des rarely even thought about his father anymore. He hadn&#x2019;t been sorry to see him go. His earliest memories were of his father smacking him. He didn&#x2019;t even remember the reason; Hurst rarely needed one.<br><br> &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t say I miss Hurst the same way you do, Gerd.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hurst?&#x201d; Gerd snorted. &#x201c;He raised you by himself after your mama died, and you don&#x2019;t even have the respect to call him Dad? You ungrateful son-of-a-Kath-hound!&#x201d;<br><br> Des glared down menacingly at Gerd, but the shorter man was too full of drink and self-righteous indignation to be intimidated.<br><br> &#x201c;Should&#x2019;ve expected this from a mudcrutch whelp like you,&#x201d; Gerd continued. &#x201c;Hurst always said you were no good. He knew there was something wrong with you . . . Bane.&#x201d;<br><br> Des narrowed his eyes, but didn&#x2019;t rise to the bait. Hurst had called him by that name when he was drunk. Bane. He had blamed his son for his wife&#x2019;s death. Blamed him for being stuck on Apatros. He considered his only child to be the bane of his existence, a fact he&#x2019;d tended to spit out at Des in his drunken rages.<br><br> Bane. It represented everything spiteful, petty, and mean about his father. It struck at the innermost fears of every child: fear of disappointment, fear of abandonment, fear of violence. As a kid, that name had hurt more than all the smacks from his father&#x2019;s heavy fists. But Des wasn&#x2019;t a kid anymore. Over time he&#x2019;d learned to ignore it, along with all the rest of the hateful bile that spilled from his father&#x2019;s mouth.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time for this,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got work to do.&#x201d;<br><br> With one hand he grabbed the hydraulic jack from Gerd&#x2019;s grasp. He put the other hand on Gerd&#x2019;s shoulder and shoved him away. Stumbling back, the inebriated man caught his heel on a rock and fell roughly to the ground.<br><br> He stood up with a snarl, his hands balling into fists. &#x201c;Guess your daddy&#x2019;s been gone too long, boy. You need someone to beat the sense back into you!&#x201d;<br><br> Gerd was drunk, but he was no fool, Des realized. Des was bigger, stronger, younger . . . but he&#x2019;d spent the last six hours working a hydraulic jack. He was covered in grime and the sweat was dripping off his face. His shirt was drenched. Gerd&#x2019;s uniform, on the other hand, was still relatively clean: no dust, no sweat stains. He must have been planning this all day, taking it easy and sitting back while Des wore himself out.<br><br> But Des wasn&#x2019;t about to back down from a fight. Throwing Gerd&#x2019;s jack to the ground, he dropped into a crouch, feet wide and arms held out in front of him.<br><br> Gerd charged forward, swinging his right fist in a vicious uppercut. Des reached out and caught the punch with the open palm of his left hand, absorbing the force of the blow. His right hand snapped forward and grabbed the underside of Gerd&#x2019;s right wrist; as he pulled the older man forward, Des ducked down and turned, driving his shoulder into Gerd&#x2019;s chest. Using his opponent&#x2019;s own momentum against him, Des straightened up and yanked hard on Gerd&#x2019;s wrist, flipping him up and over so that he crashed to the ground on his back.<br><br> The fight should have ended right then; Des had a split second where he could have dropped his knee onto his opponent, driving the breath from his lungs and pinning him to the ground while he pounded Gerd with his fists. But it didn&#x2019;t happen. His back, exhausted from hours of hefting the thirty-kilo jack, spasmed.<br><br> The pain was agonizing; instinctively Des straightened up, clutching at the knotted lumbar muscles.

The Tantric tradition is a unique collection of lesser-known texts, concepts, and meditation practices that are usually made available only to experienced and specially initiated practitioners. <br><br>The "Vajra World" ( <i>vajradhatu</i> in Sanskrit) is a realm of indestructibility, the level of reality beyond all thought and imagination, all impermanence and change, which a fully realized person knows and inhabits. Used metaphorically, "Vajra World" refers to the traditional culture of Tibet and the unique spirituality that is its secret strength.<br>Topics include: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The tantric view of human nature and the external world <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The special role of the guru, or tantric mentor <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The preliminary practices that prepare the student for full initiation <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The major dimensions of Vajrayana practice, including visualizations, liturgies, and inner yogas <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The tradition of the <i>tulku</i>, or incarnate lama <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The lore surrounding the death of ordinary people and of saints <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The practice of solitary retreat, the epitome of traditional Tibetan Buddhism<br> <i>Secret of the Vajra World </i> is the companion volume to the author's earlier book, <i>Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism. </i> While that book focuses on the history, cosmology, philosophy, and practice of the more public, exoteric side of Tibetan Buddhism, this work treats its more hidden and esoteric aspects as they take shape in Vajrayana. Together, the two volumes provide a broad introduction to the major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism.</p><p>Move over, Robert Thurman--Tibetan Buddhism has a new secular prophet. Learned, articulate, and devoted to his subject, Reginald Ray writes about Tibetan Buddhism as an insider and as a teacher who gets his point across quickly and clearly, without dross or hyperbole. Following the success of <i>Indestructible Truth</i>, his general introduction to the history, sects, and forms of Tibetan Buddhism, Ray now tackles the more subtle and esoteric side of <i>vajra</i>, or indestructibility. Divided into four parts, the first section sets the historical stage. In the second, we enter the unique universe of tantra--the limitations of thought, the use of mandalas, the devotion to a teacher. Here Ray also introduces practice with personal deities and the inner yogas that explore the "subtle, energetic dimensions of the body." Part 3 is devoted the twin pinnacles of Tibetan Buddhism, <i>mahamudra</i> and <i>dzogchen</i>, which ultimately both teach the complete ordinariness of enlightened existence. In Part 4, Ray explains a variety of practices related to dying, incarnate lamas, and the retreat. Throughout, the reader gets the sense that Ray is a teacher with the priceless ability to transmit his vast knowledge to outsiders. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Reginald A.

Lewis</h2><p><p>The White Witch, Aslan, fauns and talking beasts, centaurs and epic battles between good and evil -- all these have become a part of our collective imagination through the classic volumes of <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>. Over the past half century, children everywhere have escaped into this world and delighted in its wonders and enchantments. Yet what we do know of the man who created Narnia? This biography sheds new light on the making of the original Narnian, C. S. Lewis himself.</p><p>Lewis was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century and arguably the most influential religious writer of his day. An Oxford don and scholar of medieval literature, he loved to debate philosophy at his local pub, and his wartime broadcasts on the basics of Christian belief made him a celebrity in his native Britain. Yet one of the most intriguing aspects of Clive Staples Lewis remains a mystery. How did this middle-aged Irish bachelor turn to the writing of stories for children -- stories that would become among the most popular and beloved ever written?</p><p>Alan Jacobs masterfully tells the story of the original Narnian. From Lewis's childhood days in Ireland playing with his brother, Warnie, to his horrific experiences in the trenches during World War I, to his friendship with J. R. R. Tolkien (and other members of the "Inklings"), and his remarkable late-life marriage to Joy Davidman, Jacobs traces the events and people that shaped Lewis's philosophy, theology, and fiction. The result is much more than a conventional biography of Lewis: Jacobs tells the story of a profound and extraordinary imagination. For those who grew up with Narnia, or for those just discovering it, <em>The Narnian</em> tells a remarkable tale of a man who knew great loss and great delight, but who knew above all that the world holds far more richness and meaning than the average eye can see.</p></p><p>C. S. Lewis was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century and arguably the most influential Christian writer of his day. Yet among his poetry, literary history and criticism, novels and Christian apologetics stands a unique, delightfully imaginative children&#x2019;s series called The Chronicles of Narnia, which have become enduring classics. Alan Jacobs takes this imaginary world of Narnia, that has captivated children and adults alike for years, and uses the themes and stories found within to explore the imaginative life of C. S. Lewis. Few things are more interesting to human beings than trying to figure out how another human being (especially a profoundly gifted one) works. Not just a conventional, straightforward biography of Lewis, Jacobs instead seeks a more elusive quarry: an understanding of the way Lewis&#x2019;s experiences, both direct and literary, formed themselves into patterns--themes that then shaped his thought and writings, especially the stories of Narnia. It is in the Narnia stories that we see the most of Lewis, and this illuminating biography delivers a true picture of the life and imagination of the Narnian.<p>Alan Jacobs is professor of English at Wheaton College in Illinois. He is the author of several books, including most recently <em>The Narnian</em>, a biography of C. S. Lewis. His literary and cultural criticism has appeared in a wide range of periodicals, including the <em>Boston Globe</em>, <em>The American Scholar</em>, <em>First Things</em>, <em>Books &amp; Culture</em>, and <em>The Oxford American</em>.</p></p><h2>Master the Matrix: 7 Essentials for Getting Things Done in Complex Organizations</h2><p><i><b>Winner of a 2018 Notable Indie from Shelf Unbound for one of the best independently published books of the year!</b></i><i><b></b></i><i><b></b></i>You're in a matrix, whether you realize it or not. The test: Do you have multiple bosses? Do you depend on a variety of resources throughout the organization to get your tasks done, and do these resources report into other people or teams? If you answered ''yes'' to either, you're in a matrix role.<br>Matrix organizations and matrix roles are everywhere. The field customer contact person who writes contracts, negotiates delivery and troubleshoots product issues is in a matrix role. So is the product manager simultaneously accountable for numbers in her country, region and business unit despite the fact they are in conflict, or the HR person who reports both to a globalized function and the head of the business they support. All of these roles require matrix management, or as this book describes, "matrix mastery."<i></i><br><i>Master the Matrix: 7 Essentials for Getting Things Done in Complex Organizations </i>is based on the experiences and ideas of over 100 matrix practitioners, combined into seven matrix essentials:&nbsp; Start with Partnerships, Get Goals Aligned, Clarify Roles, Get Decisions Made, Flex Your Influence Muscle (Influence without authority), Communicate without Assumption and Make Meetings Matter.&nbsp; These seven essentials can push you past matrix management and toward matrix <i>mastery</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>From the book's Foreword Author, Harry M.

And getting things done is really what it's all about. At the end of the day--have you made a difference? Have you moved the organization forward? Do you feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in your work?"</p><p>In my 20+ years working and consulting in complex (sometimes called "matrix" organizations) I've stumbled and I have seen others get tangled up in the complexity. Really bright, talented people can get tripped up trying to figure out who does what, trying to prioritize, just trying to <i>get things done.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> What I hadn't seen in my career were solutions--so what do we do about all this complexity, besides lament?&nbsp; One of the major drivers behind writing the book was this<i>: It is time to change the conversation. </i>Too much talk about the organizational matrix involves complaints and criticism. The 7 Essentials provide a framework and language for discussing the matrix constructively. Whether it is describing man-made versus natural goal misalignments or role clarity versus role acceptance, talking about issues in a constructive and objective way moves us forward and closer to getting things done.<br> &nbsp;<br> My hope is that this books helps people gain traction and reap the benefit of that traction, which is feeling more satisfied in their career.&nbsp; The complexity isn't going away--as a matter of fact, learning to work with it will be your competitive advantage.&nbsp;<b>Susan Finerty</b> has been working in matrix roles and with matrix organizations for more than 20 years.

This book clearly shows how God has been speaking to America for decades through a variety of prophetic voices who have been alerting the nation to its sins and calling it to repentance. It also demonstrates how the nation has turned a deaf ear to these messages and to the remedial judgments God has sent. This of course, raises the crucial question: Is there any hope for America? The answer to that question which this book supplies is sobering. It will impel you into the Scriptures and to your knees in prayer. Past Prophetic Voices include: Peter Marshall, David Wilkerson, Francis Schaeffer, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Current Prophetic Voices include: Donald Wildmon, Erwin Lutzer, David Jeremiah, William Koenig, Jan Markell, Albert Mohler, Franklin Graham, Robert Jeffress and Jonathan Cahn.</p><p>Dr. David R.

Pawel Tarnowski, a bookseller, gives refuge to David Sch�fer, a Jewish youth who has escaped from the ghetto, and hides him in the attic of the book shop. Throughout the winter of 1942-43, haunted by the looming threat of discovery, they discuss good and evil, sin and redemption, literature and philosophy, and their respective religious views of reality. Decades later, David becomes a convert to Catholicism, is the Carmelite priest Fr. Elijah Sch�fer called by the Pope to confront the Anti-christ in Michael O'Brien's best-selling novel,&nbsp;<em>Father Elijah: an Apocalypse.</em></p><p></p><p></p><p>In this "prequel", the author explores the meaning of love, religious identity, and sacrifice viewed from two distinct perspectives. The cast of characters also includes the notorious Count Smokrev, a literate Nazi Major, a French novelist, a terrifying Polish bear, the Russian icon painter Andrei Rublev, and Pawel's beloved Kahlia, the elusive figure who moves through the story as an unseen presence. As the story unfolds, the loss of spiritual fatherhood in late Western society is revealed as a problem of language in the heart and soul, and as one of the gravest crises of our times. As the author points the way to rediscovery of our Father in heaven, he also shows us the path to renewal of human fatherhood.

The authors, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras, spent six years in research, and they freely admit that their own preconceptions about business success were devastated by their actual findings--along with the preconceptions of virtually everyone else.<p> <i>Built to Last</i> identifies 18 "visionary" companies and sets out to determine what's special about them. To get on the list, a company had to be world famous, have a stellar brand image, and be at least 50 years old. We're talking about companies that even a layperson knows to be, well, different: the Disneys, the Wal-Marts, the Mercks. </p><p> Whatever the key to the success of these companies, the key to the success of this book is that the authors don't waste time comparing them to business failures. Instead, they use a control group of "successful-but-second-rank" companies to highlight what's special about their 18 "visionary" picks. Thus Disney is compared to Columbia Pictures, Ford to GM, Hewlett Packard to Texas Instruments, and so on.</p><p> The core myth, according to the authors, is that visionary companies must start with a great product and be pushed into the future by charismatic leaders. There are examples of that pattern, they admit: Johnson &amp; Johnson, for one. But there are also just too many counterexamples--in fact, the majority of the "visionary" companies, including giants like 3M, Sony, and TI, don't fit the model. They were characterized by total lack of an initial business plan or key idea and by remarkably self-effacing leaders. Collins and Porras are much more impressed with something else they shared: an almost cult-like devotion to a "core ideology" or identity, and active indoctrination of employees into "ideologically commitment" to the company. </p><p> The comparison with the business "B"-team does tend to raise a significant methodological problem: which companies are to be counted as "visionary" in the first place? There's an air of circularity here, as if you achieve "visionary" status by ... achieving visionary status. So many roads lead to Rome that the book is less practical than it might appear. But that's exactly the point of an eloquent chapter on 3M. This wildly successful company had no master plan, little structure, and no prima donnas. Instead it had an atmosphere in which bright people were both keen to see the company succeed and unafraid to "try a lot of stuff and keep what works." <i>--Richard Farr</i></p>James C.

Matthias joins Alexander&#x2019;s army after it has conquered the Persian empire and is advancing east into Afghanistan on its way to the riches of India. Part of a unit that includes recruits his own age as well as veterans, Matthias chronicles his rapid coming-of-age as a soldier as he enacts Alexander&#x2019;s scorch-and-burn strategies, experiences the joys and sorrows of a romance with an Afghan girl, and faces the barbarism of the Afghans, his fellow soldiers, and ultimately himself. As Matthias relates the brutal day-to-day encounters between the two sides, he exposes the human cost borne by a company of men whose code is humanist and secular when they seek to impose their will on a people of deep religiosity, insularity, unbending pride, and a passionate readiness to die for their cause. <br><br>An edge-of-your-seat adventure that brings to life the confrontation between an invading Western army and fierce Eastern warriors determined at all costs to defend their homeland, <i>The Afghan Campaign</i> once again demonstrates Steven Pressfield&#x2019;s profound understanding of the hopes and desperation of men in battle and of the historical realities that continue to influence our world.</p><p>steven pressfield is the author of the historical novels <i>Gates of Fire,</i> <i>The Virtues of War</i>, <i>Tides of War</i>, and <i>Last of the Amazons</i>. He lives in Los Angeles, California.1.<br><br>I am the third and last son of my family to come out to Afghanistan. My older brothers went out as cavalrymen. I signed with the infantry.<br><br>The distinction between horse and foot is not so great in Afghanistan as it was in Alexander's earlier campaigns in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Persia. Out east, an infantryman is expected to leap onto the back of any creature that will bear his weight--horse, mule, ass, or <i>yaboo</i> (the Afghan pony)--and ride to the site of action, there to dismount and fight, or even fight from the beast's back if necessary. Likewise horse troopers, even the King's Companions, think nothing of hitting the ground and slugging it out on foot alongside the dirt-eaters.<br><br>My father was killed in Afghanistan, or more precisely he expired of sepsis in a military hospital in Susia, in the province of Areia, which lies on the western border of the country. My father was not a mounted warrior or a foot soldier but a combat engineer of the siege train--what the troops call a "bucket man" because miners and sappers dig their trenches and raise their earthworks with wicker baskets. His name was the same as mine, Matthias.<br><br>My father fought at the Granicus River, at Tyre, Gaza, and at Issus. He was an authentic hero. My brothers are too. Once, when I was sixteen, my father sent home an army warrant worth a quarter talent of gold. We bought a second farm with it, with two barns and a year-round creek, and had enough left over to fence the place in stone.<br><br>It was my father's keenest wish that I, the youngest brother, not come out to war. My mother, further, was violently opposed to any step that would take me away from the land. "You may call it your misfortune, Matthias," she declared, "to have been whelped last of the litter. But, like it or not, you are my bulwark and the bulwark of this farm. Your father is gone. We shall never see your brothers again. Lust for glory will be their finish; they will leave great names and nothing more."<br><br>My mother feared that I, gone overseas, would tread into the snare of some foreign wench and, taking her to wife, never return to Macedon.<br><br>I was eighteen, however, and as mad for glory as every other overheated young blood in a kingdom whose twenty-five-year-old sovereign, Alexander son of Philip, had in only four years sacked earth's mightiest empire and turned our homeland delirious with conquest, fame, and treasure.<br><br>In the Macedonian army, enlistments are measured not by years but by cycles, or "bumps." A bump is eighteen months. Minimum enlistment is two bumps, one to be trained and one to serve, but a man must commit for a third cycle, a total of four and a half years, if and when he is called overseas. It worked this way: A recruit entered service with a regiment of the Occupation Army. This was the force left behind by Alexander to hold down Greece and the tribal north. All these contingents were territorial; you had to come from the district or you couldn't get in. As Alexander's needs in Asia necessitated, he sent home for replacements. Sometimes entire regiments were called up; other times individuals, either those in specific military specialties such as intelligence or siege engineering, or simply infantrymen with seniority whose lucky number came up.<br><br>All this was moot for a youth of my district, Apollonia. Apollonia has no infantry regiment. The region is cavalry country. The most famous squadron of Alexander's Companions, the ile of Socrates Sathon, comes from Apollonia. This squadron, in which both my brothers served, led the charge at the battle of the Granicus River; it fought at Alexander's right hand in the great victories of Issus and Gaugamela. It has more hero statues at Dium than any other squadron, including the Royal. My best friend Lucas and I, and every other war-crazed youth in the territory, had trained year-round since before we could walk, on fire for the day we would enter the trials and with heaven's aid become, like Apollonia's heroes before us, King's Companions.<br><br>We were too late, Lucas and I. By the time our hour came, Alexander's army had pushed so deep into Asia and had assimilated troops from so many vanquished nations that our king no longer sent home for Companion cavalry, except to replace men killed, wounded, or retired. The horse troops he employed now were all hired squadrons--Persians mostly, with Syrians, Lydians, Cappadocians, and riders of other kingdoms of the conquered East. No Mack could join these, even if he could get overseas, which he couldn't, or could speak the barbarian tongue, which he wouldn't.<br><br>There was only one way for Lucas and me to get out to Asia. As hired infantry. As mercenaries.<br><br>At that time, scores of private contractors--called pilophoroi for the felt caps they wore--traveled the cities of Greece and Asia Minor, signing up troops. It was a business. Candidates paid a fee, called a "pony" because it was so steep a man could buy a fine colt with it. The felt-caps got them in.<br><br>Turning eighteen, Lucas and I trekked three days to the port of Methone, the hiring depot for mercenary infantry. The taverns were crawling with grizzled professionals--Arcadians and Syracusans, Cretans and Rhodians, even officers of the Achaeans and Spartans. They all knew each other from prior hitches; they had mates and commanders who could get them aboard. Lucas and I were the youngest by years. We knew nobody. No pilophoros would touch us, no matter how convincingly we lied about our age or our service histories (of which we had none).<br><br>We stayed ten days, with our payoff cash dwindling rapidly, trying to talk or buy our way in anywhere. At the last hour we went seeking the recruiting general himself. Of course we couldn't get near him. A Line Sergeant from Pella kicked us out. "Wait a minute," he said, hearing our accents. "Are you boys from Apollonia?"<br><br>He wanted to know if we could ride.<br><br>We were centaurs!<br><br>The sergeant drew up our papers on the spot and wouldn't take any money either. He put us down as Mounted Infantry. That was what Alexander needed most. Lucas and I could not believe our luck. We asked what outfit we'd be with and when we'd get our horses.<br><br>"No outfits," the sergeant said. "And no horses neither." He had put us on the rolls because we were Macedonians, amid all these foreigners. "No overseas captain ever turned down a lad from home."<br><br>We thanked him with all our hearts. He brushed it off. "Don't worry about what outfit you ship out with, or if you never see an hour of drill. Out east," he said, "the king'll draft you wherever he needs you."<br>2.<br>Our force of replacements landed at Tripolis in Syria on the sixteenth of Daesius, early summer, in the sixth year of Alexander's reign, the fourth since the expeditionary force had crossed out of Europe into Asia. The king and his army were then a thousand miles east, on their way from Persepolis, Persia's capital, to Ecbatana in Media, the summer palace of her kings. The Persian Empire had fallen; Alexander now pursued its fugitive king. Our lord's pack train, reports said, was seven thousand camels and ten thousand pairs of asses, all laden with gold.<br><br>Our detachment of replacements was sixty-one hundred in forty-seven ships. The harbor at Tripolis couldn't hold that many, and, as the vessels had neither berths nor provisions to lie-to overnight in the roads, a conference was held of the captains, who were just merchant skippers hired for pay, at which it was decided that our ferry (which is what it was) and about ten others would be rowed to shallow water, where we scuffs were told to grab our kit, hop over the side, and swim for it. Which we did. It was a grand lark, except that I ruined a fine pair of boots in the saltwater, growing too weary to hold them over my head. This is how I landed in Asia, soaked as a drowned cat, and barefoot.<br><br>Replacements are not an army. Our mob had been formed not into regiments but into "S.C.'s," shipboard contingents, and did not, when we landed, even have our arms. The cavalry didn't have its horses. The animals were following in other transports. There was a tent city waiting, and an escort of six hundred Syrian mercenaries, and fourteen hundred hired infantry of Lycia, with Macedonian officers, who were to take us up to Marathus and from there by way of Larissa to Thapsacus, where we would cross the Euphrates into Mesopotamian Syria and Kurdistan. The march to catch up with Alexander would take between three and four months.<br><br>As always in a new camp, the troops plunged at once into their favored pastimes--touring the site looking up friends, and poaching every item of kit they could lay hands on. You couldn't set down a heel of bread without somebody snatching it, and a decent hat or a pair of road-slappers were sure goners. A man hung his purse next to his testicles and, after shaking hands with a stranger, checked to make sure both sacks were still where he had left them.<br><br>In Alexander's fighting army, every trooper knew the mark he was to stand on. But here, a thousand miles to the rear, the show was all orphan stew. You ate when the cooks opened the tents and bunked where you could find a patch of dirt wide enough to hold your bones. You kept with your mates to keep the scroungers from picking you blind. My bunch was Lucas; Terres, called "Rags" for his dandy's love of clothes; and Peithon, undersized, called "Flea." We were all from Apollonia, all eighteen, and had known each other all our lives.<br><br>Lucas was our leader. He was a born operator and set out to keep our heads above the general ruck. We were supposed to get paid on landing at Tripolis (it'd been a month, marshaling and crossing), but if there was any shine with this mob, I never saw it. In fact we had to pay, ourselves. The slugs at the cook-tent wanted cash to get in. You had to pay to take a crap.<br><br>"We've got to find ourselves a bull," pronounce...</p><h2>Enrique&#39;s Journey: The Story of a Boy&#39;s Dangerous Odyssey to Reunite with His Mother</h2><p>In this astonishing true story, award-winning journalist Sonia Nazario recounts the unforgettable odyssey of a Honduran boy who braves unimaginable hardship and peril to reach his mother in the United States.<br><br> When Enrique is five years old, his mother, Lourdes, too poor to feed her children, leaves Honduras to work in the United States. The move allows her to send money back home to Enrique so he can eat better and go to school past the third grade.<br> <br>Lourdes promises Enrique she will return quickly. But she struggles in America. Years pass. He begs for his mother to come back. Without her, he becomes lonely and troubled. When she calls, Lourdes tells him to be patient. Enrique despairs of ever seeing her again. After eleven years apart, he decides he will go find her.<br> <br>Enrique sets off alone from Tegucigalpa, with little more than a slip of paper bearing his mother&#x2019;s North Carolina telephone number. Without money, he will make the dangerous and illegal trek up the length of Mexico the only way he can&#x2013;clinging to the sides and tops of freight trains.<br> <br>With gritty determination and a deep longing to be by his mother&#x2019;s side, Enrique travels through hostile, unknown worlds. Each step of the way through Mexico, he and other migrants, many of them children, are hunted like animals. Gangsters control the tops of the trains. Bandits rob and kill migrants up and down the tracks. Corrupt cops all along the route are out to fleece and deport them. To evade Mexican police and immigration authorities, they must jump onto and off the moving boxcars they call El Tren de la Muerte&#x2014;The Train of Death. Enrique pushes forward using his wit, courage, and hope&#x2013;and the kindness of strangers. It is an epic journey, one thousands of immigrant children make each year to find their mothers in the United States.<br> <br>Based on the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> newspaper series that won two Pulitzer Prizes, one for feature writing and another for feature photography, <i>Enrique&#x2019;s Journey</i> is the timeless story of families torn apart, the yearning to be together again, and a boy who will risk his life to find the mother he loves.<b><br> </b><br><b>Praise for <i>Enrique&#x2019;s Journey</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Magnificent . . . <i>Enrique&#x2019;s Journey</i> is about love.

She will not even look at<br>him. Enrique has no hint of what she is going to do.<br>Lourdes knows. She understands, as only a mother can, the<br>terror she is about to inflict, the ache Enrique will feel, and finally<br>the emptiness.<br><br>What will become of him? Already he will not let anyone<br>else feed or bathe him. He loves her deeply, as only a son can.<br>With Lourdes, he is openly affectionate. &#x201c;<i>Dame pico, mami. </i>Give<br>me a kiss, Mom,&#x201d; he pleads, over and over, pursing his lips.<br>With Lourdes, he is a chatterbox. &#x201c;<i>Mira, mami. </i>Look, Mom,&#x201d; he<br>says softly, asking her questions about everything he sees. Without<br>her, he is so shy it is crushing.<br><br>Slowly, she walks out onto the porch. Enrique clings to her<br>pant leg. Beside her, he is tiny. Lourdes loves him so much she<br>cannot bring herself to say a word. She cannot carry his picture.<br>It would melt her resolve. She cannot hug him. He is five<br>years old.<br><br>They live on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa, in Honduras.<br>She can barely afford food for him and his sister, Belky, who is<br>seven. She&#x2019;s never been able to buy them a toy or a birthday<br>cake. Lourdes, twenty-four, scrubs other people&#x2019;s laundry in a<br>muddy river. She goes door to door, selling tortillas, used<br>clothes, and plantains.<br><br>She fills a wooden box with gum and crackers and cigarettes,<br>and she finds a spot where she can squat on a dusty sidewalk<br>next to the downtown Pizza Hut and sell the items to<br>passersby. The sidewalk is Enrique&#x2019;s playground.<br>They have a bleak future. He and Belky are not likely to finish<br>grade school. Lourdes cannot afford uniforms or pencils.<br>Her husband is gone. A good job is out of the question.<br>Lourdes knows of only one place that offers hope. As a<br>seven-year-old child, delivering tortillas her mother made to<br>wealthy homes, she glimpsed this place on other people&#x2019;s television<br>screens. The flickering images were a far cry from Lourdes&#x2019;s<br>childhood home: a two-room shack made of wooden slats,<br>its flimsy tin roof weighted down with rocks, the only bathroom<br>a clump of bushes outside. On television, she saw New York<br>City&#x2019;s spectacular skyline, Las Vegas&#x2019;s shimmering lights, Disneyland&#x2019;s<br>magic castle.<br><br>Lourdes has decided: She will leave. She will go to the<br>United States and make money and send it home. She will be<br>gone for one year&#x2014;less, with luck&#x2014;or she will bring her children<br>to be with her.

Virtually unnoticed,<br>he will become one of an estimated 48,000 children who enter<br>the United States from Central America and Mexico each year,<br>illegally and without either of their parents. Roughly two thirds<br>of them will make it past the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization<br>Service.<br><br>Many go north seeking work. Others flee abusive families.<br>Most of the Central Americans go to reunite with a parent, say<br>counselors at a detention center in Texas where the INS houses<br>the largest number of the unaccompanied children it catches.<br>Of those, the counselors say, 75 percent are looking for their<br>mothers. Some children say they need to find out whether their<br>mothers still love them. A priest at a Texas shelter says they<br>often bring pictures of themselves in their mothers&#x2019; arms.<br>The journey is hard for the Mexicans but harder still for<br>Enrique and the others from Central America. They must<br>make an illegal and dangerous trek up the length of Mexico.<br>Counselors and immigration lawyers say only half of them get<br>help from smugglers. The rest travel alone. They are cold, hungry,<br>and helpless. They are hunted like animals by corrupt police, bandits, and gang members deported from the United<br>States. A University of Houston study found that most are<br>robbed, beaten, or raped, usually several times. Some are<br>killed.<br><br>They set out with little or no money. Thousands, shelter<br>workers say, make their way through Mexico clinging to the<br>sides and tops of freight trains. Since the 1990s, Mexico and<br>the United States have tried to thwart them. To evade Mexican<br>police and immigration authorities, the children jump onto and<br>off of the moving train cars. Sometimes they fall, and the wheels<br>tear them apart.<br><br>They navigate by word of mouth or by the arc of the sun.<br>Often, they don&#x2019;t know where or when they&#x2019;ll get their next<br>meal. Some go days without eating. If a train stops even briefly,<br>they crouch by the tracks, cup their hands, and steal sips of<br>water from shiny puddles tainted with diesel fuel. At night, they<br>huddle together on the train cars or next to the tracks. They<br>sleep in trees, in tall grass, or in beds made of leaves.<br>Some are very young. Mexican rail workers have encountered<br>seven-year-olds on their way to find their mothers. A policeman<br>discovered a nine-year-old boy near the downtown Los<br>Angeles tracks. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for my mother,&#x201d; he said. The<br>youngster had left Puerto Cortes in Honduras three months before.<br>He had been guided only by his cunning and the single<br>thing he knew about her: where she lived. He had asked everyone,<br>&#x201c;How do I get to San Francisco?&#x201d;<br><br>Typically, the children are teenagers. Some were babies<br>when their mothers left; they know them only by pictures sent<br>home. Others, a bit older, struggle to hold on to memories: One<br>has slept in her mother&#x2019;s bed; another has smelled her perfume,<br>put on her deodorant, her clothes. One is old enough to re-<br>member his mother&#x2019;s face, another her laugh, her favorite<br>shade of lipstick, how her dress felt as she stood at the stove patting<br>tortillas.<br><br>Many, including Enrique, begin to idealize their mothers.<br>They remember how their mothers fed and bathed them, how<br>they walked them to kindergarten. In their absence, these mothers<br>become larger than life. Although in the United States the<br>women struggle to pay rent and eat, in the imaginations of<br>their children back home they become deliverance itself, the<br>answer to every problem. Finding them becomes the quest for<br>the Holy Grail.<br><br>CONFUSION<br>Enrique is bewildered. Who will take care of him now that his<br>mother is gone? Lourdes, unable to burden her family with<br>both of her children, has split them up. Belky stayed with Lourdes&#x2019;s<br>mother and sisters. For two years, Enrique is entrusted to<br>his father, Luis, from whom his mother has been separated for<br>three years.<br><br>Enrique clings to his daddy, who dotes on him. A bricklayer,<br>his father takes Enrique to work and lets him help mix mortar.<br>They live with Enrique&#x2019;s grandmother. His father shares a bed<br>with him and brings him apples and clothes. Every month, Enrique<br>misses his mother less, but he does not forget her. &#x201c;When<br>is she coming for me?&#x201d; he asks.<br><br>Lourdes and her smuggler cross Mexico on buses. Each afternoon,<br>she closes her eyes. She imagines herself home at<br>dusk, playing with Enrique under a eucalyptus tree in her<br>mother&#x2019;s front yard. Enrique straddles a broom, pretending it&#x2019;s<br>a donkey, trotting around the muddy yard. Each afternoon, she<br>presses her eyes shut and tears fall. Each afternoon, she reminds<br>herself that if she is weak, if she does not keep moving<br>forward, her children will pay.<br><br>Lourdes crosses into the United States in one of the largest<br>immigrant waves in the country&#x2019;s history. She enters at night<br>through a rat-infested Tijuana sewage tunnel and makes her<br>way to Los Angeles. There, in the downtown Greyhound bus<br>terminal, the smuggler tells Lourdes to wait while he runs a<br>quick errand. He&#x2019;ll be right back. The smuggler has been paid<br>to take her all the way to Miami.<br><br>Three days pass. Lourdes musses her filthy hair, trying to<br>blend in with the homeless and not get singled out by police.<br>She prays to God to put someone before her, to show her the<br>way. Whom can she reach out to for help? Starved, she starts<br>walking. East of downtown, Lourdes spots a small factory. On<br>the loading dock, under a gray tin roof, women sort red and<br>green tomatoes. She begs for work. As she puts tomatoes into<br>boxes, she hallucinates that she is slicing open a juicy one and<br>sprinkling it with salt. The boss pays her $14 for two hours&#x2019;<br>work. Lourdes&#x2019;s brother has a friend in Los Angeles who helps<br>Lourdes get a fake Social Security card and a job.<br>She moves in with a Beverly Hills couple to take care of<br>their three-year-old daughter. Their spacious home has carpet<br>on the floors and mahogany panels on the walls. Her employers<br>are kind. They pay her $125 a week. She gets nights and<br>weekends off. Maybe, Lourdes tells herself&#x2014;if she stays long<br>enough&#x2014;they will help her become legal.<br><br>Every morning as the couple leave for work, the little girl<br>cries for her mother. Lourdes feeds her breakfast and thinks of<br>Enrique and Belky. She asks herself: &#x201c;Do my children cry like<br>this? I&#x2019;m giving this girl food instead of feeding my own children.&#x201d;<br>To get the girl to eat, Lourdes pretends the spoon is an<br>airplane. But each time the spoon lands in the girl&#x2019;s mouth,<br>Lourdes is filled with sadness.<br><br>In the afternoon, after the girl comes home from prekindergarten<br>class, they thumb through picture books and play. The<br>girl, so close to Enrique&#x2019;s age, is a constant reminder of her son.<br>Many afternoons, Lourdes cannot contain her grief. She gives<br>the girl a toy and dashes into the kitchen. There, out of sight,<br>tears flow. After seven months, she cannot take it. She quits and<br>moves to a friend&#x2019;s place in Long Beach.<br><br>Boxes arrive in Tegucigalpa bearing clothes, shoes, toy cars,<br>a Robocop doll, a television. Lourdes writes: Do they like the<br>things she is sending? She tells Enrique to behave, to study<br>hard. She has hopes for him: graduation from high school, a<br>white-collar job, maybe as an engineer. She pictures her son<br>working in a crisp shirt and shiny shoes. She says she loves him.<br>Enrique asks about his mother. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be home soon,&#x201d; his<br>grandmother assures him. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. She&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d;<br><br>But his mother does not come. Her disappearance is incomprehensible.<br>Enrique&#x2019;s bewilderment turns to confusion<br>and then to adolescent anger.<br>When Enrique is seven, his father brings a woman home.<br>To her, Enrique is an economic burden. One morning, she<br>spills hot cocoa and burns him. His father throws her out. But<br>their separation is brief.<br>&#x201c;Mom,&#x201d; Enrique&#x2019;s father tells the grandmother, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t<br>think of anyone but that woman.&#x201d;<br><br>Enrique&#x2019;s father bathes, dresses, splashes on cologne, and<br>follows her. Enrique tags along and begs to stay with him. But<br>his father tells him to go back to his grandmother.<br>His father begins a new family. Enrique sees him rarely,<br>usually by chance. In time, Enrique&#x2019;s love turns to contempt.<br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t love me. He loves the children he has with his<br>wife,&#x201d; he tells Belky. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a dad.&#x201d;<br><br>His father notices. &#x201c;He looks at me as if he wasn&#x2019;t my son,<br>as if he wants to strangle me,&#x201d; he tells Enrique&#x2019;s grandmother.<br>Most of the blame, his father decides, belongs to Enrique&#x2019;s<br>mother. &#x201c;She is the one who promised to come back.&#x201d;<br>For Belky, their mother&#x2019;s disappearance is just as distressing.<br>She lives with Aunt Rosa Amalia, one of her mother&#x2019;s sisters.<br>On Mother&#x2019;s Day, Belky struggles through a celebration at<br>school. That night she cries quietly, alone in her room. Then<br>she scolds herself. She should thank her mother for leaving;<br>without the money she sends for books and uniforms, Belky<br>could not even attend school. She reminds herself of all the<br>other things her mother ships south: Reebok tennis shoes, black<br>sandals, the yellow bear and pink puppy stuffed toys on her<br>bed. She commiserates with a friend whose mother has also<br>left. They console each other. They know a girl whose mother<br>died of a heart attack. At least, they say, ours are alive.<br>But Rosa Amalia thinks the separation has caused deep<br>emotional problems. To her, it seems that Belky is struggling<br>with an unavoidable question: How can I be worth anything if<br>my mother left me?<br><br>&#x201c;There are days,&#x201d; Belky tells Aunt Rosa Amalia, &#x201c;when I<br>wake up and feel so alone.&#x201d; Belky is temperamental. Sometimes<br>she stops talking to everyone. When her mood turns dark,<br>her grandmother warns the other children in the house,<br>&#x201c;<i>�P�rtense bien porque la marea anda brava! </i>You better behave, because<br>the seas are choppy!&#x201d;<br><br>Confused by his mother&#x2019;s absence, Enrique turns to his<br>grandmother. Alone now, he and his father&#x2019;s elderly mother<br>share a shack thirty feet square. Mar�a Marcos built it herself of<br>wooden slats. Enrique can see daylight in the cracks. It has four<br>rooms, three without electricity. There is no running water.<br>Gutters carry rain off the patched tin roof into two barrels. A<br>trickle of cloudy white sewage runs past the front gate. On a<br>well-worn rock nearby, Enrique&#x2019;s grandmother washes musty<br>used clothing she sells door to door. Next to the rock is the latrine&#x2014;<br>a concrete hole. Beside it are buckets for bathing.<br>The shack is in Carrizal, one of Tegucigalpa&#x2019;s poorest<br>neighborhoods. Sometimes Enrique looks across the rolling<br>hills to the neighborhood where he and his mother lived and<br>where Belky still lives with their mother&#x2019;s family. They are six<br>miles apart. They hardly ever visit.<br><br>Lourdes sends Enrique $50 a month, occasionally $100,<br>sometimes nothing. It is enough for food but not for school<br>clothes, fees, notebooks, or pencils, which are expensive in<br>Honduras. There is never enough for a birthday present. But<br>Grandmother Mar�a hugs him and wishes him a cheery <i>�Feliz<br>cumplea�os! </i>&#x201c;Your mom can&#x2019;t send enough,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;so we<br>both have to work.&#x201d;<br><br>Enrique loves to climb his grandmother&#x2019;s guayaba tree, but<br>there is no more time for play now. After school, Enrique sells<br>tamales and plastic bags of fruit juice from a bucket hung in the<br>crook of his arm. <i>&#x201c;�Tamarindo! �Pi�a!&#x201d; </i>he shouts.<br><br>Sometimes Enrique takes his wares to a service station where<br>diesel-belching buses rumble into Carrizal. Jostling among<br>mango and avocado vendors, he sells cups of diced fruit.<br>After he turns ten, he rides buses alone to an outdoor food<br>market. He stuffs tiny bags with nutmeg, curry powder, and paprika,<br>then seals them with hot wax. He pauses at big black<br>gates in front of the market and calls out, &#x201c;<i>�Va a querer especias?<br></i>Who wants spices?&#x201d; He has no vendor&#x2019;s license, so he keeps<br>moving, darting between wooden carts piled with papayas.<br>Younger children, five and six years old, dot the curbs, thrusting<br>fistfuls of tomatoes and chiles at shoppers. Others offer to<br>carry purchases of fruits and vegetables from stall to stall in rustic<br>wooden wheelbarrows in exchange for tips. &#x201c;<i>Te ayudo? </i>May I<br>help you?&#x201d; they ask.

Whose voice was she hearing? Her eyes were still closed, and her presence in the Gardens of Life carried little more impact than the space she occupied and the soft sound of her breathing. Sunrise approached, bringing the new day to life. The world was mostly asleep, and the Elves of Arborlon were just beginning to stir. Dreams still held sway.<br><br>She felt again the soft touch and opened her eyes to find its source. A slender silver branch adorned with scarlet leaves rested gently upon her shoulder. It moved slightly, a feather&#x2019;s touch she could feel through her clothing, strange and reassuring.<br><br>&#x2013;�Child, do you hear me&#x2013;�<br><br>Heart hammering, a flush of fear and expectation rushing through her, Arling rose to her knees to face the ancient tree, rocking back on her heels and looking up. She was aware of the branch that lay across her shoulder moving with her, maintaining contact as she shifted her position.<br><br>&#x201c;I am here, Mistress,&#x201d; she whispered.<br><br>All around her, the light was changing, darkness giving way to daybreak, blackness turning silvery with the brightening of the eastern sky. And in that strange, in-�between time the world seemed to hold still around her.<br><br>&#x2013;�Long years have I kept the faith of my calling, strong against the elements and the whimsies and vicissitudes of nature and Man. Long years have I been true to all expectations and challenges, never once regretting what I gave up to be so. But time wears down all living things, and so it is with me&#x2013;�<br><br>It was not her imagination, Arling thought. The tree was speaking to her. The voice she was hearing belonged to the Ellcrys. She could feel a connection between the voice and the branch resting on her shoulder. She could feel the link between them.<br><br>Could feel the link to herself.<br><br>Arling tried to parse this out, to understand what was happening, but now the tree was speaking again.<br><br>&#x2013;�It happens slowly, but there is no mistaking its direction. There remains time to do what is needed, but for that to happen I need you first to understand. You are a Chosen in service to me. Many others have been so. Others besides yourself are so now. But you are special to me, child. You bear the blood markings that tell me no other will serve my purpose so well or so long&#x2013;�<br><br>Arling blinked rapidly, aware that the Ellcrys was praising her for something the tree found in her that she had not found in others. But Arling had no idea what that something was. Blood markings?<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand, Mistress,&#x201d; she blurted.<br><br>She felt a wash of shame when she admitted this. She wanted to be helpful, was anxious to serve in whatever way she could. But the Ellcrys was telling her she was failing, that time was taking its toll, and Arling did not know what it was she was expected to do.<br><br>&#x2013;�I am dying&#x2013;�<br><br>There it was. The truth of things, the words clear and unmistakable. The Ellcrys was coming to the end of her life. Arlingfant felt tears spring to her eyes and found it suddenly hard to breathe. How could this be happening? The Ellcrys was showing no signs of deterioration&#x2014;�no wilt, no shedding, no loss of color or form. All looked to be as it should, yet the tree was telling her otherwise. Telling her! Arlingfant didn&#x2019;t want to be the one made responsible by knowing. She had done everything she had been asked to do and more in the course of her time as a Chosen. She did not deserve this!<br><br>&#x2013;�Child, you are precious to me&#x2013;�<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me that!&#x201d; Arling cried out. &#x201c;I have failed you! I did everything I could, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough. Could you be mistaken? Could you be given medicines and special care to keep you from . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t finish, her words dying away into a series of hiccuping gasps. She was crying uncontrollably, and she couldn&#x2019;t seem to make herself stop.<br><br>Then the branch shifted against her body, and she felt a strange peace settle through her, bringing an end to the tears. She went still, the sounds of her lamentation ceasing. All around her the air turned soft with the scents of flowers and grasses and leaves, smoothing away the hurt and fear.<br><br>&#x2013;�There is much you can do to help me, Arlingfant. My service has been long and successful, and that service must continue. All of the Chosen must care for me in my final days, and you must tell them so. All must band together to keep me safe and comfortable during the time of my passing, but pass I must. Back to where we all one day will go. Back to our birthroots, to our pre-�life, to where we await our next appointing. Try to understand&#x2013;�<br><br>Arling did not understand. Asking her to bring word of this to the others was unbearable. Why choose her as opposed to another? Why ask this of her when so much else was happening?<br><br>But this was selfish thinking, and she would not speak it aloud to her mistress. She was a Chosen, and the Chosen did not complain&#x2014;ever&#x2014;�of what was asked of them during the time of their service.<br><br>&#x201c;I will tell the others,&#x201d; she agreed. Then she hesitated. &#x201c;And we will do much more than you ask. We will find a way to stave this off, to cure you of what afflicts you and make you well and strong again!&#x201d;<br><br>There was a long pause.<br><br>&#x2013;�Oh, child, no. You ignore the truth at your peril. Hear me once again. I have need of you. I have need of your strength and your dedi�cation. I have need of what you are and what you will be when I am gone. Do you not see&#x2013;�<br><br>Arling shook her head in despair. &#x201c;I see only that you need help and I don&#x2019;t know how to give it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2013;�You will give it in the same way that I once did, a long time ago&#x2014;�when I was a girl no older than you are now. When I was one of the Chosen. You will carry my seed to the Bloodfire and immerse it and then return to me, and through you I will be renewed and the Forbidding will hold&#x2013;�<br><br>&#x201c;I will . . . carry . . .&#x201d;<br><br>That was as much as she could manage to repeat before the enormity of what the Ellcrys was saying tightened her throat in such an iron grip of fear that she choked on the rest. She saw it now. She saw what she was being asked to do.<br><br>&#x2013;�You are my Chosen one. You are . . . &#x2013;�<br><br>Instantly Arlingfant was up and running, her dark hair flying out behind her in a tangle. She had broken away from the touch of the Ellcrys, from the voice in her head, from the realization of what was being asked of her and how her life would be altered forever. She felt cold and hot all at once.<br><br>She knew the story. All of the Chosen had known since the time of Amberle Elessedil, who was the last to be called. The tree was said to live forever, and some believed it was so. But the truth was a different matter. The tree had a finite life&#x2014;centuries long, yes, but finite. When its time was up, the tree always selected one among the Chosen to take from it a seedling, to carry that seedling to the Bloodfire, to immerse it in the flames, and then return to become . . .<br><br>No, I cannot do this! It is too much to ask! I will lose everything. I will have to give up my life!<br><br>. . . to become the next Ellcrys, reborn into the world at the death of the old, and linked forever in an endless line of talismans that would keep the Forbidding intact and the demons imprisoned.<br><br>I cannot do this! I am only a girl and nothing special. I was not meant to bear this burden!<br><br>She exploded past Freershan and a couple of the other Chosen coming into the gardens, not even slowing to acknowledge them but racing for the concealment of the trees and the waning darkness, anxious to hide and not emerge again for weeks or months or however long it took for this impossibility to vanish. She ran for her cottage and the comfort of home, trying to regain something that was already lost. She refused to acknowledge it, but she knew it anyway in her heart.<br><br>Then, abruptly, she remembered Aphenglow. She needed her sister&#x2014;�the one person who had always been able to make things right.<br><br>But Aphenglow was leaving for the deep Westland, off on her expedition with Cymrian to find the other Druids and to tell them what had become of abandoned Paranor, following the Federation attack, and of poor Bombax.<br><br>Had she already departed?<br><br>Changing directions in midstride, Arling turned toward the airfield, fighting down the panic surging through her, her face streaked with tears, her breathing ragged. Don&#x2019;t let this be! Don&#x2019;t make it so! She darted through the trees&#x2014;�a slight, almost ephemeral figure in the growing light of dawn&#x2014;�taking paths and byways that shaved seconds off the time required to reach her sister.<br><br>Aphen! Please be there, please!<br><br>Then she burst onto the grassy flats where the airships were anchored, their dark hulls glistening with early-�morning dew&#x2014;�great tethered birds hovering in the windless morning light, their sleek curved shadows cast earthward. She gasped in relief as she caught sight of Wend-�A-�Way, her mooring lines still fastened in place.<br><br>&#x201c;Aphen!&#x201d; she screamed, closing the distance as swiftly as she could, desperation providing her with fresh strength.<br><br>Then her sister was running to meet her, flying across the open fields beneath the canopy of airship hulls, tall and strong and safe. Arling threw herself against Aphen, crying out her name, her face buried in Aphen&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s dying, Aphen, she&#x2019;s dying, and she wants me to take her place and I can&#x2019;t do it, Aphen, I can&#x2019;t!&#x201d;<br><br>Arling sank to the grass, pulling Aphen down with her. Aphen held her sister close, soothing her. Hushing her, saying it was all right, that she was safe.<br><br>Arling drew back, her face stricken. &#x201c;She touched me on the shoulder with her branches and spoke to me. She said she had need of me. She said . . .&#x201d;<br><br>It all poured out of her, a jumble of words riven with emotions that she could barely control, all of it released in a torrent of need and despair.<br><br>&#x201c;Arling, stop now,&#x201d; her sister said at last, taking her firmly by the shoulders and turning her so that they faced each other again. &#x201c;I understand. But we don&#x2019;t know enough yet to be certain of anything. There are Chosen records of the history of the Ellcrys and those who have served her. We should look at those, read what has been written of their history.&#x201d;<br><br>Arling shook her head in denial. &#x201c;What difference will that make? I know what she expects of me. I heard her speak the words.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And then you fled, right in the middle of her explanation.&#x201d; Aphenglow pulled her close, hugging her anew. &#x201c;You need to go back to her. You need to hear the rest. But before you do that, we&#x2019;ll read the records of the Chosen. We may find something of value that will turn things around. Stop crying. I am here with you. I won&#x2019;t leave you to face this alone.&#x201d;<br><br>Cymrian appeared, rushing up. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened? I didn&#x2019;t even realize Arling was here.&#x201d; He knelt beside them, his eyes finding Arling&#x2019;s. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong? Tell me what it is.&#x201d;<br><br>But it was Aphen who repeated the story, keeping alive the possibility of more than one interpretation of the Ellcrys&#x2019;s words. Cymrian listened without interrupting, his eyes never leaving Arling.<br><br>Then he reached out and took her from Aphen and held her against him. &#x201c;Do not fear, Arling,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;I will be your protector now. I will stand with you as I have with Aphen, and I will give up my life before I let anything hurt you.&#x201d;<br><br>Arling shook her head. &#x201c;But you were leaving to find the Ard Rhys. Both of you. You can&#x2019;t stay because of me. Finding the Druids and telling them of Paranor&#x2019;s fate&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2014;�can wait,&#x201d; Aphen finished. &#x201c;What matters now is discovering what is needed to help you, and what can be done about the Ellcrys. If she is truly dying, then we face a far more important task than seeking the missing Elfstones.&#x201d;<br><br>Cymrian nodded, his features somber. &#x201c;If the Ellcrys fails, it doesn&#x2019;t matter whether or not we find them.&#x201d;<br><br>Arling looked from one to the other. She had ceased crying, and her wilder emotions had quieted. She felt better having reached her sister and Cymrian. Maybe Aphen was right and things would turn out differently than she had feared when she fled the Ellcrys. She experienced a momentary shame for having acted so foolishly, for responding in such a childish way.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you both,&#x201d; she said to them.<br><br>&#x201c;We will face this together,&#x201d; Aphen assured her. &#x201c;Starting right now.&#x201d;</p><h2>Effective Supervision: Supporting the Art and Science of Teaching</h2><p>In Effective Supervision, Robert J.

Marzano, Tony Frontier, and David Livingston show school and district-level administrators how to set the priorities and support the practices that will help all teachers become expert teachers. Their five-part framework is based on what research tells us about how expertise develops. When these five conditions are attended to in a systematic way, teachers do improve their skills: <p> * A well-articulated knowledge base for teaching </p><p> * Opportunities for teachers to practice specific strategies or behaviors and to receive feedback</p><p> * Opportunities for teachers to observe and discuss expertise</p><p> * Clear criteria for success and help constructing professional growth and development plans</p><p> * Recognition of the different stages of development progressing toward expertise. </p><p> The focus is on developing a collegial atmosphere in which teachers can freely share effective practices with each other, observe one another's classrooms, and receive focused feedback on their teaching strategies. The constructive dynamics of this approach always keep in sight the aim of enhancing students' well-being and achievement. As the authors note, "The ultimate criterion for expert performance in the classroom is student achievement. Anything else misses the point."</p>Dr. Robert J.

For many people, NI, and health care informatics in general, are about technology. This is especially true of electronic health records (EHRs) that are required of all care facilities. That is just one among many aspects of nursing informatics, a distinctive practice specialty that is the focus of this new publication. The second edition of Nursing Informatics: Scope and Standards of Practice is the most comprehensive, up-to-date resource available in this subject area. The book covers the full scope of nursing informatics and outlines the competency level of nursing practice and professional performance expected from all informatics nurses and nurse specialists. In addition, it details the nursing informatics competencies needed by any RN, spans all nursing careers and roles, and reflects the impact of informatics in any health care practice environment. This is a must-read for nurses, as informatics touches on every RNs practice. The publications scope of practice addresses the context of the who, what, where, when, why and how of NI practice for informatics nurses and informatics nurse specialists. That detailed scope of practice covers the following topics: Metastructures, Concepts and Tools of Nursing Informatics Functional Areas of Nursing Informatics Preparation for Nursing Informatics Specialty Practice Ethics in Nursing Informatics The Future of Nursing Informatics Trends in Regulatory Changes and Quality Standards And much more The 16 nursing informatics standards, which provide a framework for evaluating practice outcomes and goals, are those to which all informatics nurses are held accountable for their practice. The set of specific competencies accompanying each standard serves as essential evidence of compliance with that standard. This foundational volume is primarily directed to those nurses involved with NI practice, education, administration and research. Other nurses, allied health care providers, researchers and scholars will find value in this content, as will employers, insurers, lawyers, policy makers, regulators and other stakeholders.</p><p></p><h2>God&#39;s High Calling For Women</h2><p><p>Women are not inferior to men&#x2014;so why does the church sometimes treat women as less capable or valued than men? </p><p>Women are told to be bold, assertive, independent, and competitive.

The engaging visuals, lively interviews, and imaginative activities provide teachers with a uniquely appetizing reading experience.

The only danger in perusing this book is that it may leave your bag of teaching tricks overflowing with possibilities."--Patrick Ganz, MAT, English teacher, Portsmouth High School, Portsmouth, New Hampshire<br><br> "Wolsey and Lapp present a pragmatic, informative approach to literacy in the disciplines, supported by ample evidence. Authentic instructional examples demonstrate that we do not have to choose between content knowledge and literacy. The book invites us to embrace teaching reading, writing, and communication in ways that produce knowledge in the disciplines."--Vicky Zygouris-Coe, PhD, College of Education and Human Performance, University of Central Florida<br><br> "This book presents a thoughtful and balanced examination of how to best support literacy in the disciplines. Wolsey and Lapp move past the artificial controversy surrounding content-area versus disciplinary literacy. They provide a highly readable, research-based approach for teachers who want to help their students develop the literacy habits that are important to different disciplines. With ready-to-use materials, this volume will be a terrific addition to secondary literacy courses and to professional learning endeavors."--Dianna Townsend, EdD, College of Education, University of Nevada, Reno</p><h2>March 1917: The Red Wheel, Node III, Book 1 (The Center for Ethics and Culture Solzhenitsyn Series)</h2><p><p>To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution, the University of Notre Dame Press is proud to publish Nobel Prize&#x2013;winner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s epic work <i>March 1917</i>, Node III, Book 1, of <i>The Red Wheel</i>.</p> <p><i>The Red Wheel</i> is Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s magnum opus about the Russian Revolution. Solzhenitsyn tells this story in the form of a meticulously researched historical novel, supplemented by newspaper headlines of the day, fragments of street action, cinematic screenplay, and historical overview. The first two nodes&#x2015;<i>August 1914</i> and <i>November 1916</i>&#x2015;focus on Russia&#x2019;s crises and recovery, on revolutionary terrorism and its suppression, on the missed opportunity of Pyotr Stolypin&#x2019;s reforms, and how the surge of patriotism in August 1914 soured as Russia bled in World War I.</p> <p><i>March 1917</i>&#x2015;the third node&#x2015;tells the story of the Russian Revolution itself, during which not only does the Imperial government melt in the face of the mob, but the leaders of the opposition prove utterly incapable of controlling the course of events. The action of book 1 (of four) of <i>March 1917</i> is set during March 8&#x2013;12. The absorbing narrative tells the stories of more than fifty characters during the days when the Russian Empire begins to crumble. Bread riots in the capital, Petrograd, go unchecked at first, and the police are beaten and killed by mobs. Efforts to put down the violence using the army trigger a mutiny in the numerous reserve regiments housed in the city, who kill their officers and rampage. The anti-Tsarist bourgeois opposition, horrified by the violence, scrambles to declare that it is provisionally taking power, while socialists immediately create a Soviet alternative to undermine it. Meanwhile, Emperor Nikolai II is away at military headquarters and his wife Aleksandra is isolated outside Petrograd, caring for their sick children. Suddenly, the viability of the Russian state itself is called into question.</p> <p><i>The Red Wheel</i> has been compared to Tolstoy&#x2019;s <i>War and Peace</i>, for each work aims to narrate the story of an era in a way that elevates its universal significance. In much the same way as Homer&#x2019;s <i>Iliad</i> became the representative account of the Greek world and therefore the basis for Greek civilization, these historical epics perform a parallel role for our modern world.</p></p><p>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1918&#x2013;2008) is widely acknowledged as one of the most important figures&#x2015;and perhaps <i>the</i> most important writer&#x2015;of the last century. His novel <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> (1962) made him famous, and <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i>, published to worldwide acclaim in 1973, further unmasked communism and played a critical role in its eventual defeat. Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel Prize in 1970 and was exiled to the West in 1974. He ultimately published dozens of plays, poems, novels, and works of history, nonfiction, and memoir, including <i>Cancer Ward</i>, <i>In the First Circle</i>, and <i>The Oak and the Calf</i> (a memoir that is continued in <i>Between the Millstones</i>).<br><br>Marian Schwartz is a prizewinning translator of Russian literature. She is the principal translator of the works of Nina Berberova, Mikhail Bulgakov, Ivan Goncharov, and others."[I]n the volume translated by Marian Schwartz, <i>March 1917: The Red Wheel, Node III, Book I</i>, the wheel turns. The Russian Revolution begins, and the chapters become shorter, the rhythm no longer adagio but staccato. Solzhenitsyn doesn&#x2019;t much care about the literary modernism of Western Europe, but he does imitate the kinetic pace of 20th century cinema. . . . In <i>The Red Wheel</i>, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn produced a masterpiece, and proved himself a worthy companion of Dostoevsky and rival of Tolstoy." (Law and Liberty)<br><br>"In his ambitious multivolume work <i>The Red Wheel</i> (<i>Krasnoye Koleso</i>), Solzhenitsyn strove to give a partly historical and partly literary picture of the revolutionary year 1917. Several of these volumes have been translated into English, but the present volume appears in English for the first time. The translation is very well done and ought to give the reader a better understanding of the highly complex events that shook Russia exactly a century ago." (Richard Pipes, emeritus, Harvard University)<br><br>"<i>The Red Wheel</i> and <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i> have been called Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s two 'cathedrals.' You cannot fully understand the horrors of communism and the history of the 20th century without reading them." (New York Journal of Books)<br><br>"Solzhenitsyn's historical epic <i>The Red Wheel</i>, the author's magnum opus, narrates Russia's transition from monarchy to Soviet rule. . . . The present volume, the first book (of four) of the March 1917 node, narrates the events of the Russian Revolution, notably the overthrow of the Tsar's imperial government and the chaos that resulted among opposition leaders unprepared to lead a country in crisis. . . . <i>The Red Wheel</i> is intimidatingly voluminous, but Solzhenitsyn's stream-of-consciousness style&#x2015;and the clarity of Schwartz's careful translation&#x2015;makes for an engaging and dynamic experience, whether reading the novel cover to cover or in individual vignettes." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Progressive historians have whitewashed the Revolution into a 'people&#x2019;s revolution,' inspired by the benevolent and charismatic Lenin and founded on the humanitarian Marx&#x2019;s principles of equality. In truth, the Revolution wasn&#x2019;t even supported by a majority of the proletariat. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s recently translated <i>The Red Wheel: March 1917</i> . . . [is a] sobering antidote to this na�ve view." (<i>Claremont Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"The latest Solzhenitsyn book to appear in English, <i>March 1917</i>, focuses on the great turning point of Russian, indeed world, history: the Russian Revolution. . . . Almost moment by moment, we follow historical and fictional characters from March 8 to March 11, 1917, as chaos unfolds. Although the Kadets think that history must fulfill a story known in advance, Solzhenitsyn shows us a mass of discrepant incidents that fit no coherent narrative." (The New Criterion)<br><br>"<i>March 1917</i> is a long, difficult, confusing masterpiece. No great work of literature is easy to read, but this third installment of <i>The Red Wheel</i>, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's narrative of the events leading to the Russian Revolution, is remarkable in its complexity. The novel presents a polyphonic kaleidoscope of people, places, and events, some real, some fictitious." (<i>Society Journal</i>)<br><br>"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn spent many years in the latter part of his long life working on <i>The Red Wheel</i>, a multivolume chronicle of 'the whirlwind of revolution in Russia.' Until now, only two parts of this hugely ambitious work had appeared in English translation, followed by a long hiatus. Now, at least&#x2015;on the centenary of the Russian Revolution&#x2015;the first part of another volume has appeared in English, <i>March 1917</i>, with translations of the remainder of the work promised. . . . <i>The Red Wheel</i>&#x2015;like Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s life and work taken whole&#x2015;is a testament to hope married to determination." (<i>The Christian Century</i>)<br><br>"Histories tend to collapse events into a single narrative; Solzhenitsyn insists on plurality. He explodes the Russian Revolution back into myriad voices and parts, disarrayed and chaotic, detailed and tumultuous. . . the book is as immersive as binge-worthy television, no little thanks to this excellent translation that renders its prose as masterful in English as it was in Russian. In <i>March 1917</i>, Solzhenitsyn attempts the impossible and succeeds, evoking a fully formed world through episodic narratives that insist on the prosaic integrity of every life, from tsars to peasants. What emerges is a rich history that&#x2019;s truly greater than the sum of its parts." (Foreword Reviews)<br><br>"<i>The Red Wheel</i>, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s epic of World War I and the Russian revolution, belongs to the Russian tradition of vast, densely plotted novels of love and war set during a time of social upheaval. An extended act of author-to-nation communication, this multivolume saga poses the question, 'Where did we go wrong?' and answers it in human and political terms, but with a mystical twist that is unlike anything else in Solzhenitsyn. This translation beautifully conveys the distinctive flavor of Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s prose, with its preternatural concreteness of description, moments of surreal estrangement, and meticulous detailing of the nuances of human relationships in the shadow of encroaching chaos. The novel&#x2019;s reliable, unreliable, and even mendacious character voices, its streams-of-consciousness, and its experimental flourishes possess the same vividness and freshness as they do in Russian. Think <i>Anna Karenina</i> and <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>, with Dostoevsky&#x2019;s <i>Demons</i> thrown in for good measure."

Kirk defended these views in <i>The Secret Commonwealth</i>, an essay that was left in manuscript when he died in 1692. It is a rare and fascinating work, an extraordinary amalgam of science, religion, and folklore, suffused with the spirit of active curiosity and bemused wonder that fills Robert Burton&#x2019;s <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> and the works of Sir Thomas Browne. <i>The Secret Commonwealth</i> is not only a remarkable document in the history of ideas but a study of enchantment that enchants in its own right.<br>First published in 1815 by Sir Walter Scott, then reedited in 1893 by Andrew Lang, with a dedication to Robert Louis Stevenson, <i>The Secret Commonwealth</i> has long been difficult to obtain&#x2014;available, if at all, only in scholarly editions. This new edition modernizes the spelling and punctuation of Kirk&#x2019;s little book and features a wide-ranging and illuminating introduction by the critic and historian Marina Warner, who brings out the originality of Kirk&#x2019;s contribution and reflects on the ongoing life of fairies in the modern mind.</p><p><b>Robert Kirk</b> (1641?&#x2013;1692) was the seventh son of James Kirk, Minister of Aberfoyle. He studied at Edinburgh and St. Andrews, became Minister of Balquhidder in 1664, and succeeded his father at Aberfoyle in 1685. Kirk published the first Gaelic translation of the Psalms and oversaw the preparation of the first romanized version of the Gaelic Bible. <i>The Secret Commonwealth</i> was left in manuscript at the time of his death.<br><b>Marina Warner</b>&#x2019;s studies of religion, mythology, and fairy tales include <i>Alone of All Her Sex: The Myth and the Cult of the Virgin Mary</i>, <i>From the Beast to the Blonde</i>, and <i>Stranger Magic</i> (National Book Critics Circle Award for Literary Criticism; Truman Capote Award). A Fellow of the British Academy, Warner is also a professor of English and creative writing at Birkbeck, University of London. In 2015 she was given the Holberg Prize and in 2017 she was elected president of the Royal Society of Literature. Her most recent book is <i>Forms of Enchantment: Writings on Art and Artists</i>.&#x201c;Kirk treats the land of faery as a mere fact in nature, a world with its own laws, which he investigates without fear of the Accuser of the Brethren. We may thus regard him as an early student in the folk-lore of psychical research.&#x201d; &#x2014;Andrew Lang<br><br>"Kirk is a magnificent dish to set before any student of either folk-lore or folk-psychology." &#x2014;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"A slim quarto-size book (like a paperback novel in boards) and less than a hundred pages of text, this New York Review of Books edition is the first in more than a century and contains a well-written introduction and end notes by Marina Warner.

A smooth-talking Chicago lawyer comes to chat with Sam Vincent, the former prosecutor of Polk County, Arkansas, about a dangerous subject&#x2014;a big prison for violent black convicts near Thebes, Mississippi, up the Yaxahatchee River from Pasagoula. Thebes seems to have dropped out of the Union&#x2014;letters and phone calls go unanswered, and the lawyer has questions that need answers.

Sam has gone to Thebes, a prison for violent African American criminals, on a mission for a client. What he finds there is not only a travesty of justice, but a place where the inhumanity of the jailers is matched by the horrific secret research being carried out on helpless prisoners. Captured and tortured himself, Earl manages to escape, but in short order he's back, along with a hand-picked posse of aging sharpshooters who are eager to prove they've still got what it takes. They're also as intent as Earl is on unmasking the conspiracy and destroying the real criminals.

Elected conventions in at least nine of the thirteen states would have to ratify it before it could take effect. There was reason to doubt whether that would happen. The document we revere today as the foundation of our country&#x2019;s laws, the cornerstone of our legal system, was hotly disputed at the time. Some Americans denounced the Constitution for threatening the liberty that Americans had won at great cost in the Revolutionary War. One group of fiercely patriotic opponents even burned the document in a raucous public demonstration on the Fourth of July.<br> <br>In this splendid new history, Pauline Maier tells the dramatic story of the yearlong battle over ratification that brought such famous founders as Washington, Hamilton, Madison, Jay, and Henry together with less well-known Americans who sometimes eloquently and always passionately expressed their hopes and fears for their new country. Men argued in taverns and coffeehouses; women joined the debate in their parlors; broadsides and newspaper stories advocated various points of view and excoriated others. In small towns and counties across the country people read the document carefully and knew it well. Americans seized the opportunity to play a role in shaping the new nation. Then the ratifying conventions chosen by "We the People" scrutinized and debated the Constitution clause by clause.<br> <br>Although many books have been written about the Constitutional Convention, this is the first major history of ratification. It draws on a vast new collection of documents and tells the story with masterful attention to detail in a dynamic narrative. Each state&#x2019;s experience was different, and Maier gives each its due even as she focuses on the four critical states of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Virginia, and New York, whose approval of the Constitution was crucial to its success.<br> <br>The New Yorker Gilbert Livingston called his participation in the ratification convention the greatest transaction of his life. The hundreds of delegates to the ratifying conventions took their responsibility seriously, and their careful inspection of the Constitution can tell us much today about a document whose meaning continues to be subject to interpretation. Ratification is the story of the founding drama of our nation, superbly told in a history that transports readers back more than two centuries to reveal the convictions and aspirations on which our country was built.</p><p><b>Pauline Maier</b> is the William R.

It was a letter from Virginia&#x2019;s governor, Edmund Randolph, trying to pry him out of retirement.<br> <br>The envelope included a copy of an act passed on December 4 by the Virginia general assembly appointing delegates to a convention in Philadelphia &#x201c;for the purpose of revising the federal constitution&#x201d; and the names of seven delegates the legislature had chosen. Washington&#x2019;s name stood at the top of the list. Randolph explained that the assembly was alarmed by the &#x201c;storms&#x201d; that threatened to bring the American nation to a quick end, as its enemies had predicted. &#x201c;To you I need not press our present dangers,&#x201d; Randolph said. As commander of the army Washington had witnessed the inefficiency of the Continental Congress and could see the steadily &#x201c;increasing langour of our associated republics.&#x201d; Now only those &#x201c;who began, carried on &amp; consummated the revolution&#x201d; could &#x201c;rescue America from the impending ruin.&#x201d; Randolph urged Washington to accept the legislature&#x2019;s unanimous choice of him as a Virginia delegate to the Philadelphia convention.1<br> <br>His appointment was not a complete surprise to Washington. He had tried to head it off in November, after James Madison, a leader of the assembly and former member of the Confederation Congress, warned him that the legislature was going to choose delegates to the convention and that Washington&#x2019;s name would probably be first on the list. It was &#x201c;out of his power&#x201d; to accept such an appointment, Washington replied. A few weeks earlier&#x2014;on October 31, 1786&#x2014;he had notified state chapters of the Society of the Cincinnati that he would not stand for reelection as the society&#x2019;s president and would not attend its second triennial meeting, which was scheduled to convene in Philadelphia on the first Monday in May&#x2014;a week before the federal Convention would assemble in the same city. Washington gave the Cincinnati several compelling reasons for his decision: His private affairs had become seriously &#x201c;deranged&#x201d; by his long absence during the war, and they now needed his &#x201c;entire &amp; unremitting attention&#x201d;; he was deeply and &#x201c;unavoidably engaged&#x201d; in a project to open navigation of the great rivers flowing through Virginia; and, after so many years of arduous service, he yearned for &#x201c;retirement &amp; relaxation from public cares.&#x201d; Moreover, his health was not good: He had recently suffered a violent attack of &#x201c;fever &amp; ague, succeeded by rheumatick pains&#x201d; such as he had never before experienced. How then could he pick up and go to the federal Convention without offending &#x201c;a very respectable &amp; deserving part of the Community&#x2014;the late officers of the American Army,&#x201d; who made up the Society of the Cincinnati?2<br> <br>In fact, Washington had another, more pressing reason for backing away from his association with the Cincinnati, which he explained in confidence to Madison. When he had first agreed to head the new society in 1783, he thought of it as a fraternal organization whose main purpose was to take care of officers&#x2019; widows and other dependents. Then, to his surprise, a pamphlet by South Carolina&#x2019;s Aedanus Burke provoked an uproar against the Cincinnati and, above all, its plan to pass membership on to the eldest sons of Revolutionary War officers. Critics such as Burke said that practice would lead to the creation of an hereditary aristocracy, which was totally at odds with the republican system established by the Revolution.3<br> <br>Washington accepted reelection as president at the Society&#x2019;s first general meeting in 1784 after it proposed several changes in its rules, including the elimination of hereditary membership. But some state chapters refused to ratify the reforms, so by the fall of 1786, as the Society&#x2019;s second general meeting approached, Washington found himself, as he told Madison, in a &#x201c;delicate&#x201d; position. He didn&#x2019;t want to seem disloyal to his fellow officers, who included some of his dearest friends and confidants, nor did he want to support an institution &#x201c;incompatible (some say) with republican principles.&#x201d; Under the circumstances, he simply could not attend the federal Convention in Philadelphia while the Society of the Cincinnati was also meeting there. That was his excuse, deeply felt and, to Madison at least, clearly explained.4<br> <br>Washington was more circumspect with Randolph. He was grateful for the honor conferred on him by the general assembly, he wrote the governor, and in general stood ready to obey the calls of his country. However, there were at the moment &#x201c;circumstances&#x201d; that &#x201c;will render my acceptance of this fresh mark of confidence incompatible with other measures which I had previously adopted&#x201d; and from which he had &#x201c;little prospect of disengaging myself.&#x201d; The legislature should replace him with someone &#x201c;on whom greater reliance can be had,&#x201d; since the likelihood of his nonattendance was too great.5<br> <br>Randolph refused to take no for an answer. Neither he nor the members of Virginia&#x2019;s council of state, to whom he showed Washington&#x2019;s letter, saw any need for Washington to withdraw immediately. It would be as easy for Randolph to appoint another delegate in Washington&#x2019;s place &#x201c;sometime hence&#x201d; as now. Perhaps the obstacles to Washington&#x2019;s attendance would somehow disappear, or the national crisis would become so severe that it outweighed all other considerations. &#x201c;I hope therefore,&#x201d; Randolph wrote, &#x201c;that you will excuse me for holding up your letter for the present.&#x201d; James Madison also urged Washington to leave the door open for a later acceptance in case &#x201c;the gathering clouds should become so dark and menacing as to supercede every consideration, but that of our national existence or safety.&#x201d; Randolph and Madison played Washington like expert fishermen, and Washington, who no doubt understood full well what was going on, decided not to fight.6<br> <br>As a result, when newspapers throughout the country announced Virginia&#x2019;s election of a delegation to the proposed federal Convention, Washington&#x2019;s name remained at the top of the list. No American commanded admiration and trust like Washington, which was precisely why Randolph and Madison were loath to let him resign. His appointment was &#x201c;a mark of the earnestness of Virginia&#x201d; and an invitation to other states to send their best men as delegates to the proposed convention. Indeed, by appointing a notably strong set of delegates&#x2014;which included Washington, Randolph, Madison, the distinguished jurists George Wythe and John Blair, and also George Mason, who had drafted Virginia&#x2019;s state constitution and its influential declaration of rights&#x2014;the Virginia legislature meant to convey a sign of its zeal &#x201c;and its opinion of the magnitude of the occasion.&#x201d;7<br> <br>The proposed convention needed all the support it could get. In late 1786, its chances of actually meeting, much less accomplishing anything, were remote at best. It looked like another in a long line of failed proposals to strengthen the Confederation. This time the call for a convention had come from a handful of state delegates who met from September 11 to 14, 1786, in Annapolis, Maryland, to discuss giving Congress the power to regulate the trade and commerce of the United States. Only five of the nine state delegations showed up on time, though more were on the way. Rather than wait (as usual) for the laggards, the delegations already present called on all the states to send representatives to another meeting in Philadelphia on the second Monday of May, 1787, &#x201c;to devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the Union.&#x201d; Then the meeting adjourned. The delegates had received no authority to call a convention from the state legislatures that appointed them. Moreover, Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation said that any alterations in the Articles had to be &#x201c;agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State.&#x201d;8 Did that mean Congress had to initiate or at least endorse any meeting called to propose changes to the Articles? If so, would the states elect delegates to a convention that was, in the language of the day, &#x201c;irregular&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, called in a way that seemed to bypass the established procedures of the Confederation? <i>Should</i> they?<br> <br>Virginia said they should. On November 23, 1786, the state&#x2019;s general assembly adopted a beautifully crafted act that endorsed the call for a convention and authorized the election of delegates. The act, which Governor Randolph forwarded to the other states as well as to Washington, said the crisis had arrived when &#x201c;the good people of America&#x201d; had to decide whether they were to reap the fruits of independence and a union &#x201c;cemented with so much of their common blood&#x201d; or give way to &#x201c;unmanly jealousies and prejudices, or to partial and transitory interests,&#x201d; and &#x201c;renounce the auspicious blessings prepared for them by the Revolution.&#x201d; The assembly argued that the proposed convention would be a better place to discuss reforms of the federal system than the Confederation Congress, where those debates &#x201c;might be too much interrupted by the ordinary business before them,&#x201d; and where various highly capable individuals could not participate because they were disqualified by law or &#x201c;restrained by peculiar circumstances.&#x201d; It called for the appointment of seven &#x201c;Commissioners,&#x201d; by &#x201c;joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly,&#x201d; and authorized the governor to fill any vacancies if those elected declined to serve. On December 4, the legislature chose its delegates (or commissioners). Virginia, the largest and most populous state in the union, won considerable honor for its early support for the convention&#x2014;although New Jersey had, in fact, chosen its delegates a week earlier.9<br> <br>Washington&#x2019;s name added to the impact of Virginia&#x2019;s action. Suddenly the convention began to look like an event worth taking seriously. The Pennsylvania assembly specifically cited the Virginia precedent on December 30, when it became the third state to elect delegates to the convention. By mid-February, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Georgia had joined the list. That made seven of the thirteen states, which was not enough to assure that the convention would meet, especially since some of them made their appointments contingent on Congress&#x2019;s giving the convention its approval. That so many states were willing to participate was nonetheless remarkable considering how unlikely it seemed at first that anything would come of the proposal.10<br> TO GO OR NOT TO GO<p></p> <br>Letting his name remain on the list of Virginia delegates was one thing; going to Philadelphia was another. Washington had questions to ask, and only a few good ways of getting answers while he remained at Mount Vernon. He scanned newspapers for information, and he picked up more news from a stream of visitors so steady that at times his home seemed like a tavern (though one where the proprietor always picked up the tab). Above all, however, Washington relied on his correspondents, many of whom were old officers of the Continental Army. Over the next four months a surge of letters between them and Washington laid out the problems that made the nation&#x2019;s situation critical, discussed what constitutional changes were needed to remedy those problems, and evaluated the likelihood that the Philadelphia convention would do what had to be done.<br> <br>Soon after receiving Randolph&#x2019;s letter, Washington asked General Henry Knox what the &#x201c;prevailing sentiments&#x201d; on the convention were and how well attended it was likely to be. Knox&#x2019;s friendship with Washington went back to 1775, when Washington took command of the Continental Army camped in Cambridge, Massachusetts, across the Charles River from Boston. It was Knox, a portly onetime Boston bookseller, who had led the expedition that dragged cannon from Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain to Dorchester Heights, where that artillery helped convince the British to evacuate Boston on March 17, 1776. He was with Washington through the rest of the war, during the devastating campaign in New York and Washington&#x2019;s critical victories at Trenton and Princeton, through the miserable winters at Morristown and Valley Forge, and on to the trenches at Yorktown in 1781. Knox was a leading organizer of the Society of the Cincinnati in 1783. Two years later he became the country&#x2019;s secretary of war. Situated as he was in New York and in close contact with members of Congress, he soon became a major source of information on national affairs for a network of correspondents.11<br> <br>Washington also wrote to Connecticut&#x2019;s Colonel David Humphreys, who had been an aide-de-camp during the final years of the revolutionary war and became a particularly trusted and beloved member of the commander&#x2019;s military family. Like Knox, Humphreys had served with Washington from the battles of Long Island and Harlem&#x2014;which Humphreys described in his <i>Essay on the Life of the Honorable Major-General Israel Putnam</i> (1788)&#x2014;through to Yorktown. Washington gave Humphreys the honor of delivering to Congress the flags of the defeated British and German troops, along with his official report on the British capitulation of October 1781. Humphreys was with Washington when he surrendered his commission to Congress on December 23, 1783, then accompanied him back to Mount Vernon, where Humphreys joined the joyful celebrations of the commander&#x2019;s homecoming on Christmas Eve. A member of the Cincinnati, a poet, and a diplomat, Humphreys corresponded regularly with Washington between 1784 and 1786, when he served as secretary to the American commission negotiating commercial treaties in Europe. After he returned to America in 1786, Humphreys stayed at Mount Vernon for six weeks, working on a projected biography of Washington, before returning to Connecticut, where his home town promptly elected him to the state legislature.12<br> <br>Washington considered Humphreys a reliable source of information on the attitudes of the Cincinnati, &#x201c;the temper of the people, and the state of Politics at large,&#x201d; particularly in the northeastern part of the country. He told Humphreys about his exchange of letters with Madison and Randolph, then asked the question that troubled him. If the issue of his attending the convention &#x201c;should be further prest (which I hope it will not, as I have no inclination to go),&#x201d; Washington asked, &#x201c;what had I best do?&#x201d;13<br> <br>&#x201c;No inclination&#x201d; was an understatement. During his eight years away from home while commanding the Continental Army, thoughts of Mount Vernon had been Washington&#x2019;s greatest solace. He tried to write his plantation manager (and distant cousin), Lund Washington, on a regular basis and to direct from afar major renovations of his house, taking respite from war with thoughts of plaster, paint, and newly planted groves of trees. He complained when letters from Virginia failed to arrive since that denied him &#x201c;the consolation of hearing from home, on domestic matters,&#x201d; and he dreamed of the day when he could join those who, in the words of the prophet Micah, had beaten their &#x201c;swords into plowshares&#x201d; and he too could sit at peace &#x201c;under his vine and under his fig tree&#x201d; with no one to make him afraid.14 Once, in 1781, as the army marched toward Yorktown, Washington rode his horse a heroic sixty miles in a single day to get home for a brief visit. It had been over six years since he had seen Mount Vernon. Except for one additional short, sad visit to bury his stepson, Jackie Custis, he would not return for another two years.15 Then, with his military ser...</p><h2>The Book on Writing: The Ultimate Guide to Writing Well</h2><p>You&#x2019;re going to love the way Paula LaRocque teaches in The Book on Writing.

In lyric and documentary poems and essayistic fragments, Aria Aber explores the historical and personal implications of Afghan American relations. Drawing on material dating back to the 1950s, she considers the&nbsp;consequences of these relations&#x2014;in particular the funding of the Afghan mujahedeen, which led to the Taliban and modern-day Islamic terrorism&#x2014;for her family and the world at large.<br><br> Invested in and suspicious of the pain of family and the shame of selfhood, the speakers of these richly evocative and musical poems mourn the magnitude of citizenship as&nbsp;a state of place and a state of mind. While <i>Hard Damage</i> is framed by free-verse poetry, the middle sections comprise a lyric essay in fragments and a long documentary poem. Aber explores Rilke in the original German, the urban melancholia of city life, inherited trauma, and displacement on both linguistic and environmental levels, while employing&nbsp;surrealist and eerily domestic imagery.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Aria Aber </b>is a Ron Wallace Poetry Fellow at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

It reminds readers that every displaced person, whether refugee, immigrant, or the child of one, carries with them a parcel of stories, stories that are often suppressed and mutated by the dominant culture, or lost to reductive media coverage. . . .&nbsp;<i>Hard Damage</i> allows the songs&#x2014;and the lives that they contain&#x2014;to unfurl."&#x2014;Marie Scarles,&nbsp;<i>Rumpus</i> (Marie Scarles <i>Rumpus</i> 2019-09-06)<br><br>"Language is not static in Aber's work&#x2014;it's malleable. It can be used to tell a story behind/within a story. . . . There is so much to be fascinated by in this book. So much to reward the reader."&#x2014;daniellejhanson.com (<i>daniellejhanson.com</i> 2019-10-11)<br><br>"Aber is not afraid of erudition or the hard labor of crafting poems that peel open in layers; at times, reading her work reminded me of poets who have worked across similarly broad linguistic topographies: Carolyn Forch�, Frank Bidart, Paul Celan, Sylvia Plath, Wallace Stevens, and others. But Aber's work here is hardly derivative of those masters. She is her own poet, her own voice, and her debut is my favorite volume of poetry this year."&#x2014;Christian Kiefer,&nbsp;<i>Paris Review</i> (Christian Kiefer <i>Paris Review</i> 2019-10-18)<br><br>"To properly review the new collection <i>Hard Damage</i> . . . you simply want to copy the entire text of the book into your article and just say: <i>Read this.

Aria Aber&#x2019;s <i>Hard Damage</i> is an expansive debut that contends with the hard truth of how elusive belonging, and reckoning, is. . . . Every word, every phrase [of <i>Hard Damage</i>] is crafted to incise, with its electric currents of images that make up the lives of refugee mothers, fathers, and daughters, and the inherent homesickness of language, wars. This debut seduces, critiques, mourns, ruptures, replenishes&#x2014;and not without humor and wit. By the end I found myself completely thrilled that poetry can have this many possibilities.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sally Wen Mao, author of <i>Oculus</i></p> (Sally Wen Mao 2019-05-09)<br><br><p>&#x201c;With disarming ease, Aria Aber&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Hard Damage</i>&nbsp;leaps from the personal to the political, from song to theory, from Rilke to &#x2018;Afghan blow,&#x2019; from a German childhood back to an earlier Afghani family history, ending up in a richly vexed American life. These juxtapositions are electrifying, eloquent. . . . &#x2018;What is it that we owe to each other?&#x2019; Aber asks, calling us into &#x2018;history&#x2019;s collateral light.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Catherine Barnett, author of <i>Human Hours</i></p> (Catherine Barnett 2019-05-09)<br><br>&#x201c;Aria Aber&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Hard Damage</i> confronts the reader with both a masterful directness and lyrical clarity. Though the poet pays homage to tradition, these poems also realize a voice and experience&#x2014;truth and sonority, spirit and grit&#x2014;that are individual. Each turn in this narrative of dislocation dares a root-fed luminosity. Indeed, the speaker of&nbsp;<i>Hard Damage</i> transverses multiple way stations (Kabul, Berlin, Paris, New York City, and elsewhere), always carrying history and family through these migrations.

There is too much barbed beauty for my few sentences to contain, though Aber&#x2019;s do&#x2014;elegantly, dangerously. A tremendous debut we are lucky to behold.&#x201d;&#x2014;Solmaz Sharif, author of <i>Look</i><br> &nbsp; (Solmaz Sharif 2019-05-13)<br><br>&#x201c;Aria Aber presses language until it yields up its secret meanings in this wide-ranging, cosmopolitan, remarkably Rilkean first book of poems. <i>Hard Damage</i> is haunted by questions of inheritance, of home and homelessness, of historical crisis, and it is suffused throughout with a dual feeling of Beauty and Terror.

These are not anecdotal stories or cases of people who never had cancer in the first place. Each history is authenticated by a firm diagnosis and meticulous medical documentation. <p> This new, updated and revised edition includes a follow up 30 years after the patients were diagnosed with incurable cancer. Proof is in the actual life-span of these people who, previously, had been told by their doctors that they had just a few months or weeks to live. </p><p> This book also recounts the personal battle of Dr. John Richardson who incurred the wrath of orthodox medicine when he and his patients elected to use vitamin therapy instead of surgery, drugs, and radiation as the treatment of choice.</p></p><p>Dr. John Richardson was in the forefront of the Laetrile controversy from 1972 until his passing in 1988. He challenged the FDA to secure the right of physician and patient to reject orthodox cancer treatments, in which they have little confidence, and use nutritional therapy instead. He received a Doctorate of Medicine from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and completed internship plus fellowship in medicine at the Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital, Cooperstown, New York. He was awarded the title of Diplomate by the National Board of Medical Examiners and was licensed to practice medicine and surgery in New York.

For the men of the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, downtown Baghdad was one of those places. Moving into the heart of Iraq and ever deeper into enemy territory, they found themselves face-to-face with the ruthless Iraqi Republican Guard and Fedayeen militia. But when the smoke cleared, God&#x2019;s touch was clearly visible.<br><br>Serving as a chaplain to the U.S. Marines, Lieutenant Carey Cash had witnessed the miracles that began in the desert of northern Kuwait, and found their culmination in one of the fiercest battles of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

I only needed to take one look at the face of my executive officer, Major Cal Worth, to realize what was happening. His eyes were like steel; his face, expressionless. My heart raced.<br><br> &#x201c;You have five hours to get your gear packed and yourselves into your vehicles. We&#x2019;re moving north!&#x201d;<br><br> You could have heard a pin drop in the tent. It was an announcement we had been expecting for weeks, yet his words hit us like a train.<br><br> &#x201c;Any questions? No? Good! Then be advised there will be a mandatory staff meeting in thirty minutes. You&#x2019;ll get more info then. Get moving!&#x201d; With that he turned and walked out.<br><br> For the next few moments, no one moved a muscle. We sat on the tops of our sleeping bags in shock, wrestling with the magnitude of what we&#x2019;d just heard. We looked at one another, but no one said a thing. We didn&#x2019;t have to. The words still lingered in the stale air of the tent. Then finally, as if we were responding to a choreographed script, every one of us jumped up and started packing our gear.<br><br> Within minutes, I could tell that the message was permeating the entire camp. Senior Marines were barking out orders. Trucks, tanks, and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs or Humvees) were being moved into place. More than one thousand infantrymen, living in a space no bigger than a parking lot, started packing their personal supplies, filling their canteens, double-checking the status of their ammunition, writing last-minute letters, and saying prayers.<br><br> A young officer grabbed my arm. &#x201c;Hey Chaplain, if something should happen to me, will you give this letter to my girl?&#x201d;<br><br> Hey, wait a minute, I thought. That&#x2019;s just for the movies.<br><br> The man who handed me the letter was a decorated combat veteran. He had been among the first to land deep in enemy territory in Afghanistan. He&#x2019;d been through this before, and his face was quite serious. I took the letter.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be okay,&#x201d; I reassured him.<br><br> Was I sure about that? I tucked his letter deep within my pack, quietly hoping that I would never have to pull it out.<br><br> Meanwhile, the frenzy of activity intensified. I could see the camps next to ours springing to life as well. Flashlights from every tent shot beams across the clear desert sky. Engines rumbled to life. The sound of men&#x2019;s voices, some laughing and joking, some urgent and tense, were echoing from camp to camp. This was it! We were all heading out. Would we ever see this place again?<br><br> It was the evening of March 17, 2003. We had already been in the desert for forty days. Tired and restless, we were quite honestly wondering if the war was ever going to get kicked off. Two or three weeks were all that we&#x2019;d expected to wait before the official word came to invade Iraq, yet there we were, approaching a month and a half. By now the days were growing longer, and the sun was getting ever hotter. The hope of a hot shower had all but evaporated, and shaving was merciless. The cold water had dulled the last of our razors, producing a wide variety of facial grimaces each morning as we pulled and tugged on our beards.<br><br> And then there were the sandstorms. Before arriving in Kuwait, we had all been told about the intense desert winds. But there was no way we could ever have anticipated how vio- lent the storms would get. The weather pattern that brought them about was no mystery. When the wind blew in from the north, we enjoyed clear skies. But when the wind shifted directions and started blowing from the south, the sky would turn a deep dark blue, then brown; and then, like a thundering horde rolling indiscriminately over man and beast, the stinging sand would consume us. There was no escaping its relentless barrage. At times it would beat its implacable drum against our tents for hours. Our romantic notions were fading fast as every new sandstorm further eroded the grandeur of &#x201c;going off to war.&#x201d;<br><br> During those forty days, when we weren&#x2019;t rehearsing our attack, we spent much of our time laboring to piece together any fragments of news we could get our hands on. What was happening in the White House? In Baghdad? Had diplomacy run its course? What of the inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction? How were Americans viewing the war? How were they viewing us? How real was the threat of chemical weapons? Would the enemy surrender quickly? Or would he fight to the death?<br><br> We were all asking the same questions. We were all looking for something, anything, to cling to; any precious bit of news that might provide us with some sense of certainty either way. In the end we would have to settle for outdated newspapers and garbled radio transmissions that relayed as much static as commentary. Phone calls were precious but rare; the mail was slow. After forty days in a vast and often unforgiving desert, urgency had faded into monotony.<br><br> Marines and soldiers, however, have solutions for deal- ing with monotony. In fact, every Marine who is qualified enough to rise to the rank of corporal is expected by his command to be able to accurately diagnose the morale of his men and to come up with some clever antidote for the ailment, like a doctor who writes out prescriptions for sick patients. Of course the antidotes are as diverse as the men who think them up&#x2014;a forced march, a grueling run. Or, if the men are lucky and their leader happens to be in particularly amiable spirits, the prescription might be a Humvee pull, a tire-throw, or a tug-of-war match.<br><br> On that particular Tuesday night in mid-March, it was obvious that no half-measures would do. The frustration of waiting had finally worked itself, like a thorn, into the skin of most of us. Faces were growing long. Arguments were becoming a daily ritual. Friendships were strained. Something had to be done, so the decision was unanimous. The antidote to our desert malaise would be a talent show.<br><br> As word leaked out about the night&#x2019;s main event, I could sense growing excitement. At least I know I was looking forward to it. For six weeks, everything had been business: chemical weapons drills, battalion hikes, live-fire ranges, late-night staff meetings, intelligence updates. We knew we were there on a mission, and from day one, we did nothing but prepare ourselves for it. So when the decision was made to host a battalion-wide talent show, it was as if a breath of fresh air blew throughout the entire camp, enlivening even the most dispirited man.<br><br> I had just finished off the last of my broiled chicken and rice and was enjoying the sweet taste of my warm soda when I first began to hear laughter. It wasn&#x2019;t the roaring kind of laughter you might expect to come from the lungs of grown men or warriors. This was more like snickering and giggling, the kind of laughter you&#x2019;d hear behind a child&#x2019;s door at a slumber party. I was amused but also intrigued. The sound of the voices began to lighten my spirit, and like a magnet, it pulled me outside into the cool desert night to investigate. As I walked from tent to tent, I could see groups of Marines and sailors huddled together, feverishly planning out their appearances for the night&#x2019;s coming festivities. They were rehearsing every type of act imaginable: singing, skits, stand-up comedy, classical guitar, and just as I expected, those always-feared, never-avoided impersonations.<br><br> Young infantrymen&#x2014;also known as &#x201c;grunts&#x201d;&#x2014;can&#x2019;t get away with much when it comes to challenging authority; and few ever try. However, impersonations are different. Impersonating a senior-ranking Marine is, to my knowledge, the one and only time a grunt can take a stab at his superiors and still come out alive. It&#x2019;s almost sacrosanct; an understood realm of asylum, of immunity from reprisal. Overhearing some of the skits and impersonations that a few brave men were planning that night, I knew that some of them were sure to get a rise from the crowd that was already beginning to gather around the seven-ton truck that now doubled as our stage.<br><br> By 8:00 p.m., the judges were in place, the performers were ready, and the audience was stirring. Under dim flickering lights, and armed with a substandard sound system, the men of First Battalion, Fifth Marine Regiment hosted what must have been the finest talent show the northern Kuwaiti desert had ever witnessed.<br><br> Of course I had seen grown men laugh hysterically before. Having attended a military college where I played varsity football, I&#x2019;d known my own share of rowdy evenings out with the guys. But this was altogether different. More than a good time, this was a release. This was six weeks of pent-up tension and anxiety erupting into the night sky in the form of laughter and cheering. There was no doubt that every person out there needed that night to chase away the stress and frustration of the last six weeks of waiting. We needed it to drive away the feelings of loneliness that grew stronger with every passing night. We needed it to deal with our fear.<br><br> Yet therapeutic as the evening was, I couldn&#x2019;t shake the feeling that something was about to happen. There we were in a hostile land, only miles from a border where enemy soldiers patrolled continuously. We all knew that an order might come down at any moment, leading us into mortal combat. Shadowing our exuberance and elation was the very real and imminent prospect of danger and death. One thousand of us were laughing, singing, and cheering; yet we were also poised to enter a different world, where such festivi- ties would be impossible. Was this, quite literally, the last hoorah?<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t share my uneasiness with anyone else, but I am certain others felt the same way. Nevertheless, inebriated by laughter and camaraderie, all one thousand of us went to sleep that night in peace about 11:00 p.m. Three hours later, we learned that our lives were about to change forever.<br> In those silent seconds following Major Worth&#x2019;s middle-of-the-night announcement, my thoughts turned toward my fellow chaplains. The four of us had ministered together for six weeks in the desert. We each represented different Christian faith groups: Chaplain Frank Holley, a Methodist; Chaplain Erik Lee, a Nazarene; Chaplain Mark Tanis, a Lutheran; and I, a Baptist. In the course of those weeks, we had all become close friends, even brothers. We conducted services together, assisted each other in baptisms and counseling, and offered one another a listening ear when we needed to vent. When would I ever see them again?<br><br> My mind snapped to at the sound of a familiar voice.<br><br> &#x201c;Sir, do you need any help loading your supplies?&#x201d;<br><br> It was a voice I recognized well, even in the dark. Second Class Petty Officer Redor Rufo was my personal assistant&#x2014;a religious program specialist (RP), who assists me in the administrative tasks required to conduct ministry. That is not, however, his only job. In war, the RP is a chaplain&#x2019;s bodyguard. Geneva Convention and navy regulations do not permit chaplains to serve as combatants. In fact, a chaplain is the only member of the entire military who is not permitted to brandish a weapon. Chaplains sometimes speculate about what they would do if their men were overrun, if they had the choice to defend themselves with a rifle or pistol. It&#x2019;s a tough call, but I always thought that if the life of a fellow Marine or sailor was at stake, I&#x2019;d use the weapon.<br><br> Nevertheless, I knew Rufo would not hesitate to use his rifle if we ever found ourselves in real danger. He had the heart of a giant and the tenacity of a street fighter. A 5'4" Filipino-American with a stout build and cackling laugh, Redor Rufo had come to the States when he was in high school, following in the footsteps of two older brothers who had joined the navy before him. Always the generous peacemaker, Rufo overwhelmingly won the affection of the senior men in the battalion just two days after he arrived. He managed to do this by cooking up some of his famous panzet and lumpia, and serving them out of our office space.<br><br> Rufo&#x2019;s spirited generosity was no passing fancy. He&#x2019;s the only man I&#x2019;ve ever heard kidding about having his own island one day; he would call his island Rufo Island, and he would be its benevolent dictator. The truth is, although farfetched, anyone who knew Rufo could easily see him doing just that: granting favors, pardons, gifts, and loving every minute of it. Still, kind and peaceable as he was, Rufo knew how to scrap. It didn&#x2019;t take me long to learn that despite his small frame, he could hold his own with anybody.<br><br> The two of us had served together since April 2002, when he joined the battalion. Every day had been an opportunity for us to grow in our mutual trust and respect for one another. Everywhere I went, Rufo was with me. If it meant walking the line together for hours on end, talking to young warriors in fighting holes, he walked beside me. If it meant setting up and taking down for eight worship services in one day, he was there, never flagging in zeal, always an encouragement to the other men in the battalion.<br><br> As the two of us loaded supplies into our Humvee, I sensed a note of pain in his voice. &#x201c;I got to talk to my wife last night, sir. I waited in line for the phone for hours, but I finally got through. I&#x2019;m so glad I did.&#x201d;<br><br> Calling home from Kuwait was definitely a rarity. There was only one phone for more than a thousand men, and more often than not, the phone wasn&#x2019;t working. When the phone actually functioned, you had to be prepared to speak to your loved one through a three-second delay.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello . . . can you hear me?&#x201d;<br><br> Three to four seconds would pass, and then the voice on the other end would inevitably answer, &#x201c;Yes . . . I can hear you . . .&#x201d;<br><br> On and on this would go, until &#x201c;good-bye.&#x201d;<br><br> Calls home had the effect of producing both joy and pain. We were elated anytime we had the opportunity to call our wives or parents. Yet with each phone call came the quiet realization that this call might be the last one before we went into battle. Every word spoken was precious; every moment, dear. As good as it felt to hear your loved one&#x2019;s voice, many of our men said that it caused more pain than anything else. I know it did for me. It reminded me of home. And there were more than a few in our battalion who deliberately chose not to call. I could understand why. It just hurt too much.<br><br> Clearly, Rufo was glad he&#x2019;d been able to talk to his wife. But I could tell there was an ache in his heart. There was one in mine too.<br><br> It had been more than a month since I had spoken to my wife, Charity, and that conversation had lasted only a few minutes. When the phone rang in our Southern California home, it was 4:00 in the morning.<br><br> Charity&#x2019;s voice, suddenly stirred out of sleep, quietly answered, &#x201c;Hello.&#x201d;<br><br> Overjoyed to hear her voice, it was all I could do not to shout to her, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me&#x2014;Carey!&#x201d;<br><br> Immediately, I could tell that she had begun to cry. We both started crying as a flood of emotions swept over us.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know when I&#x2019;ll be able to talk to you again, but just know that I am doing well. God is taking care of me.&#x201d;<br><br> For security purposes, I was not able to tell her exactly where I was, when we thought we might be moving north, or how long our stay might be. But that didn&#x2019;t matter. More than anything else, I wanted her to know that I was okay, that the men were doing well, that we were relying on the Lord, that her prayers for us were being answered daily in our lives, and, most of all, that I loved her and the children. Every minute of the conversation was filled wi...</p><h2>How Kind!</h2><p><b>What goes around comes around in this farmyard tale about the contagiousness of kindness.</b><br><br>Hen gives Pig an unexpected present. "How kind!" says Pig. Pig is so touched, in fact, that he decides to do something kind too. So Pig gives Rabbit a gift. "How kind!" says Rabbit, who does something kind for Cow, who is kind to Cat, who wants to be kind in turn. Where will all of this kindness lead?</p><p>Mary Murphy has an advanced diploma in Visual Communications and has written and illustrated a number of children&#x2019;s books, including her lift-the-flap, pull-the-tab book about friendship, ROXIE AND BO TOGETHER. In addition to creating books, Mary Murphy teaches illustration. HOW KIND!, she says, is about "the great feelings kindness generates, for giver and receiver. It&#x2019;s about how kindness spreads - and how givers always receive. Try shouting &#x2018;How kind!&#x2019; whenever you read it in this book."Streamlined compositions complement the straightforward message in this circular tale in which one good deed hatches another (and another and another). Hen triggers a string of goodwill gestures when she gives her egg away to Pig. "How kind!" Pig responds, then thinks, "I would like to do something kind too." He gives Rabbit a carrot and so continues the sequence of thoughtful acts that eventually leads back to Hen. Using a few assured strokes, Murphy (Roxie and Bo Together) depicts the happy farm animals with their innocent mannerisms; for example, just two easy lines in the neighborhood of Pig's eye convey his pleasure while Puppy scratches Pig's back. A handful of vibrant colors, varying from spread to spread, adds verve, as when the lilac Cat chases the chartreuse Puppy down an orange path, against green ground. The thick black outlines that define each character match the oversize rounded type that, resembling a child's printing, often sprawls across most of a page. The absence of superfluous background details and the flat perspective aptly suit the story's direct theme and keep readers focused on its meaning. Sure to resonate with its intended preschool audience.

At the center of each of these books is always a strong and resourceful young woman who masters the arts of swordplay and knightly warfare in the magical medieval country of Tortall. Alianne, or Aly, daughter of the warrior queen Alanna the Lioness, has all these skills, but also a delicious sense of humor, which serves her well when she is chosen by the trickster god Kyprioth to serve as his secret agent and a slave for a year in the embattled Copper Isles. There the dark-skinned natives, or raka, have been conquered and crushed by the laurin, light-skinned people from the mainland. The burning raka resentment is fueled by prophecies of a twice royal queen who will free them, aided by the "wise one, the cunning one, the strong one, the warrior, and the crows." Just how each of the colorful characters and Aly herself fit into this prophecy and Kyprioth&#x2019;s tricky plan keeps readers guessing.

She was the great-niece of Mark Twain. Daddy-Long-Legs was not her first book, but it is the one for which she is mostly remembered. It was published in 1912, followed by a sequel in 1914 called Dear Enemy. She married in 1915 and tragically died in childbirth a year later."Blue Wednesday"<br><br> The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Day--a day to be awaited with dread, endured with courage and forgotten with haste. Every floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed without a wrinkle. Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams; and all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say, "Yes, sir," "No, sir," whenever a Trustee spoke.<br><br> It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, had to bear the brunt of it. But this particular first Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close. Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches for the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular work. Her special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four to seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row. Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and started them in an orderly and willing line toward the dining-room to engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune pudding.<br><br> Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples against the cool glass. She had been on her feet since five that morning, doing everybody's bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous matron. Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that calm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees and lady visitors. Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen lawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the asylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates, to the spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.<br><br> The day was ended--quite successfully, so far as she knew. The Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds, and read their reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying home to their own cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome little charges for another month. Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosity--and a touch of wistfulness--the stream of carriages and automobiles that rolled out of the asylum gates. In imagination she followed first one equipage, then another, to the big houses dotted along the hillside. She pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with feathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring "Home" to the driver. But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred.<br><br> Jerusha had an imagination--an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her, that would get her into trouble if she didn't take care--but keen as it was, it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would enter. Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha, in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house; she could not picture the daily routine of those other human beings who carried on their lives undiscommoded by orphans.<br> Je-ru-sha Ab-bott You are wan-ted In the of-fice, And I think you'd Better hurry up!<br> Tommy Dillon, who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs and down the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached room F. Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced the troubles of life.<br><br> "Who wants me?" she cut into Tommy's chant with a note of sharp anxiety.<br> Mrs. Lippett in the office, And I think she's mad. Ah-a-men!<br> Tommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious. Even the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring sister who was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron; and Tommy liked Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm and nearly scrub his nose off.<br><br> Jerusha went without comment, but with two parallel lines on her brow. What could have gone wrong, she wondered. Were the sandwiches not thin enough? Were there shells in the nut cakes? Had a lady visitor seen the hole in Susie Hawthorn's stocking? Had--O horrors!--one of the cherubic little babes in her own room F "sassed" a Trustee?<br><br> The long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs, a last Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that led to the porte-cochere. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression of the man--and the impression consisted entirely of tallness. He was waving his arm toward an automobile waiting in the curved drive. As it sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant, the glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside. The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran along the floor and up the wall of the corridor. It looked, for all the world, like a huge, wavering daddy-long-legs.<br><br> Jerusha's anxious frown gave place to quick laughter. She was by nature a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be amused. If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the oppressive fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good. She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode, and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett. To her surprise the matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable; she wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned for visitors.<br><br> "Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you."<br><br> Jerusha dropped into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness. An automobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it.<br><br> "Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?"<br><br> "I saw his back."<br><br> "He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums of money toward the asylum's support. I am not at liberty to mention his name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown."<br><br> Jerusha's eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees with the matron.<br><br> "This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys. You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize? They were both sent through college by Mr.--er--this Trustee, and both have repaid with hard work and success the money that was so generously expended. Other payment the gentleman does not wish. Heretofore his philanthropies have been directed solely toward the boys; I have never been able to interest him in the slightest degree in any of the girls in the institution, no matter how deserving. He does not, I may tell you, care for girls."<br><br> "No, ma'am," Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected at this point.<br><br> "To-day at the regular meeting, the question of your future was brought up."</p><h2>The Unreal and the Real: The Selected Short Stories of Ursula K.

His silence was grand and oppressive; his body under the sheet that dropped in stiff folds, his face were as indifferent as stone. The mother, as if challenged by that silence and indifference, spoke loudly: &#x201c;What did you do it for? Do you want to die before I do? Look at him, look at him, my beauty, my hawk, my river, my son!&#x201d; Her sorrow boasted of itself. She rose to the occasion like a lark to the morning. His silence and her outcry meant the same thing: the unendurable made welcome. The younger son stood listening. They bore him down with their grief as large as life. Unconscious, heedless, broken like a piece of chalk, that body, his brother, bore him down with the weight of the flesh, and he wanted to run away, to save himself.<br> <br>The man who had been saved stood beside him, a little stooped fellow, middle-aged, limestone dust white in his knuckles. He too was borne down. &#x201c;He saved my life,&#x201d; he said to Stefan, gaping, wanting an explanation. His voice was the flat toneless voice of the deaf.<br> <br>&#x201c;He would,&#x201d; Stefan said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;d do.&#x201d;<br> <br>He left the hospital to get his lunch. Everybody asked him about his brother. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll live,&#x201d; Stefan said. He went to the White Lion for lunch, drank too much. &#x201c;Crippled? Him? Kostant? So he got a couple of tons of rock in the face, it won&#x2019;t hurt him, he&#x2019;s made of the stuff. He wasn&#x2019;t born, he was quarried out.&#x201d; They laughed at him as usual. &#x201c;Quarried out,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Like all the rest of you.&#x201d; He left the White Lion, went down Ardure Street four blocks straight out of town, and kept on straight, walking northeast, parallel with the railroad tracks a quarter mile away. The May sun was small and greyish overhead. Underfoot there were dust and small weeds. The karst, the limestone plain, jigged tinily about him with heatwaves like the transparent vibrating wings of flies. Remote and small, rigid beyond that vibrant greyish haze, the mountains stood. He had known the mountains from far off all his life, and twice had seen them close, when he took the Brailava train, once going, once coming back. He knew they were clothed in trees, fir trees with roots clutching the banks of running streams and with branches dark in the mist that closed and parted in the mountain gullies in the light of dawn as the train clanked by, its smoke dropping down the green slopes like a dropping veil. In the mountains the streams ran noisy in the sunlight; there were waterfalls. Here on the karst the rivers ran underground, silent in dark veins of stone. You could ride a horse all day from Sfaroy Kampe and still not reach the mountains, still be in the limestone dust; but late on the second day you would come under the shade of trees, by running streams. Stefan Fabbre sat down by the side of the straight unreal road he had been walking on, and put his head in his arms. Alone, a mile from town, a quarter mile from the tracks, sixty miles from the mountains, he sat and cried for his brother. The plain of dust and stone quivered and grimaced about him in the heat like the face of a man in pain.<br> <br>He got back an hour late from lunch to the office of the Chorin Company where he worked as an accountant. His boss came to his desk: &#x201c;Fabbre, you needn&#x2019;t stay this afternoon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if you want to go to the hospital . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What can I do there? I can&#x2019;t sew him back up, can I?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As you like,&#x201d; the boss said, turning away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not me that got a ton of rocks in the face, is it?&#x201d; Nobody answered him.<br> <br>When Kostant Fabbre was hurt in the rockslide in the quarry he was twenty-six years old; his brother was twenty-three; their sister Rosana was thirteen. She was beginning to grow tall and sullen, to weigh upon the earth. Instead of running, now, she walked, ungainly and somewhat hunched, as if at each step she crossed, unwilling, a threshold. She talked loudly, and laughed aloud. She struck back at whatever touched her, a voice, a wind, a word she did not understand, the evening star. She had not learned indifference, she knew only defiance. Usually she and Stefan quarrelled, touching each other where each was raw, unfinished. This night when he got home the mother had not come back from the hospital, and Rosana was silent in the silent house. She had been thinking all afternoon about pain, about pain and death; defiance had failed her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look so down,&#x201d; Stefan told her as she served out beans for supper. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think . . . Somebody was saying he might be, you know. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Crippled? No, he&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you think he, you know, ran to push that fellow out of the way?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No why to it, Ros. He just did it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was touched that she asked these questions of him, and surprised at the certainty of his answers. He had not thought that he had any answers.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s queer,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Kostant . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Knocked the keystone out of your arch, didn&#x2019;t it? Wham! One rock falls, they all go.&#x201d; She did not understand him; she did not recognise the place where she had come today, a place where she was like other people, sharing with them the singular catastrophe of being alive. Stefan was not the one to guide her. &#x201c;Here we all are,&#x201d; he went on, &#x201c;lying around each of us under our private pile of rocks. At least they got Kostant out from under his and filled him up with morphine. . . . D&#x2019;you remember once when you were little you said &#x2018;I&#x2019;m going to marry Kostant when I grow up.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Rosana nodded. &#x201c;Sure. And he got real mad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because mother laughed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was you and dad that laughed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Neither of them was eating. The room was close and dark around the kerosene lamp.<br> <br>&#x201c;What was it like when dad died?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You were there,&#x201d; Stefan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was nine. But I can&#x2019;t remember it. Except it was hot like now, and there were a lot of big moths knocking their heads on the glass. Was that the night he died?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What was it like?&#x201d; She was trying to explore the new land.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. He just died. It isn&#x2019;t like anything else.&#x201d;<br> <br>The father had died of pneumonia at forty-six, after thirty years in the quarries. Stefan did not remember his death much more clearly than Rosana did. He had not been the keystone of the arch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have we got any fruit to eat?&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl did not answer. She was gazing at the air above the place at the table where the elder brother usually sat. Her forehead and dark eyebrows were like his, were his: likeness between kin is identity, the brother and sister were, by so much or so little, the curve of brow and temple, the same person; so that, for a moment, Kostant sat across the table mutely contemplating his own absence.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is there any?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think there&#x2019;s some apples in the pantry,&#x201d; she answered, coming back to herself, but so quietly that in her brother&#x2019;s eyes she seemed briefly a woman, a quiet woman speaking out of her thoughts; and he said with tenderness to that woman, &#x201c;Come on, let&#x2019;s go over to the hospital. They must be through messing with him by now.&#x201d;<br> <br>The deaf man had come back to the hospital. His daughter was with him. Stefan knew she clerked at the butcher&#x2019;s shop. The deaf man, not allowed into the ward, kept Stefan half an hour in the hot, pine-floored waiting room that smelled of disinfectant and resin. He talked, walking about, sitting down, jumping up, arguing in the loud even monotone of his deafness. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going back to the pit. No sir. What if I&#x2019;d said last night I&#x2019;m not going into the pit tomorrow? Then how&#x2019;d it be now, see? I wouldn&#x2019;t be here now, nor you wouldn&#x2019;t, nor he wouldn&#x2019;t, him in there, your brother. We&#x2019;d all be home. Home safe and sound, see? I&#x2019;m not going back to the pit. No, by God. I&#x2019;m going out to the farm, that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m going. I grew up there, see, out west in the foothills there, my brother&#x2019;s there. I&#x2019;m going back and work the farm with him. I&#x2019;m not going back to the pit again.&#x201d;<br> <br>The daughter sat on the wooden bench, erect and still. Her face was narrow, her black hair was pulled back in a knot. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you hot?&#x201d; Stefan asked her, and she answered gravely, &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m all right.&#x201d; Her voice was clear. She was used to speaking to her deaf father. When Stefan said nothing more she looked down again and sat with her hands in her lap. The father was still talking. Stefan rubbed his hands through his sweaty hair and tried to interrupt. &#x201c;Good, sounds like a good plan, Sachik. Why waste the rest of your life in the pits.&#x201d; The deaf man talked right on.<br> <br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t hear you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you take him home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t make him leave here even for dinner. He won&#x2019;t stop talking.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her voice was much lower saying this, perhaps from embarrassment, and the sound of it caught at Stefan. He rubbed his sweaty hair again and stared at her, thinking for some reason of smoke, waterfalls, the mountains.<br> <br>&#x201c;You go on home.&#x201d; He heard in his own voice the qualities of hers, softness and clarity. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get him over to the Lion for an hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you won&#x2019;t see your brother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t run away. Go on home.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the White Lion both men drank heavily. Sachik talked on about the farm in the foothills, Stefan talked about the mountains and his year at college in the city. Neither heard the other. Drunk, Stefan walked Sachik home to one of the rows of party-walled houses that the Chorin Company had put up in &#x2019;95 when they opened the new quarry. The houses were on the west edge of town, and behind them the karst stretched in the light of the half-moon away on and on, pocked, pitted, level, answering the moonlight with its own pallor taken at third-hand from the sun. The moon, second-hand, worn at the edges, was hung up in the sky like something a housewife leaves out to remind her it needs mending. &#x201c;Tell your daughter everything is all right,&#x201d; Stefan said, swaying at the door. &#x201c;Everything is all right,&#x201d; Sachik repeated with enthusiasm, &#x201c;aa-all right.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stefan went home drunk, and so the day of the accident blurred in his memory into the rest of the days of the year, and the fragments that stayed with him, his brother&#x2019;s closed eyes, the dark girl looking at him, the moon looking at nothing, did not recur to his mind together as parts of a whole, but separately with long intervals between.<br> <br>ON THE KARST THERE ARE no springs; the water they drink in Sfaroy Kampe comes from deep wells and is pure, without taste. Ekata Sachik tasted the strange spring-water of the farm still on her lips as she scrubbed an iron skillet at the sink. She scrubbed with a stiff brush, using more energy than was needed, absorbed in the work deep below the level of conscious pleasure. Food had been burned in the skillet, the water she poured in fled brown from the bristles of the brush, glittering in the lamplight. They none of them knew how to cook here at the farm. Sooner or later she would take over the cooking and they could eat properly. She liked housework, she liked to clean, to bend hot-faced to the oven of a woodburning range, to call people in to supper; lively, complex work, not a bore like clerking at the butcher&#x2019;s shop, making change, saying &#x201c;Good day&#x201d; and &#x201c;Good day&#x201d; all day. She had left town with her family because she was sick of that. The farm family had taken the four of them in without comment, as a natural disaster, more mouths to feed, but also more hands to work. It was a big, poor farm. Ekata&#x2019;s mother, who was ailing, crept about behind the bustling aunt and cousin; the men, Ekata&#x2019;s uncle, father, and brother, tromped in and out in dusty boots; there were long discussions about buying another pig. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s better here than in the town, there&#x2019;s nothing in the town,&#x201d; Ekata&#x2019;s widowed cousin said; Ekata did not answer her. She had no answer. &#x201c;I think Martin will be going back,&#x201d; she said finally, &#x201c;he never thought to be a farmer.&#x201d; And in fact her brother, who was sixteen, went back to Sfaroy Kampe in August to work in the quarries.<br> <br>He took a room in a boarding house. His window looked down on the Fabbres&#x2019; back yard, a fenced square of dust and weeds with a sad-looking fir tree at one corner. The landlady, a quarrier&#x2019;s widow, was dark, straight-backed, calm, like Martin&#x2019;s sister Ekata. With her the boy felt manly and easy. When she was out, her daughter and the other boarders, four single men in their twenties, took over; they laughed and slapped one another on the back; the railway clerk from Brailava would take out his guitar and play music-hall songs, rolling his eyes like raisins set in lard. The daughter, thirty and unmarried, would laugh and move about a great deal, her shirtwaist would come out of her belt in back and she would not tuck it in. Why did they make so much fuss? Why did they laugh, punch one another&#x2019;s shoulders, play the guitar and sing? They would begin to make fun of Martin. He would shrug and reply gruffly. Once he replied in the language used in the quarry pits. The guitar player took him aside and spoke to him seriously about how one must behave in front of ladies. Martin listened with his red face bowed. He was a big, broad-shouldered boy. He thought he might pick up this clerk from Brailava and break his neck. He did not do it. He had no right to. The clerk and the others were men; there was something they understood which he did not understand, the reason why they made a fuss, rolled their eyes, played and sang. Until he understood that, they were justified in telling him how to speak to ladies. He went up to his room and leaned out the window to smoke a cigarette. The smoke hung in the motionless evening air which enclosed the fir tree, the roofs, the world in a large dome of hard, dark-blue crystal. Rosana Fabbre came out into the fenced yard next door, dumped out a pan of dishwater with a short, fine swing of her arms, then stood still to look up at the sky, foreshortened, a dark head over a white blouse, caught in the blue crystal. Nothing moved for sixty miles in all directions except the last drops of water in the dishpan, which one by one fell to the ground, and the smoke of Martin&#x2019;s cigarette curling and dropping away from his fingers. Slowly he drew in his hand so that her eye would not be caught by the tiny curl of smoke. She sighed, whacked the dishpan on the jamb of the door to shake out the last drops, which had already run out, turned, went in; the door slammed. The blue air rejoined without a flaw where she had stood. Martin murmured to that flawless air the word he had been advised not to say in front of ladies, and in a moment, as if in answer, the evening star shone out northwestwards high and clear.<br> <br>Kostant Fabbre was home, and alone all day now that he was able to get across a room on crutches. How he spent these vast silent days no one considered, probably least of all himself. An active man, the strongest and most intelligent worker in the quarries, a crew foreman since he was twenty-three, he had had no practice at all at idleness, or solitude. He had always used his time to the full in work. Now time must use him. He watched it at work upon him without dismay or impatience, carefully, like an apprentice watching a master. He employed all his strength to learn his new trade, that of weakness. The silence in which he passed the days clung to him now as the limestone dust had used to cling to his skin.<br> <br>The mother worked in the dry-goods shop ti...</p><h2>Java: A Beginner&#39;s Guide, Eighth Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><b><br></b><b>Up-to-Date, Essential Java Programming Skills&#x2015;Made Easy!</b><b><br></b>Fully updated for Java Platform, Standard Edition 11 (Java SE 11), <i>Java: A Beginner&#x2019;s Guide, Eighth Edition</i> gets you started programming in Java right away.

As scholar and cultural critic Tricia Rose argues, hip hop, in fact, has become one of the primary ways we talk about race in the United States. <br><br>But hip hop is in crisis. For years, the most commercially successful hip hop has become increasingly saturated with caricatures of black gangstas, thugs, pimps, and hos. This both represents and feeds a problem in black American culture. Or does it? In <i>The Hip-Hop Wars</i>, Rose explores the most crucial issues underlying the polarized claims on each side of the debate: Does hip hop cause violence, or merely reflect a violent ghetto culture? Is hip hop sexist, or are its detractors simply anti-sex? Does the portrayal of black culture in hip hop undermine black advancement?<br><br>A potent exploration of a divisive and important subject, <i>The Hip Hop Wars </i>concludes with a call for the regalvanization of the progressive and creative heart of hip hop. What Rose calls for is not a sanitized vision of the form, but one that more accurately reflects a much richer space of culture, politics, anger, and yes, sex, than the current ubiquitous images in sound and video currently provide.<br><br></p><p><b>Tricia Rose</b> is a professor of Africana Studies at Brown University. She specializes in twentieth- and twenty-first-century African-American culture and politics, social thought, popular culture, and gender issues. The author of the seminal <i>Black Noise</i>, she lives in Providence, Rhode Island."While the depth of Tricia Rose's analytical skills is breathtaking, even more impressive is that at its heart, <i>The Hip Hop Wars</i> is a hopeful, inspiring book that speaks to the necessity of a community-centered vision for justice for all."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Henry Louis Gates, Jr</b></i></b><br><br>"In <i>The Hip Hop Wars</i>, Tricia Rose has thrown down the gauntlet and taken up the brutal issues that confront hip hop culture. Dispatching hip hop's haters and sycophants with equal skill, she has given us a bracing and brilliant salvo from the front line of hip hop's war for definition and survival."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Michael Eric Dyson</b></i></b><br><br>"Tricia Rose is the distinguished dean of hip hop studies in America. Her recent book not only affirms this grand status but also transforms our understanding of the present and future of hip hop-and race-in America. Rose's courageous voice and progressive vision are so badly needed at this time!"&#x2015;<b><i><b>Cornel West</b></i></b><br><br>"A loving, smart, and searing critique from the pioneer of Hip Hop studies, <i>The Hip Hop Wars</i> breaks the impasse between those who always regarded the music as the source of our contemporary moral panic, and those hardcore defenders willing to justify anything in the name of 'keeping it real.' Tricia Rose not only brings sanity and intelligence to the debate, but at the back of every criticism, complaint, and concern is a social justice agenda. If you care about our future, read this book."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Robin D. G. Kelley, author of<i> Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Hip Hop Wars</i> is Crisis of the Negro Intellectual for the new millennium. Tricia Rose's take on hip hop is smart, provocative, analytical, and gutsy."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jill Nelson, author of <i>Volunteer Slavery: My Authentic Negro Experience</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Hip Hop Wars</i> is a conversation changing book. It gives music fans, political progressives, parents, pop culture aficionados and scholars what we need to put a stop to stupid arguments-and address what really matters when we talk about hip hop."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Lisa Duggan, author of <i>Twilight of Equality</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Works such as Rose's <i>The Hip Hop Wars</i>...based on a deep love for the music and a concern for the people who make it, listen to it, and care about it-we need a lot more of those." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Current Musicology</b></i></i></b><br><br>"[Tricia Rose is] a poetic voice of equanimity and strategic anger...Rose has the capacity to parse out the different threads of argument, examine them, and then tear them apart...The fact that she's traveling the middle path here, neither defending nor attacking hip hop, makes for a really nuanced, thought-provoking reading...It's harder to write when you're not making grand pronouncements and one-sided judgments. Rose does a beautiful job."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Feministing.com</b></i></i></b><br><br>"The book's clear strength is Rose's strong voice and tight research. Her exploration of the infamous Imus-gate, the effect of governmental policies such as incarceration over rehabilitation, and the question of what to expect from "role models" are all sound and compelling...Rose is definitely a fair critic."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Buffalo News</b></i></i></b><br><br>"Renowned cultural critic Rose ventures again into the world of hip-hop and produces another work that should challenge common feelings about the subject...It's Rose's convincing arguments and challenges of assumptions that make this an important title."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Library Journal</b></i></i></b></p><h2>Asian Tofu: Discover the Best, Make Your Own, and Cook It at Home [A Cookbook]</h2><p><p>From sleek, silken tofu with delicate toppings to piping-hot fried satchels in a robust sauce, tofu provides a versatile canvas for the intricate flavors and textures that Asian and vegetarian cooks have long enjoyed. America has embraced tofu as a healthy, affordable ingredient. And while it has been welcomed into sophisticated mainstream dining, tofu is often hidden in Western guises and in limited applications. In her third intrepid cookbook, celebrated food writer and teacher ANDREA NGUYEN aims to elevate this time-honored staple to a new place of prominence on every table. <br><br> <i>Asian</i> <i>Tofu</i>&#x2019;s nearly 100 recipes explore authentic,ancient fare and modern twists that capture the culinary spirit of East, Southeast, and South Asia. There are spectacular favorites from Japan, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and India, as well as delicious dishes from Taipei, San Francisco, Santa Monica, and New York. Andrea demystifies tofu and interprets traditional Asian cuisine for cooks, sharing compelling personal stories and dispatches from some of the world&#x2019;s best tofu artisans along the way.<br><br> For those who want to take their skills to the next level, the tofu tutorial clearly outlines tofu-making technique, encouraging readers to experiment with the unparalleled flavors of homemade varieties. But time-pressed cooks needn&#x2019;t fear: while a few recipes, such as Silken Tofu and Seasoned Soy Milk Hot Pot, are truly best with homemade tofu, most are terrific with store-bought products. Some traditional dishes combine tofu with meat in brilliant partnerships, such as Spicy Tofu with Beef and Sichuan Peppercorn and Tofu with Kimchi and Pork Belly, but this collection is predominantly vegetarian and vegan, including the pristinely flavored Spiced Tofu and Coconut in Banana Leaf and vibrant Spicy Lemongrass Tofu Salad. And innovations such as Okara Doughnuts reveal tofu&#x2019;s more playful side.<br><br> For health- and eco-conscious eaters and home chefs who are inspired to make the journey from bean to curd, <i>Asian Tofu</i> is the perfect guide.</p></p><p>Andrea Nguyen is one of the country&#x2019;s leading voices on Asian cuisine and the author of the acclaimed&nbsp;<i>Asian Dumplings</i>&nbsp;and the James Beard&#x2013; and IACP-nominated&nbsp;<i>Into the Vietnamese Kitchen</i>.

As an Asian staple, it is beloved by rich and poor alike. Whether fresh and tender or aged and fermented, tofu denotes basic sustenance, culinary craftsmanship, time-honored traditions, good health, and more. Tofu pervades many aspects of Asian life and culture, as I discovered during my travels and research for this book.<br><br> For example, visit a country in East or Southeast Asia and you&#x2019;ll see tofu practically everywhere, on restaurant menus, as street food, and at cafeterias. You can buy it from open-air (&#x201c;wet&#x201d;) food markets and neighborhood tofu shops as well as fancy food halls and superstores such as Walmart and Carrefour. Small packages of tofu snacks are often displayed as impulse buys at Chinese hypermarkets.<br><br> There are even ample opportunities for tofu tourism. A popular excursion from Taipei is to &#x201c;The Capital of Tofu&#x201d; in Shenkeng, renowned for its tender tofu and old-fashioned methods, such as cooking the soy milk over wood charcoal for a light smokiness. Under the archways that line the charming Old Town area, vendors sell a variety of tofu, including tofu ice cream, grilled stinky tofu on a stick, and salty-sweet fermented tofu. <br><br> Among the highlights of visiting Kyoto are elaborate multicourse tofu meals and tofu shops that date back to the 1800s. Tokyo offers elegant tofu fine dining restaurants, but in the outer stalls of the Tsukiji market, you&#x2019;ll come across the twenty-something Table-Mono tofu vendors hawking super rich soy milk, tofu, and ice cream to passersby.&nbsp; <br><br> Tofu is featured in many Asian cookbooks but it has also been spotlighted in comic books and children&#x2019;s books. It has inspired artists and designers to create posters, sculptures, and even tofu MP3 speakers and lamps! Few other foods can rival tofu&#x2019;s significance to so many people.<br><br><b> East Asian Stronghold<br></b><br> While people agree that tofu is an ancient food, no one is clear on when it was invented and by whom. Soybeans are native to China and were considered one of five sacred &#x201c;grains.&#x201d; As a primary foodstuff, the soybean&#x2019;s main virtues were its ability to grow well in poor soil without depleting the land, and its consistently high yield. The little bean was a useful famine food and the Chinese took to transforming it. Initially it was made into a type of gruel, and later into palatable staples such as soybean sprouts, soy sauce, and tofu. <br><br> Legend holds that King Liu An of Huainan invented tofu, and excavated tomb carvings point to tofu being made as early as the Han Dynasty (206 BCE&#x2013;220 CE). Scholars also suggest that the Han Chinese may have learned about rendering curds from milk through contact with nomads from the northern steppes. However, tofu did not catch on as a popular, commercially made food until the tenth century, when the Mandarin term <i>dou fu</i> (tofu) was mentioned numerous times in literature.<br><br> It was from the Song Dynasty (960&#x2013;1279 CE) onward that tofu spread to other parts of the region. Wherever the Chinese exerted their influence, whether through religion, politics, or trade, tofu went with them. That&#x2019;s why so many Asian tofu dishes are Chinese in origin.<br><br> How tofu knowledge flowed from China to other cultures, however, is murky. For example, monks and scholars traveling between China and Japan may have transmitted tofu culture to Japan between the eighth and twelfth centuries. It was first mentioned in Japan in 1183 as a Shinto shrine offering, but the characters as we know them today were not written in Japan until 1489. What is generally agreed upon is that tofu was not part of everyday Japanese eating until the middle of the Edo Period (1603&#x2013;1868). Some support the theory that the Japanese learned about tofu from the Koreans, as a result of the Japanese invasions of Korea between 1592 and 1598. In any event, Japan took to tofu in a big way, evidenced by the 1782 bestseller <i>Tofu Hyaku Chin</i> by Ka Hitsujun. Among the book&#x2019;s one hundred tofu recipes are enduring classics, such as <i>hiya yakk</i>o (chilled tofu; page 51) and <i>yu dofu</i> (simmered tofu; page 87).<br><br> Korea and China share a border, and tofu was likely introduced to Korea in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Historic records show that it even played a role in diplomacy. In 1434, as part of their tribute relationship, the Chinese emperor requested Korean cooks skilled at making dubu (tofu) preparations. By the fifteenth century, tofu had indeed become widespread in Korea, though it was mostly made by Buddhist monks as temple food. It was part of an annual ceremony to memorialize the deceased, a practice that continues today.<br><br><b> Wavering Southeast Asia <br></b><br> Vietnam was also a major player in China&#x2019;s tribute system and a Chinese colony for a millennium, from 111 BCE to 939 CE. Additionally, Vietnamese Buddhism is closely aligned with Chinese Buddhism. Given all of those factors, Vietnam stands out among the Southeast Asian countries as having a broad array of tofu (<i>dau phu</i> or <i>dau hu</i>) dishes, including Chinese favorites and many native preparations, such as Lemongrass Tofu with Chiles (page 108). The Vietnamese also developed an extensive vegetarian repertoire that included tofu-based mock meats and fake fish sauce.<br><br> While tofu is present in other parts of Southeast and South Asia, it is not a huge deal. According to Thai food authority David Thompson, tofu was a latecomer to the Thai table: &#x201c;Bean curd is a Chinese import and stayed in that community up until the 1930s when the Chinese and their food became more accepted in Thailand. And so such a relatively short time has meant very little use in pure Thai food.&#x201d; <br><br> While tofu may be added to curries as a meat substitute, included in simple stir-fries and added to noodle dishes, the Thai repertoire includes few tofu-centric preparations. In general, tofu is treated in a Chinese manner, such as being deep-fried and eaten with sauce, or it plays supporting role, as exemplified in pad Thai (page 184). The fermented tofu preparation (<i>lon tao hu yi</i>, page 148) is an unusual dish that presents tofu in a Thai manner.<br><br> People living in Cambodia and Laos enjoy tofu dishes that are often borrowed from Chinese traditions. However, they also invent some of their own, such as the Hmong poached chicken and tofu meatballs on page 129.<br><br> In multicultural and multireligious Singapore and Malaysia, treats such as grilled stuffed tofu pockets (page 67) satisfy the dietary needs of Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, and others. While tempeh (fermented soybeans) is king in mostly Muslim Indonesia, tofu is a strong runner-up in terms of popular soy-based foods. Indonesia was part of the spice trade route, which explains original creations such as twice-cooked <i>tahu bacem</i> (page 112) from Java. <br><br> The Chinese brought tofu to the Philippines but locals didn&#x2019;t adapt it to their cuisine in a significant way. Filipino cookbooks rarely include tofu recipes. As contribution to my research, freelance writer and food blogger Tracey Paska informally polled relatives and tofu vendors at the popular Cubao wet market in Metro Manila. She asked them to name Filipino tofu preparations. Aside from <i>tokwa&#x2019;t baboy</i>, a dish of fried tofu, boiled pork, and vinegary soy sauce, people could not name any other traditional dishes that featured tofu. However, Chinese Sweet Tofu Pudding with Ginger Syrup (page 195) is a very popular snack. <br><br> Myanmar (formerly Burma) is something of a rogue tofu country. Burmese cooks employ a different kind of tofu. Irene Khin Wong, the owner of Saffron 59 Catering in New York City, explained that soybean-based tofu is a Chinese import that endures in her native country. However, the prevailing and more popular Burmese tofu (also called Shan tofu) is made from ground legumes that are cooked in a polenta-like manner and then cooled and cut. Tofu can be made from many kinds of legumes, including lentils and peanuts, but this book focuses on the soybean version. <br><br><b> South Asian Newcomer<br></b><br> Although soybeans had long been a minor crop in India, tofu didn&#x2019;t arrive until 1976 when a tofu shop was established near Auroville, an experimental utopia in southwest India. According to the SoyInfo Center, Westerners made that tofu. <br><br> Renowned author and teacher Julie Sahni explained that India was a late tofu adopter because initially soy milk and soybean curd were presented as substitutes for cow&#x2019;s milk and paneer. While Indians who had contact with the Chinese were open to those soybean products, many others took offense at the notion that a bean could replace the precious foods produced from cows, revered and sacred animals in their culture. &#x201c;It was too close for comfort, too competitive, and very difficult to accept,&#x201d; she said. <br><br> Much had changed by 1985, Sahni noted in <i>Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking</i>, as tofu was gaining popularity in India as a protein-rich, healthy substitute for traditional paneer cheese. Many Indian cooks have picked up on tofu since then. The saag tofu and cashew and tofu fudge recipes (pages 121 and 201) demonstrate how some people integrate tofu into traditional preparations. Today, India is the world&#x2019;s fifth largest producer of soybeans. <br><br><b> Tofu in America<br></b><br> I was born in Vietnam but grew up in America, and tofu was regularly on our family&#x2019;s table, a natural extension of my Asian heritage. This isn&#x2019;t the case for most Americans, despite the soybean&#x2019;s long history in the United States.&nbsp; <br><br> British colonist Samuel Bowen planted the first soybeans in Savannah, Georgia, in 1765 and made his own soy sauce. A few years later, Benjamin Franklin sent seeds from London to a botanist in Philadelphia, citing Italian friar Domingo Navarette&#x2019;s 1665 account of Chinese tofu. By the 1850s, Midwestern farmers were cultivating soybeans from Japanese seeds, thanks to precocious travelers and Commodore Matthew Perry&#x2019;s historic expedition and trade mission to Japan. <br><br> Though some Americans experimented with eating soybeans during the 1800s, people mostly knew only of soy sauce. The US soybean crop was mainly used to feed animals and enrich soil with nitrogen. However, Americans turned to soy as a source of nourishment during wartime and periods of deprivation. For example, Civil War soldiers in the southern states drank a coffee substitute made from ground roasted soybeans. <br><br> In the early part of the twentieth century, the USDA sent expeditions to Asia to investigate traditional soy foods and growing methods. Agricultural explorers Charles Piper and William Morse detailed their findings in <i>The Soybean</i> (1923), a historic publication that included recipes to encourage Americans to consume soy foods. Innovators George Washington Carver and Henry Ford both championed soybeans for cooking and also collaborated on developing soy-based plastics. Ford hosted multicourse soybean feasts and developed an experimental &#x201c;Soybean Car.&#x201d; <br><br> Mildred Lager&#x2019;s <i>The Useful Soybean</i> (1945) presented well-researched and impassioned arguments for adopting soybeans as a natural food. Unfortunately, her efforts did not alter prevailing attitudes toward the bean. Americans still perceived it as a nonfood, though they indirectly consumed it via livestock raised on soybean meal, vegetable oil, and other processed foods. During and after World War II, farmers in the US began cultivating soy as a major cash crop, turning it into one of country&#x2019;s most important agricultural commodities. America is currently among the world&#x2019;s biggest soybean producers and exporters. <br><br><b> From Alternative to Mainstream<br></b><br> In 1958, Boys Market in Los Angeles became the first American supermarket to sell tofu. However, tofu did not get a real boost in the US until the 1970s, when it became part of the natural foods and sustainable eating movement. Frances Moore Lappe&#x2019;s <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i> (1971) and William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi&#x2019;s <i>The Book of Tofu</i> (1975) detailed the ecological, health, and culinary benefits of tofu. <br><br> Shurtleff and Aoyagi&#x2019;s work encouraged people to make tofu and prepare vegetarian fare. Their extensive exploration of Japanese tofu shops and cuisine underscored how tofu was an efficient means to use the Earth&#x2019;s natural resources. &#x201c;I wanted to make a contribution to the planet,&#x201d; Shurtleff explained in a 2010 conversation. Organic tofu pioneer Jeremiah Ridenour, who traveled with Shurtleff and Aoyagi in the 1970s and eventually cofounded Wildwood Natural Foods, succinctly put it this way: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about feeding the world. We have to be eating at the beginning of the food chain.&#x201d; Tofu activists such as Shurtleff and entrepreneurs such as Ridenour helped reframe tofu for their generation. As a result, tofu took on a New Age aura of Asian trendiness and organic living. Before that, the American tofu scene remained in the realm of Asian American&#x2013;owned tofu shops and vegetarian Seventh-day Adventists. The economic upheaval of the 1970s gave way to the boom years of Reaganomics, and many of the Americans who tasted tofu in the guise of Western fare disliked it. In fact, a 1986 Roper Poll published in <i>USA Today</i> listed tofu as the nation&#x2019;s most loathed food.&nbsp; <br><br> Burdened with a &#x201c;bland white cake in water&#x201d; image, tofu got a marketing makeover in the 1990s as manufacturers answered consumers&#x2019; call for healthy foods. Nondairy Western products such as Tofutti ice cream and tofu chocolate Americanized tofu and converted many skeptics. In 1990, <i>The Tofu Book</i> by John Paino and Lisa Messinger declared tofu the foundation for a new American cuisine. <br><br> The Los Angeles Tofu Festival debuted in 1996 and had a successful run until 2007, attracting thousands of people annually with clever themes and taglines such as &#x201c;Tofuzilla&#x201d; and &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hip to be square.&#x201d; Over the past decades, tofu publications, better awareness of Asian cultures, and robust Asian American communities have contributed to greater appreciation for tofu as a healthy, affordable food source. <br><br><b> Tofu Today</b><br> In a 2008 survey of 1,000 adults, the United Soybean Board found that 85 percent of Americans understand that soy is healthy, a 26-point rise since 1997. The USDA&#x2019;s recently released 2010 dietary guidelines recommended soy products and soy milk as part of a good diet. On the flip side, there are many who believe that too much soy is harmful to health. Indeed, overconsuming anything can lead to adverse side effects. A wise strategy is to enjoy moderate amounts of minimally processed, natural soy foods, such as tofu, soy sauce, and miso. <br><br> That&#x2019;s easier nowadays because tofu can be found at most supermarkets and specialty grocers. Tofu makers such as Hodo Soy (page 131) are expanding people&#x2019;s palate for tofu and Dong Phuong Tofu (page 193) are preserving tofu traditions for their immigrant communities. The menus of Japanese <i>izakaya</i> pubs showcase fresh tofu to appreciative diners. At the same time, curious home cooks and chefs are beginning to experiment with making tofu from scratch.&nbsp; <br><br> Tofu is no longer either relegated to food co-ops or considered as a mere mea...</p><h2>The Queen&#39;s Fool</h2><p>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and &#x201c;queen of royal fiction&#x201d; (<i>USA TODAY</i>) Philippa Gregory weaves a spellbinding tale of a young woman with the ability to see the future in an era when destiny was anything but clear.<br><br>Winter, 1553.

Her stepmother, seated in an arbor with Rosamund roses in bud all around her, caught sight of the fourteen-year-old girl and the handsome man chasing around the broad tree trunks on the smooth turf and smiled, determined to see only the best in both of them: the girl she was bringing up and the man she had adored for years. </p><p> He snatched at the hem of the girl's swinging gown and caught her up to him for a moment. "A forfeit!" he said, his dark face close to her flushed cheeks. </p><p> They both knew what the forfeit would be. Like quicksilver she slid from his grasp and dodged away, to the far side of an ornamental fountain with a broad circular bowl. Fat carp were swimming slowly in the water; Elizabeth's excited face was reflected in the surface as she leaned forward to taunt him. </p><p> "Can't catch me!" </p><p> " 'Course I can." </p><p> She leaned low so that he could see her small breasts at the top of the square-cut green gown. She felt his eyes on her and the color in her cheeks deepened. He watched, amused and aroused, as her neck flushed rosy pink. </p><p> "I can catch you any time I want to," he said, thinking of the chase of sex that ends in bed. </p><p> "Come on then!" she said, not knowing exactly what she was inviting, but knowing that she wanted to hear his feet pounding the grass behind her, sense his hands outstretched to grab at her; and, more than anything else, to feel his arms around her, pulling her against the fascinating contours of his body, the scratchy embroidery of his doublet against her cheek, the press of his thigh against her legs. </p><p> She gave a little scream and dashed away again down an <i>all�e</i> of yew trees, where the Chelsea garden ran down to the river. The queen, smiling, looked up from her sewing and saw her beloved stepdaughter racing between the trees, her handsome husband a few easy strides behind. She looked down again at her sewing and did not see him catch Elizabeth, whirl her around, put her back to the red papery bark of the yew tree and clamp his hand over her half-open mouth. </p><p> Elizabeth's eyes blazed black with excitement, but she did not struggle. When he realized that she would not scream, he took his hand away and bent his dark head. </p><p> Elizabeth felt the smooth sweep of his moustache against her lips, smelled the heady scent of his hair, his skin. She closed her eyes and tipped back her head to offer her lips, her neck, her breasts to his mouth. When she felt his sharp teeth graze her skin, she was no longer a giggling child, she was a young woman in the heat of first desire. </p><p> Gently he loosened his grip on her waist, and his hand stole up the firmly boned stomacher to the neck of her gown, where he could slide a finger down inside her linen to touch her breasts. Her nipple was hard and aroused; when he rubbed it she gave a little mew of pleasure that made him laugh at the predictability of female desire, a deep chuckle in the back of his throat. </p><p> Elizabeth pressed herself against the length of his body, feeling his thigh push forward between her legs in reply. She had a sensation like an overwhelming curiosity. She longed to know what might happen next. </p><p> When he made a movement away from her, as if to release her, she wound her arms around his back and pulled him into her again. She felt rather than saw Tom Seymour's smile of pleasure at her culpability, as his mouth came down on hers again and his tongue licked, as delicate as a cat, against the side of her mouth. Torn between disgust and desire at the extraordinary sensation, she slid her own tongue to meet his and felt the terrible intimacy of a grown man's intrusive kiss. </p><p> All at once it was too much for her, and she shrank back from him, but he knew the rhythm of this dance which she had so lightheartedly invoked, and which would now beat through her very veins. He caught at the hem of her brocade skirt and pulled it up and up until he could get at her, sliding his practiced hand up her thighs, underneath her linen shift. Instinctively she clamped her legs together against his touch until he brushed, with calculated gentleness, the back of his hand on her hidden sex. At the teasing touch of his knuckles, she melted; he could feel her almost dissolve beneath him. She would have fallen if he had not had a firm arm around her waist, and he knew at that moment that he could have the king's own daughter, Princess Elizabeth, against a tree in the queen's garden. The girl was a virgin in name alone. In reality, she was little more than a whore. </p><p> A light step on the path made him quickly turn, dropping Elizabeth's gown and putting her behind him, out of sight. Anyone could read the tranced willingness on the girl's face; she was lost in her desire. He was afraid it was the queen, his wife, whose love for him was insulted every day that he seduced her ward under her very nose: the queen, who had been entrusted with the care of her stepdaughter the princess, Queen Katherine who had sat at Henry VIII's deathbed but dreamed of this man. </p><p> But it was not the queen who stood before him on the path. It was only a girl, a little girl of about nine years old, with big solemn dark eyes and a white Spanish cap tied under her chin. She carried two books strapped with bookseller's tape in her hand, and she regarded him with a cool objective interest, as if she had seen and understood everything. </p><p> "How now, sweetheart!" he exclaimed, falsely cheerful. "You gave me a start. I might have thought you a fairy, appearing so suddenly." </p><p> She frowned at his rapid, overloud speech, and then she replied, very slowly with a strong Spanish accent, "Forgive me, sir. My father told me to bring these books to Sir Thomas Seymour and they said you were in the garden." </p><p> She proffered the package of books, and Tom Seymour was forced to step forward and take them from her hands. "You're the bookseller's daughter," he said cheerfully. "The bookseller from Spain." </p><p> She bowed her head in assent, not taking her dark scrutiny from his face. </p><p> "What are you staring at, child?" he asked, conscious of Elizabeth, hastily rearranging her gown behind him. </p><p> "I was looking at you, sir, but I saw something most dreadful." </p><p> "What?" he demanded. For a moment he was afraid she would say that she had seen him with the Princess of England backed up against a tree like a common doxy, her skirt pulled up out of the way and his fingers dabbling at her purse. </p><p> "I saw a scaffold behind you," said the surprising child, and then turned and walked away as if she had completed her errand and there was nothing more for her to do in the sunlit garden. </p><p> Tom Seymour whirled back to Elizabeth, who was trying to comb her disordered hair with fingers that were still shaking with desire. At once she stretched out her arms to him, wanting more. </p><p> "Did you hear that?" </p><p> Elizabeth's eyes were slits of black. "No," she said silkily. "Did she say something?" </p><p> "She only said that she saw the scaffold behind me!" He was more shaken than he wanted to reveal. He tried for a bluff laugh, but it came out with a quaver of fear. </p><p> At the mention of the scaffold Elizabeth was suddenly alert. "Why?" she snapped. "Why should she say such a thing?" </p><p> "God knows," he said. "Stupid little witch. Probably mistook the word, she's foreign. Probably meant throne! Probably saw the throne behind me!" </p><p> But this joke was no more successful than his bluster, since in Elizabeth's imagination the throne and the scaffold were always close neighbors. The color drained from her face, leaving her sallow with fear. </p><p> "Who is she?" Her voice was sharp with nervousness. "Who is she working for?" </p><p> He turned to look for the child but the <i>all�e</i> was empty. At the distant end of it he could see his wife walking slowly toward them, her back arched to carry the pregnant curve of her belly. </p><p> "Not a word," he said quickly to the girl at his side. "Not a word of this, sweetheart. You don't want to upset your stepmother." </p><p> He hardly needed to warn her. At the first hint of danger the girl was wary, smoothing her dress, conscious always that she must play a part, that she must survive. He could always rely on Elizabeth's duplicity. She might be only fourteen but she had been trained in deceit every day since the death of her mother, she had been an apprentice cheat for twelve long years. And she was the daughter of a liar -- two liars, he thought spitefully. She might feel desire; but she was always more alert to danger or ambition than to lust. He took her cold hand and led her up the <i>all�e</i> toward his wife Katherine. He tried for a merry smile. "I caught her at last!" he called out. </p><p> He glanced around, he could not see the child anywhere. "We had such a race!" he cried. </p><p> I was that child, and that was the first sight I ever had of the Princess Elizabeth: damp with desire, panting with lust, rubbing herself like a cat against another woman's husband. But it was the first and last time I saw Tom Seymour. Within a year, he was dead on the scaffold charged with treason, and Elizabeth had denied three times having anything more than the most common acquaintance with him. </p><p> Copyright � 2004 by Philippa Gregory Limited</p></p><h2>The Two-Family House: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>"An emotional but dreamy novel that...will transport you far, far away from your next dreary Monday morning.

You will never be alone. We are dancing for you." So begins Cutcha Risling Baldy's deeply personal account of the revitalization of the women's coming-of-age ceremony for the Hoopa Valley Tribe. At the end of the twentieth century, the tribe's Flower Dance had not been fully practiced for decades. The women of the tribe, recognizing the critical importance of the tradition, undertook its revitalization using the memories of elders and medicine women and details found in museum archives, anthropological records, and oral histories.<br><br>Deeply rooted in Indigenous knowledge, Risling Baldy brings us the voices of people transformed by cultural revitalization, including the accounts of young women who have participated in the Flower Dance. Using a framework of Native feminisms, she locates this revival within a broad context of decolonizing praxis and considers how this renaissance of women's coming-of-age ceremonies confounds ethnographic depictions of Native women; challenges anthropological theories about menstruation, gender, and coming-of-age; and addresses gender inequality and gender violence within Native communities.</p><p>Cutcha Risling Baldy is assistant professor of Native American studies at Humboldt University and a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe."A truly significant contribution to the field exploring Indigenous approaches to menstruation and the meaning of womanhood. That it is grounded in the particular culture of the author makes it all the more valuable and unique."&#x2015;Kim Anderson, author of <i>Life Stages and Native Women: Memory, Teachings, and Story Medicine</i><p>"I am in awe . . . Risling Baldy's interventions into the field are many and absolutely necessary. <i>We Are Dancing for You</i> is located in a place, in the lives of a community where the voices of individual women are heard, as is the author's. [This book] locates its authority in community knowledge and language. It pushes back against the outside, primarily white male ethnographic professional as authority."&#x2015;Dian Million (Tanana), author of <i>Therapeutic Nations: Healing in an Age of Indigenous Human Rights</i></p><p>"Part meticulous research, part spiritual journey, and fully in the heart of cultural re-invention, <i>We Are Dancing for You</i> does work that cherishes, educates, celebrates, and enriches our future generations with the knowledge that yes, our bodies are the archive, and the archive is alive and singing."&#x2015;Deborah A. Miranda, (Ohlone Costanoan Esselen Nation / Chumash), author of <i>Bad Indians: A Tribal Memoir</i></p><p>"Cutcha Risling Baldy's research on the Hupa flower dance is important feminist and Indigenous scholarship as she is not only approaching the subject as a key insider, but she is also exploring what it means in the larger continuum of Hupa epistemologies and ontologies. While this could easily and beautifully linger in the ethnographic realm of scholarship or in the more common California Indian Studies sphere of examining the devastating consequences of colonization and genocide in California, Ms. Baldy instead magnificently pushes the analysis further by developing a Hupa feminist methodology. She models the political possibilities in reviving the dances that are geared especially toward woman. This tribally specific work and her analysis reaches beyond Northern California and into other Indigenous groups who are working to decolonize structures by regaining healthy gendered elements of tribal life and activist work. These insights are key to our understandings of cultural production, gender, and revitalization and vital to understanding solutions for California Indian communities."&#x2015;Mishauna Goeman, (Tonawanda Band of Seneca), author of <i>Mark My Words: Native Women (Re)mapping Our Nations</i></p></p><h2>QUANTUM GLORY: The Science Of Heaven Invading Earth</h2><p>Quantum Glory explores the intriguing intersection between the two realities of quantum mechanics and the glory of God.Quantum Glory consists of page after page of revelation as to the glory of God and the wonders of the universe.

His blond locks and his ornate crown&#x2014;a wreath of gilded evergreen branches&#x2014;seemed to glow. Even the sun wanted to touch him.<br> <br>For all of her thirteen years, Lila had been just as enamored of him.<br> <br>Off to the side, whispers sounded from her backstabbing royal cousins.<br> <br>&#x201c;Saetth&#x2019;s about to behead his child fianc�e!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The foulmouthed brat got used to being the king&#x2019;s favorite.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why isn&#x2019;t the little bitch crying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or begging for her cursed life?&#x201d;<br> <br>Crying or begging? As if. Lila faced Saetth with her chin up and shoulders back, her pampered appearance belying her fortitude.<br> <br>The perils of this fey court had honed her mettle. Learning from the mistakes of others had sharpened her acumen.<br> <br>Yet nothing could stifle her unfeylike temper; after all, she&#x2019;d been betrothed to Saetth since her birth, raised to become the queen of this realm. Rumor even held that she was a princess reincarnated.<br> <br>Fate wanted her to be a queen.<br> <br>Lila had worn a purple silk gown for this occasion; the color was royal&#x2014;and defiant.<br> <br>As the castle&#x2019;s clock tower tolled, Saetth finished cleaning the weapon he always carried, the Ancestors&#x2019; Sword, the unifying symbol of their royal line. He raised the blade to the sunlight, eyeing the edge with his piercing blue gaze.<br> <br>Her earliest memories were of sighing over his handsome face, imagining him as her husband and her dollies as the subjects they protected.<br> <br>Yet now her king suspected Lila of treason?<br> <br>How could her coldhearted parents have plotted against such a powerful ruler? They&#x2019;d foolishly trusted an informer, leaving their only child&#x2019;s life hanging in the balance.<br> <br>Secrecy equals survival in this court.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d never cared about her&#x2014;never pretended she was more than a valuable bargaining chip&#x2014;which was one of the reasons she&#x2019;d bonded so strongly with Saetth, who&#x2019;d at least shown her attention. . . .<br> <br>He sheathed his sword. Peering down at her, he began her trial with one question: &#x201c;Why shouldn&#x2019;t I believe you were involved in your parents&#x2019; plot to steal my crown?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lila pinned his gaze with her own uncanny one. Her defense consisted of eight words: &#x201c;Because it still sits upon your godsdamned head.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stunned silence reigned.<br> <br>Saetth&#x2019;s shock turned to amusement. &#x201c;And that is why you remain my betrothed, Calliope of Sylvan, the queen of my heart.&#x201d; He laughed, his gaze seemingly warm. &#x201c;If there was ever a girl born to rule, you are she, cousin. But I too was born to rule, and I&#x2019;ve kept this crown for millennia because I allow no threats to fester around me.&#x201d; His smile disappeared as if it&#x2019;d never been. &#x201c;I hereby exile you from our woodland kingdom.&#x201d;<br> <br>Leave her beloved Sylvan? Lila would almost rather die. The forests were what separated the Sylvans from the other fey. The splendor of those great trees was equaled only by the shining, meticulous order of life at court.<br> <br>Just two weeks ago, at a ball in her honor, the lights from a thousand candles had reflected in her jewels as Saetth had led her out to dance. The next day she&#x2019;d run through the woods alongside bounding deer.<br> <br>Separating her from this place would be like draining her veins of blood. &#x201c;To where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The mortal realm.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gasps sounded; some of her cousins tittered. He might as well have sentenced her to hell.<br> <br>She would go from proudly displaying everything that made her a Lorean to hiding her very species from prying mortal eyes. From the order the fey so cherished to human chaos.<br> <br>Saetth said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see if my hothouse rose can survive among primitive humans.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lips drawn back from her teeth, she said, &#x201c;Careful, cousin, this hothouse rose intends to flourish and grow sharp thorns.&#x201d;<br> <br>More gasps.<br> <br>Saetth&#x2019;s eyes flickered with excitement. He leaned down and said, &#x201c;I am counting on it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if the fey-slayer finds me, what then?&#x201d; Rune Darklight, a homicidal archer and one of the M�ri�r, was murdering the Sylvan line of succession. Lila was one of only fourteen left.<br> <br>This castle had a barrier to keep M�ri�r out; she&#x2019;d be vulnerable anywhere else.<br> <br>&#x201c;Test your new thorns against him,&#x201d; Saetth said. As if any of the monstrous M�ri�r could be fought! &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re truly the queen I deserve, you&#x2019;ll figure out something, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long until I can return?&#x201d; Six months? A year?<br> <br>&#x201c;Should there come a time when you can prove your loyalty to me through great personal sacrifice, I will provide you the chance to take your rightful place by my side.

If you want to understand this central quality of human nature to its roots, read <i>Why We Love</i>." </b><br> &#x2015;<b>Edward O. Wilson</b></p><p> In <i>Why We Love</i>, renowned anthropologist Helen Fisher offers a new map of the phenomenon of love&#x2015;from its origins in the brain to the thrilling havoc it creates in our bodies and behavior. Working with a team of scientists to scan the brains of people who had just fallen madly in love, Fisher proved what psychologists had until recently only suspected: when you fall in love, specific areas of the brain "light up" with increased blood flow. This sweeping new book uses this data to argue that romantic passion is hardwired into our brains by millions of years of evolution. It is not an emotion; it is a drive as powerful as hunger. </p><p>Provocative, enlightening, engaging, and persuasive, <i>Why We Love</i> offers radical new answers to age-old questions: what love is, who we love&#x2015;and how to keep love alive.</p></p><p><p><b>Helen Fisher, Ph.D</b>., is one of this country's most prominent anthropologists. Prior to becoming a research professor at Rutgers University, she was a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Fisher has conducted extensive research on the evolution, expression, and chemistry of love. Her two previous books, <i>The First Sex </i>and <i>The Anatomy of Love</i>, were<i> New York Times </i>Notable Books. She grew up in Connecticut and lives in New York City.</p>From <i>Why We Love:</i><br><br>All of our basic drives are exceedingly difficult to control. It is impossible to sublimate or redirect thirst or hunger. It is difficult to quell the maternal instinct. And it is very tough to control one&#x2019;s persistent craving for a sweetheart. We need food. We need water. We need salt. We need warmth. And the lover needs the beloved. Plato had it right over two thousand years ago. The God of Love &#x201c;lives in a state of need.&#x201d; Romantic love is a need; it is a fundamental human drive.<br><br>The drive to love has produced some of humankind&#x2019;s most compelling operas, plays, and novels, our most touching poems and haunting melodies, the world&#x2019;s finest sculptures and paintings, and our most colorful festivals, myths, and legends. Love has adorned the world and brought many of us tremendous joy. But this passion is fickle. When love is scorned, it can cause excruciating sorrow. Romantic rejection, crimes of passion, and high divorce and adultery rates are prevalent in societies around the world. <br><br>Romantic love is one of the most intense of all human experiences; blissful when it is requited; devastating when it is spurned. I think it is time for a serious attempt to answer Shakespeare&#x2019;s question: &#x201c;What &#x2018;tis to love?&#x201d;<br></p><h2>Sharks in the Rivers</h2><p>The speaker in this extraordinary collection finds herself multiply dislocated: from her childhood in California, from her family&#x2019;s roots in Mexico, from a dying parent, from her prior self. The world is always in motion both toward and away from us and it is also full of risk: from sharks unexpectedly lurking beneath estuarial rivers to the dangers of New York City, where, as Lim�n reminds us, even rats find themselves trapped by the garbage cans they&#x2019;ve crawled into. In such a world, how should one proceed? Throughout <i>Sharks in the Rivers</i>, Lim�n suggests that we must cleave to the world as it keep[s] opening before us,&#x201d; for, if we pay attention, we can be one with its complex, ephemeral, and beautiful strangeness. Loss is perpetual, and each person&#x2019;s mouth is the same / mouth as everyone&#x2019;s, all trying to say the same thing.&#x201d; For Lim�n, it&#x2019;s the saying individual and collective that transforms each of us into a wound overcome by wonder,&#x201d; that allows the wind itself&#x201d; to be our own wild whisper.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>How to Train Your Dragon: How to Ride a Dragon&#39;s Storm (How to Train Your Dragon, 7)</h2><p>Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, everyone&#39;s favorite reluctant Viking hero, has three months, five days and six hours to discover America, get back to Berk, save his father, battle Polarserpents, and win the annual Inter-Tribal Friendly Swimming Race.

Elaine had died nearly six months earlier, and the restaurant couldn&#x2019;t make it without her. This was its last night.</p><p>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Dino said, gazing at the mob jammed into the place, &#x201c;if half these people had had dinner here once a week after she died, this joint would still be thriving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;but I guess the place could never be the same without Elaine to hold it together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I feel sorry for the writers,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t another joint in town that gives the best tables to writers. They&#x2019;ll be wandering up and down Second Avenue, looking for someplace to eat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And think of all the book deals that won&#x2019;t get made here,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Where else do writers and publishers mingle?&#x201d;</p><p>All the tables had temporary tops that seated ten people, and Stone and Dino were jammed against the wall, so close to the next table that if they wanted to get to the men&#x2019;s room, they would have to stand on their chairs and walk across the table. There were two hundred people lined up on Second Avenue, waiting to get in.</p><p>Bill Eggers, the managing partner of Stone&#x2019;s law firm, Woodman &amp; Weld, spoke up from across the table. &#x201c;Never mind the writers,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;where are you two guys going to eat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;There just isn&#x2019;t another place in the city that has what Elaine&#x2019;s had. Forty-eight years she was here.&#x201d;</p><p>Somebody with a video cam elbowed his way up to the table and panned around the group. Herbie Fisher and his girl and Bob Cantor and his wife were there. Holly Barker had flown up from Washington for the occasion and was staying with Stone. The cameraman moved on. Stone looked around and saw plenty of regulars: Gay Talese, Frederic Morton, David Black, Nick Taylor, Carol Higgins Clark&#x2014;all writers; photographers Harry Benson and Jessica Burstein were taking pictures; Alec Baldwin, with shaggy hair and a full beard, had found a video cam somewhere and was using it; Josh Gaspero, retired publisher, and his Thursday-night regulars were at their regular table. Gianni and Frank, the headwaiters, and all the waiters, were still there; none had left for another job before the end.</p><p>It was just like every other night at Elaine&#x2019;s, except for the three hundred extra people.</p><p>Stone had ordered the most expensive wines, because he knew Elaine would have loved that.

Stone was still watching her a moment later when she was stopped by a man who had planted himself in her path. He leaned over and shouted above the din into her ear. She drew back her right hand and punched him squarely in the face. He fell, scattering drinkers, and Stone could have sworn she stepped on him as she continued out the door.</p><p>The man was helped to his feet, swearing, his nose bloody, shouting unpleasant descriptions of the redhead to anyone who would listen.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you see that?&#x201d; Holly asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She looked familiar. Do you know her?&#x201d;</p><p>Stone shook his head. &#x201c;Nope, I don&#x2019;t know any redheads.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe she wasn&#x2019;t always a redhead,&#x201d; Holly said.</p><p>&#x201c;Who knows? I don&#x2019;t know three-quarters of the people in here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get a look at her face,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;but I know the guy she knocked down, name of Billy Gaston, ex-cop, now a PI. Nasty piece of work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never heard of him,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;He was a street cop, made detective after you left. He was on the take from all sorts of people. The brass couldn&#x2019;t prove it, but everybody knew it. He was told he might be happier in civilian life, and he took the hint.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She really slugged him, didn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; Stone laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;And I really enjoyed it,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>STONE AND Holly staggered into his house in Turtle Bay and took the elevator upstairs, necking all the way. Leaving a trail of clothing, they made their way into the bedroom to be greeted by a persistently ringing telephone. Stone looked at the instrument. His third line was ringing, the one that the answering machine didn&#x2019;t pick up. Stone pressed the speaker button and fell into bed beside Holly.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Dino.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You son of a bitch,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;you knew I&#x2019;d have to pick up line three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;I want you to listen to something. It&#x2019;s important.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Listen to something? What are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just shut up and listen.&#x201d; There were noises, then Stone could clearly hear a female voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Dino,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s Shelley. Well, not anymore, but you wouldn&#x2019;t recognize my new name. I saw you at Elaine&#x2019;s tonight. Sad, isn&#x2019;t it? The first time I was ever in the place, and it was the last night. You and Stone and Holly seemed to be having a good time, but I could tell you were a little depressed. Who were all the other people at your table? Regulars, I guess. Well, it&#x2019;s late, and I&#x2019;d better let you get to bed. I may be in town for a little while, so I&#x2019;ll call again. Maybe we can actually talk.&#x201d; There was a click.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>Stone, Dino, and Holly had spent a lot of time in Washington, D.C., the previous summer while Dino and Stone investigated a year-old murder and a suicide, which turned into a string of five murders, all women. Turned out, the murderer had been in their midst all along.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy shit!&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;Shelley is in New York?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to do about it, Dino?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell can I do about it?&#x201d; Dino asked.</p><p>&#x201c;The woman is a serial killer,&#x201d; Stone reminded him. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t ignore this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you suggest?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You might keep that recording for later,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll do that. What else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I&#x2019;m stumped, too. If I were you, I&#x2019;d give Kerry Smith at the FBI a call tomorrow morning and tell him about this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll do that, then I&#x2019;ll forget about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sleep tight,&#x201d; Stone said, then pushed the speaker button again to disconnect.</p><p>&#x201c;So she&#x2019;s still out there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shhhhh,&#x201d; Stone said, kissing her, then he moved on to other things.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>STONE WOKE at his usual seven a.m., but worse than usual for the wear. &#x201c;Groan,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Holly stirred beside him. &#x201c;Groan here, too. What were we drinking last night?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bourbon and Dom P�rignon,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;and I think there was some red wine in between.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My head remembers them all,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;Aspirin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In your medicine cabinet,&#x201d; he replied, and Holly padded across the bedroom to her bathroom. &#x201c;Bring me three,&#x201d; Stone called out. &#x201c;And some water.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly returned with the aspirin bottle and a glass of water, and they both partook.</p><p>&#x201c;A good breakfast will chase away the hangover,&#x201d; Stone said, picking up the phone and buzzing Helene, his housekeeper. He ordered eggs scrambled with cheese, bacon, English muffins, orange juice, and coffee, then hung up.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank God we don&#x2019;t have to fix breakfast,&#x201d; Holly said.</p><p>&#x201c;Or go out for it. Dino does that every day&#x2014;goes to some diner near his apartment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t face it.&#x201d; Holly pulled the covers over her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t we have some sort of conversation with Dino last night? Something about Shelley Bach?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Groan again,&#x201d; Holly said, her voice muffled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t want to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a nationwide APB out for her for what&#x2014;nine, ten months? How can she elude law enforcement for that long in this day and age?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t be done,&#x201d; Holly said, still muffled.</p><p>Stone pulled down the covers far enough to expose her lips, then kissed her. &#x201c;Tell me how you&#x2019;d do that, if you were Shelley.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Holly said, &#x201c;she was an assistant director of the FBI, after all. That means she knows how law enforcement finds fleeing felons. Also, she had access to equipment and computers that would allow her to make fake IDs, driver&#x2019;s licenses, et cetera&#x2014;probably even passports. We know she switched cars early in the chase&#x2014;she probably bought a car under a false name&#x2014;and she must have had some sort of hideout ready, something out of the way and quiet. She&#x2019;s got to be calling Dino from a throwaway cell phone&#x2014;the greatest aid to criminal conduct since the blackjack. The FBI would have to be very lucky indeed to catch her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have a point,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;I have many points.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s such a striking woman that it&#x2019;s a wonder she could move around in public without being spotted by some citizen. After all, her face was all over TV last summer and fall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, but the only photo they had was the one on her FBI ID,&#x201d; Holly said, &#x201c;just a straight-on, washed-out black-and-white shot, no better than a mug shot, really, and her hair was short when that picture was taken. Hair dye and makeup can work wonders for a girl these days.&#x201d; She held up a strand of her auburn hair. &#x201c;Look at this.&#x201d;</p><p>The bell on the dumbwaiter rang, and Stone got out of bed and brought back the big breakfast tray, complete with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Stone took the front page of the Times and handed the rest to Holly.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t face the news without something in my stomach besides champagne,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Stone went to the bar fridge, came back with a half bottle of Schramsberg Blanc de Blanc, and popped the cork. &#x201c;Hair of the dog,&#x201d; he said, pouring half a glass and adding orange juice.</p><p>&#x201c;A mimosa,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Just the thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A Buck&#x2019;s Fizz, the Brits call it. I like that better.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly took a long draft. &#x201c;Whatever you call it, it hits the spot.&#x201d;</p><p>They dug into breakfast.</p><p>DINO FINISHED breakfast at his local diner then got out his cell phone and speed-dialed FBI headquarters, in Washington.</p><p>&#x201c;Deputy Director Kerry Smith,&#x201d; he said to the operator. &#x201c;Lieutenant Dino Bacchetti, NYPD, calling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Deputy Director Smith&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; a secretary said. &#x201c;Lieutenant Bacchetti?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s ... no, wait, he just got off the line.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a click, then Kerry Smith said, &#x201c;Dino?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One and the same.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A little hungover,&#x201d; Dino admitted. &#x201c;We closed Elaine&#x2019;s last night, for the last time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know, I never made it there,&#x201d; Kerry replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Too late now,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;You know who else was there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your former assistant director, Ms. Bach.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You saw her? Did you call it in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, she saw me. There was a message from her on my answering machine when I got in. You want to hear it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, please.&#x201d;</p><p>Dino held the phone next to the machine and pressed the button. When she had finished talking he put the phone back to his ear. &#x201c;Could you hear that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and I recorded it, so I don&#x2019;t have to send two agents over there to rip out your phone and take the tape.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s kind of you, Kerry. What now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll alert the New York field office, and they&#x2019;ll take it from there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want me to put out an APB with my department? Your guys don&#x2019;t know anything about finding a fugitive in New York.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t accept that contention, but I accept your offer of an APB. What do you think your chances are of finding her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About the same as yours,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;Zip, pretty much. She&#x2019;s a smart girl, you should forgive the expression, and if you haven&#x2019;t run her down so far, you&#x2019;re not likely to get her now. There are eight million stories in the city, and hers is only one of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably right,&#x201d; Kerry said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ll deny I ever said that. There&#x2019;s more bad news on that front: Shelley had substantial inheritances from her grandfather and her mother, and she moved her capital out of the country, through a series of offshore banks. She worked on capital-tracing cases earlier in her career, so she knows how to do that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So she&#x2019;s well financed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Extremely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could never get her to talk much about her background,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;What do you know about her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Born in Philadelphia, where her grandfather owned a large department store. Her father died in a riding accident when she was seven, fell off a horse and broke his neck. She and her mother moved in with the grandparents, and she had a happy life. College at Mount Holyoke and Harvard Law School, where she edited the Law Review. Joined a New York firm after school, lasted a couple of years. Hated it. Joined the Bureau for excitement, I guess, and she did well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Suppose she shows up. What do you want me to do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you nuts? Arrest her!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d feel bad about that,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;We got close when I was in D.C.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, she and I were close for a couple of years, too, but I wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate to clap irons on her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you would,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, maybe for a second or two,&#x201d; Kerry admitted. &#x201c;She was really something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;she was. See you, Kerry.&#x201d; He hung up and waved at a waitress for another cup of coffee.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>STONE GOT a call from Bill Eggers at ten.</p><p>&#x201c;Stone, we&#x2019;ve got a client who needs the sort of attention that you&#x2019;ve given our clients in the past.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s his problem?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re having lunch with him at the Four Seasons at one o&#x2019;clock. He&#x2019;ll explain it to you then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, Bill, see you there.&#x201d; Stone hung up and reflected on the kind of help he had given to clients of Woodman &amp; Weld in the past. His specialty had been to handle the kind of cases the firm did not wish to be seen handling in-house. Now that he was a partner, Stone did not particularly wish to be seen handling those cases himself. However, he could not refuse such a request from Bill Eggers out of hand. There was an etiquette involved here. Stone would have to listen to the client&#x2019;s problem, then find a way to tell Eggers that he would not handle it. He felt in a strong enough position, now, to tell him to go fuck himself, if necessary. He was responsible for three major additions to the Woodman &amp; Weld client list, one of them his late wife&#x2019;s estate, as well as himself and Peter. He made a decision: if he didn&#x2019;t want to do it, then the hell with it.</p><p>STONE ARRIVED at the Four Seasons, which occupied the ground floor of the iconic Mies van der Rohe design, the Seagram Building, which also housed Woodman &amp; Weld. He walked up the stairs, past the bar, and into the Grill Room, where Eggers&#x2019;s permanently reserved table sat. Bill was already there, and they shook hands.</p><p>Stone needed to keep his wits about him, so he ordered San Pellegrino mineral water. &#x201c;So, Bill, who&#x2019;s the client and what&#x2019;s his problem?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The client is Marshall Brennan,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;of the Brennan Group.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone didn&#x2019;t need the firm name; everybody on the planet with a room-temperature IQ knew who Marshall Brennan was and, apparently, was anxious to invest in his hedge fund, which controlled a growing...</p></p><h2>The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion: A New Abridgement from the Second and Third Editions (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>A classic study of the beliefs and institutions of mankind, and the progress through magic and religion to scientific thought, <em>The Golden Bough</em> has a unique status in modern anthropology and literature.<br><br>First published in 1890, <em>The Golden Bough </em>was eventually issued in a twelve-volume edition (1906-15) which was abridged in 1922 by the author and his wife.

Poppy's charming yellow dog starts off by eating Rocky's accordion. All of it. He snacks on a bouncing ball that belongs to Uncle Bennie's dog Buster, and then makes a meal out of the rest of the alphabet. From glue sticks to underpants, Pete works his way through all twenty-six letters in Maira Kalman's creative take on traditional alphabet books. Packed with Kalman's trademark bright artwork and a hilarious story filled with wordplay and repetition, this alphabet book is pure fun from A to Z.</p><p>You would not believe the things this dog Pete puts in his stomach. An accordion, for starters. Then an eggbeater, a glue stick, Mrs. Parsley's pink pocketbook, and cousin Rocky's underpants. ("Uggh!") Pete's faithful mistress, Poppy Wise, is at her wit's end. And yet, she can't help loving that dog. ("Quite a lot.") So, from A to Z (in a loose, meandering way), Poppy inventories her insatiable pooch's intake, with loads of parenthetical asides, witty commentary, and an unforgettable cast of characters. Maira Kalman, zany and talented source of <i>Next Stop Grand Central</i>, <i>Ooh-la-la (Max in Love)</i>, and other exquisitely quirky picture books, uses the alphabet as a framework for what is truly an ode to a well-loved if incorrigible--dog.

Share the author&#x2019;s deep connection to the natural world, his yearning for simplicity, and respect for humanity &#x2013; and see why he believes that less is more.</p></p><p><p>Larry Haun began his building career on the Nebraska prairie, where at 17 he helped to build his first house. In 1950, he began framing in Albuquerque, N.M., and in 1951, he joined his older brother in a Los Angeles building boom that brought about rapid change in tools, materials, and building methods. Later, seeing a need for passing on production-framing techniques, Haun began teaching two nights a week at a community college--and stayed there for 20 years. He retired to Coos Bay, Ore., where he built houses for Habitat for Humanity, wheelchair ramps for poor people, and backpacked in the High Sierras, the Rockies, and the Andes. He is the author of "Habitat For Humanity: How to Build a House, Homebuilding Basics: Carpentry, The Very Efficient Carpenter, " and three companion videos on how to frame a house. Larry also kept a blog, A Carpenter's View: http: //www.finehomebuilding.com/blog/a-carpenters-view, where he wrote until a couple of weeks before his death at age 80 in October, 2011.</p><p><b>Foreword</b></p><p>The first time I saw Larry Haun swing a hammer, I knew that I wasn&#x2019;t nearly as good a carpenter as I had thought.</p>It was 1987, and I had only recently walked off of a job site and into a job at <i>Fine Homebuilding</i> magazine. The Taunton Press was starting to make how-to videos, and one day the video producer invited me to watch an instructional tape from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters. The star was a tall, thin man in his 50&#x2019;s.&nbsp;Over and over, he drove sixteen penny spikes with two licks&#x2014;one to set and one to sink. The nails disappeared so fast I wondered if some magician&#x2019;s trick were secretly pulling them into the wood ahead of the hammer blows. I never saw Joe DiMaggio play baseball, but those who did describe his movements as seamless and fluid, as having no beginning and no end. One observer quipped, &#x201c;He made the rest of them look like plumbers.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s how I felt watching Larry Haun drive nails.&nbsp;Not long after I saw that video, Larry wrote his first article for <i>Fine Homebuilding</i>. He went on to write countless more, along with several books, mostly about the production framing techniques he helped pioneer on the frenzied tract developments of Southern California. His amazing skills were due, at least in part, to the fact that he kept at it long after most carpenters move on to jobs that are easier on their bodies.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s telling that when Larry finally did retire and stopped building houses for a living, he joined Habitat for Humanity and started building them for free. I would like to have been there the first time Larry Haun showed up on a Habitat project. At the peak of his powers, Larry and his two brothers could frame an entire house in a day. I imagine the Habitat foreman asking Larry if he had any experience and him replying, &#x201c;Some.&#x201d;&nbsp;On the surface of it then, this book is the story of Larry&#x2019;s life as seen through the houses he has known, lived in and built. This experience ranges from the sod houses of the great plains (his mother grew up in one), to the kit houses sold in the Sears catalog, to the little boxes of the post-World War II housing boom, to the McMansions of today. And given that we now take plywood, nail guns and the overflowing shelves at The Home Depot for granted, it is fascinating to read about a time when carpenters made their own framing hammers and soaked nails in paraffin so they&#x2019;d be easier to drive. But it would be a mistake to think of this book simply as a carpenter&#x2019;s memoir, or as a history of houses.&nbsp;As prodigious as Larry&#x2019;s carpentry skills are, and as fascinating as the span of his career has been, neither is what makes him remarkable or this book so worthy. Larry is indeed a great carpenter, but he is hardly typical. Despite a lifetime spent on raucous job sites brimming with testosterone, Larry is a quiet, unpretentious man who has long been more interested in Buddha than Budweiser.&nbsp;Larry didn&#x2019;t write this book to impress anybody. He&#x2019;s looking for deeper truths. When he reflects on the houses in his life, it is not so much to marvel at how far we&#x2019;ve come, but to see what we&#x2019;ve lost, and most important, to see what we can learn. For him it is a small step from <i>where</i> we live to <i>how</i> we live. Gently and humbly, he raises questions about the decisions we&#x2019;ve made as a society, about how we treat each other, and how we treat this planet that we live on.&nbsp;In this entire volume, otherwise filled with charming tales and timeless wisdom, only one assertion rings false. Having grown up on the high plains of western Nebraska, in an uninsulated farmhouse with no central heating, Larry says he was always cold, even in the summer. He claims that cold has dogged him to this day, which leads him to conclude &#x201c;that all my efforts, all my struggles, the reason for my existence, has been to do whatever was necessary to keep myself warm.&#x201d; Hardly. Anyone who has ever known Larry will attest, and readers of this book will soon discover, the reason for his existence has been to warm others with his remarkable spirit.&nbsp;Kevin Ireton</p><h2>Mr. Unavailable and the Fallback Girl: The Definitive Guide to Understanding Emotionally Unavailable Men and the Women that Love Them</h2><p><b>Are you the Fallback Girl?</b> <p></p> If you've ever found yourself in a relationship that feels and seemingly looks like one but you're struggling with commitment or you've been in the ambiguous territory of a 'casual relationship', you've likely tried to change them, wondered what you 'did' to cause this, what you can do to win their love and commitment, or even whether you're going crazy.

As she mixes traditional and Western literary genres, Silko examines themes of memory, alienation, power, and identity; communicates Native American notions regarding time, nature, and spirituality; and explores how stories and storytelling shape people and communities. <i>Storyteller</i> illustrates how one can frame collective cultural identity in contemporary literary forms, as well as illuminates the importance of myth, oral tradition, and ritual in Silko's own work. This edition includes a new introduction by Silko and previously unpublished photographs.</p><p></p></p><p>Leslie Marmon Silko was born in 1948 to a family whose ancestry includes Mexican, Laguna Indian, and European forebears. She has said that her writing has at its core &#x201c;the attempt to identify what it is to be a half-breed or mixed-blood person.&#x201d; As she grew up on the Laguna Pueblo Reservation, she learned the stories and culture of the Laguna people from her great-grandmother and other female relatives. After receiving her B. A. in English at the University of New Mexico, she enrolled in the University of New Mexico law school but completed only three semesters before deciding that writing and storytelling, not law, were the means by which she could best promote justice. She married John Silko in 1970. Prior to the writing of <i>Ceremony</i>, she published a series of short stories, including &#x201c;The Man to Send Rain Clouds.&#x201d; She also authored a volume of poetry, <i>Laguna Woman: Poems</i>, for which she received the Pushcart Prize for Poetry. <p>In 1973, Silko moved to Ketchikan, Alaska, where she wrote <i>Ceremony</i>. Initially conceived as a comic story abut a mother&#x2019;s attempts to keep her son, a war veteran, away from alcohol, <i>Ceremony</i> gradually transformed into an intricate meditation on mental disturbance, despair, and the power of stories and traditional culture as the keys to self-awareness and, eventually, emotional healing. Having battled depression herself while composing her novel, Silko was later to call her book &#x201c;a ceremony for staying sane.&#x201d; Silko has followed the critical success of <i>Ceremony</i> with a series of other novels, including <i>Storyteller, Almanac for the Dead</i>, and <i>Gardens in the Dunes</i>. Nevertheless, it was the singular achievement of <i>Ceremony</i> that first secured her a place among the first rank of Native American novelists. Leslie Marmon Silko now lives on a ranch near Tucson, Arizona. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>My Dearest Julia: The Wartime Letters of Ulysses S. Grant to His Wife (Library of America)</h2><p><b>The Civil War's greatest general as you've never seen him before, in a revealing collection of letters to his wife Julia introduced by Ron Chernow.</b><br><br>Ulysses S. Grant is justly celebrated as the author of one of the finest military autobiographies ever written, yet many readers of his <i>Personal Memoirs</i> are unaware that during his army years Grant wrote hundreds of intimate and revealing letters to his wife, Julia Dent Grant. Presented with an introduction by acclaimed biographer Ron Chernow, <i>My Dearest Julia</i> collects more than eighty of these letters, beginning with their engagement in 1844 and ending with the Union victory in 1865. They record Grant's first experience under fire in Mexico ("There is no great sport in having bullets flying about one in evry direction but I find they have less horror when among them than when in anticipation"), the aching homesickness that led him to resign from the peacetime army, and his rapid rise to high command during the Civil War. Often written in haste, sometimes within the sound of gunfire, his wartime letters vividly capture the immediacy and uncertainty of the conflict. Grant initially hoped for an early conclusion to the fighting, but then came to accept that the war would have no easy end. "The world has never seen so bloody or so protracted a battle as the one being fought," he wrote from Spotsylvania in 1864, "and I hope never will again."</p><p>Born in Ohio in 1822, <b>Ulysses S. Grant </b>graduated from West Point and fought in the U.S.-Mexican War before marrying Julia Dent in 1848. During the Civil War Grant proved himself to be the conflict's greatest general and became a hero to millions. His two terms as president, 1869-77, were marked by conflict and controversy, but he won renewed admiration for writing his brilliant <i>Personal Memoirs</i> while suffering from throat cancer, completing them days before his death in 1885.<br><br><b>Ron Chernow</b> is the prizewinning author of seven books--including, most recently, the national best seller <i>Grant</i>--and the recipient of the 2015 National Humanities Medal. His first book, <i>The House of Morgan</i>, won the National Book Award, <i>Washington: A Life</i> won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography, and <i>Alexander Hamilton</i>--the inspiration for the Broadway musical--won the American History Book Prize. He resides in Brooklyn, New York.</p><h2>Copenhagen</h2><p>The Tony Award&#x2014;winning play that soars at the intersection of science and art, <b>Copenhagen</b><i> </i>is an explosive re-imagining of the mysterious wartime meeting between two Nobel laureates to discuss the atomic bomb.<br><br>In 1941 the German physicist Werner Heisenberg made a clandestine trip to Copenhagen to see his Danish counterpart and friend Niels Bohr. Their work together on quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle had revolutionized atomic physics. But now the world had changed and the two men were on opposite sides in a world war. Why Heisenberg went to Copenhagen and what he wanted to say to Bohr are questions that have vexed historians ever since. In Michael Frayn&#x2019;s ambitious, fiercely intelligent, and daring new play Heisenberg and Bohr meet once again to discuss the intricacies of physics and to ponder the metaphysical&#x2014;the very essence of human motivation.</p><p>For most people, the principles of nuclear physics are not only incomprehensible but inhuman. The popular image of the men who made the bomb is of dispassionate intellects who number-crunched their way towards a weapon whose devastating power they could not even imagine. But in his Tony Award-winning play <i>Copenhagen</i>, Michael Frayn shows us that these men were passionate, philosophical, and all too human, even though one of the three historical figures in his drama, Werner Heisenberg, was the head of the Nazis' effort to develop a nuclear weapon. The play's other two characters, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr and his wife, Margrethe, are involved with Heisenberg in an after-death analysis of an actual meeting that has long puzzled historians. In 1941, the German scientist visited Bohr, his old mentor and long-time friend, in Copenhagen. After a brief discussion in the Bohrs' home, the two men went for a short walk. What they discussed on that walk, and its implications for both scientists, have long been a mystery, even though both scientists gave (conflicting) accounts in later years. <p> Frayn's cunning conceit is to use the scientific underpinnings of atomic physics, from Schr�dinger's famous cat to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, to explore how an individual's point of view renders attempts to discover the ultimate truth of any human interaction fundamentally impossible. To Margrethe, Heisenberg was always an untrustworthy student, eager to steal from her husband's knowledge. To Bohr, Heisenberg was a brilliant if irresponsible foster son, whose lack of moral compass was part of his genius. As for Heisenberg, the man who could have built the bomb but somehow failed to, his dilemma is at the heart of the play's conflict. Frayn's clever dramatic structure, which returns repeatedly to particular scenes from different points of view, allows several possible theories as to what his motives could have been. This isn't the first play to successfully merge the worlds of science and theater (one is inevitably reminded of Tom Stoppard's <i>Arcadia</i> and <i>Hapgood</i>), but it's certainly one of the most dramatically successful. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i></p>&#x201c;Endlessly fascinating....

Forget the rules (and even your ruler) as you piece colorful solids into compelling quilt designs. Use color, pattern, and repetition to develop your personal design aesthetic as you stitch freely to create unique quilts that pack a punch!</p><p>While Maria Shell&#39;s work is firmly grounded in the craft of quiltmaking, she uses her years of experience to create surprising combinations of pattern, repetition, and color. The recipient of numerous awards and fellowships, Maria lives in Anchorage, Alaska.Contemporary quiltmaker Shell specializes in prints made from combining solid fabrics into stripes, polka dots, plaids, and other common patterns. Her first book walks quilters through the various techniques used for creating these prints, many of which involve freehand fabric cutting and improv-style �assembly. Each chapter explores the creation and use of a different print type, beginning with simple ruler-made and mat-made �(freehand) stripes, and proceeding through polka dots (small, repetitive prints), triangles and other triangle-based prints such as chevrons and herringbones, and linear prints such as checks, tracks, and plaids. Samples from Shell's work are included throughout, demonstrating the vibrant designs that can be made from each of the component prints. VERDICT Shell's work echoes traditional American improvisational folk quilting and will appeal to quilters interested in exploring color and pattern via one-of-a-kind patchwork.

Now Grove Press is proud to reissue this contemporary classic by one of America&#39;s most important living writers, in a new edition of A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain that includes two subsequently published stories -- &#34;Salem&#34; and &#34;Missing&#34; -- that brilliantly complete the collection&#39;s narrative journey, returning to the jungles of Vietnam.</p><p>The Vietnam War continues to play itself out in fiction, autobiography, and history books, but no American author has captured the experiences of the Vietnamese themselves--and caught their voices--more tellingly than Robert Olen Butler, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain. The 15 stories collected here, all written in the first person, blend Vietnamese folklore, the terrible, lingering memories of war, American pop culture and family drama. Butler&#39;s literary ventriloquism, as he mines the experiences of a people with a great literary tradition of their own, is uncanny; but his talents as a writer of universal truths is what makes this a collection for the ages.ROBERT OLEN BUTLER is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of numerous novels and short story collections. He has twice won a National Magazine Award in Fiction and has received two Pushcart Prizes. He teaches creative writing at Florida State University.</p><h2>Fed &amp; Fit: A 28-Day Food &amp; Fitness Plan to Jump-Start Your Life with Over 175 Squeaky-Clean Paleo Recipes</h2><p><b>Fed &amp; Fit is all-inclusive guide to achieving true health!</b><br><br>Cassy Joy draws from her years of research and experience, to deliver a roadmap to mastering her revolutionary 'Four Pillars of True Health&#x2019;.

It seems that the association dates from very ancient times. In England it comes from the guilds of mason builders of the middle ages. Historically it may be stated that Freemasonry has existed in its present form since 1717. At that time several English lodges met in London and founded the Grand Lodges of England.

In this groundbreaking book, Pauline Brown, a former leader of the world&#x2019;s top luxury goods company and a pioneer in identifying the role of aesthetics in business, shows executives, entrepreneurs, and other professionals how to harness the power of the senses to create products, services, and experiences that stand out, resonate with their customers, and create long-term value for their businesses. The power is rooted in Aesthetic Intelligence&#x2014;or &#x201c;the other AI,&#x201d; as Brown refers to it. </p><p>Aesthetic Intelligence can be learned. Indeed, people are born with far more capacity than they use, but even those that are naturally gifted must continue to refine their skills, lest their aesthetic advantage atrophy. Through a combination of storytelling and practical advice, the author shows how aesthetic intelligence creates business value and how executives, entrepreneurs and others can boost their own AI and successfully apply it to business. Brown offers research, strategies and practical exercises focused on four essential AI skills: </p><ul><li>Attunement&#x2014;how to develop higher consciousness of your environment and the emotional effects of all its stimuli</li><li>Interpretation&#x2014;how to translate your emotional reactions (both positive and negative) to sensorial stimuli into thoughts and ideas that form the basis of an aesthetic position, preference, or expression</li><li>Articulation&#x2014;how to express the aesthetic vision for your products or services in a way that your partners and team members can implement and deliver to customers</li><li>Curation&#x2014;how to organize, integrate and edit a wide variety of aesthetic expressions and ideas into a cohesive, credible, and powerful experience for your customers.</li></ul><p><em>Aesthetic Intelligence</em> provides a crucial roadmap to help business leaders build their businesses in their own authentic and distinctive way. <em>Aesthetic Intelligence</em> is about creating delight, lifting the human spirit, and rousing the imagination through sensorial experiences.</p></p><p><p>For more than 25 years, Pauline Brown has acquired, built, and led global luxury brands.

Under Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s leadership, the country has annexed Crimea, begun a war in East Ukraine, used chemical weapons on the streets of the UK and created an army of Internet trolls to meddle in the US presidential elections. How should we understand this apparent relapse into aggressive imperialism and militarism?<br> <br> In this lively and well-informed account, the Russian sociologist and political scientist Sergei Medvedev sets out to explain the unexpected transformation of the country during Putin&#x2019;s third term in office, from 2012 to 2018. He argues that this new wave of Russian nationalism is the result of mentalities that have long been embedded within the Russian psyche. Whereas in the West, the turbulent social changes of the 1960s and a rising awareness of the legacy of colonialism have modernized attitudes, Russia has been stymied by an enduring sense of superiority over its neighbours alongside a painful nostalgia for empire. It is this infantilized and irrational worldview that Putin and others have exploited, as seen most clearly in Russia&#x2019;s recent foreign policy decisions. In the annexation of Crimea, Medvedev shows how patriotic rhetoric served to trump considerations of political or human cost.

Two, in fact: The obnoxious Frieda, of &#34;naturally curly hair&#34; fame, and her inert, seemingly boneless cat Faron. The rapidly maturing Sally, who was after all just born in the previous volume, is ready to start kindergarten and not at all happy about it. Linus&#39; life is particularly turbulent in this volume, as he is forced to wear glasses, sees the unexpected return of his favorite teacher, Miss Othmar, and coaxes Sally into the cult of the Great Pumpkin (with regrettable results). Snoopy, meanwhile, becomes a compulsive water sprinkler head stander, unhappily befriends a snowman or two, and endures a family crisis involving a little family of birds. Plus baseball blowouts (including a rare team victory), Beethoven birthdays, and plenty of dubious psychiatric help for a nickel. This book collects 730 daily and Sunday comic strips, the vast majority of which are not currently available in any in-print Peanuts collection, and many of which have never been reprinted since their initial appearance in papers over 50 years ago. New introduction by legendary jazz pianist/vocalist Diana Krall!</p><p>By 1961-62, "Peanuts" was truly the comic strip that we all <i>still</i> know and love, with situations and sayings that would cement its place as one of the most memorable literary creations of all time. Linus is firmly center stage, and if not for baseball would probably eclipse Charlie Brown in status. His efforts to defend his blanket are legendary (Lucy buries it and turns it into a kite), he gets glasses, and his favorite teacher, Miss Othmar (now known as Mrs. Hagemeyer) returns, which leads to some consternation when he (1) learns that she's accepting money to teach and (2) tells her he'll give up his blanket if she gives up biting her fingernails. There's a new character, Frieda with the naturally curly hair, and her floppy cat strikes terror throughout the neighborhood. Oh, about that baseball team. Everyone quits when Schroeder gives up baseball for Beethoven (leading CB to take out a personal ad to manage another team), they decide their pep talk is making them hypocrites, and Linus is assigned to scout the opposing team. As much as "Peanuts" is a reflection of its era ("Why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?"), it also had a self-awareness as a comic strip (Linus: "The most recent criticism is that there is too little action and far too much talking in the modern-day comic strip. What do you think about this?" CB: "Ridiculous!") that proved just how far Charles M. Schulz was ahead of his time. With fellow pianist Schroeder on the cover, Diana Krall wrote this volume's introduction. <i>--David Horiuchi</i><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p>Jazz pianist and singer <strong>Diana Krall</strong>'s albums include <em>The Look of Love, The Girl in the Other Room, From This Moment On, Quiet Nights</em> and more. She has sold more albums than any other female jazz artist during the 1990s and 2000s. and is the the only jazz singer to have eight albums that debuted at the top of the Billboard Jazz Albums. She has won multiple Grammy Awards and&nbsp; Juno Awards.</p></p><h2>Astrid Lindgren&#39;s Tomten Tales: The Tomten and The Tomten and the Fox (Swedish Edition)</h2><p>On small silent feet, the Tomten tiptoes through the snow, keeping watch over the farm on chilly winter nights.

For the millions of readers raised on <i>The Yearling,</i> here is the story of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings's experiences in the remote Florida hamlet of Cross Creek, where she lived for thirteen years. From the daily labors of managing a seventy-two-acre orange grove to bouts with runaway pigs and a succession of unruly farmhands, Rawlings describes her life at the Creek with humor and spirit. Her tireless determination to overcome the challenges of her adopted home in the Florida backcountry, her deep-rooted love of the earth, and her genius for character and description result in a most delightful and heartwarming memoir.</p><p>Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (1896-1953) is the celebrated American author of <i>The Yearling</i>, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1939.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><i>For this is an enchanted land</i><br><br>The road goes west out of the village, past open pine woods and gallberry flats. An eagle's nest is a ragged cluster of sticks in a tall tree, and one of the eagles is usually black and silver against the sky. The other perches near the nest, hunched and proud, like a griffon. There is no magic here except the eagles. Yet the four miles to the Creek are stirring, like the bleak, portentous beginning of a good tale. The road curves sharply, the vegetation thickens, and around the bend masses into dense hammock. The hammock breaks, is pushed back on either side of the road, and set down in its brooding heart is the orange grove.<br><br>Any grove or any wood is a fine thing to see. But the magic here, strangely, is not apparent from the road. It is necessary to leave the impersonal highway, to step inside the rusty gate and close it behind. By this, an act of faith is committed, through which one accepts blindly the communion cup of beauty. One is now inside the grove, out of one world and in the mysterious heart of another. Enchantment lies in different things for each of us. For me, it is in this: to step out of the bright sunlight into the shade of orange trees; to walk under the arched canopy of their jadelike leaves; to see the long aisles of lichened trunks stretch ahead in a geometric rhythm; to feel the mystery of a seclusion that yet has shafts of light striking through it. This is the essence of an ancient and secret magic. It goes back, perhaps, to the fairy tales of childhood, to Hansel and Gretel, to Babes in the Wood, to Alice in Wonderland, to all half-luminous places that pleased the imagination as a child. It may go back still farther, to racial Druid memories, to an atavistic sense of safety and delight in an open forest. And after long years of spiritual homelessness, of nostalgia, here is that mystic loveliness of childhood again. Here is home. An old thread, long tangled, comes straight again.<br><br>I think that the shabbiness of the Creek is a part of its endearing quality. I for one might admire, but never truly love, an affluent perfection. The Williamsburg restoration, for instance, is fine and proud, but it is something only to be stared at. Old Williamsburg lived in a genteel poverty that was more elegant than the new shining Governor's mansion, for its gentility came not from superimposed wealth but from long years of gracious living. The restoration is a good thing, of course, and Time will make all come right again. The Creek shabbiness was never elegant and never will be. It is merely comfortable and weather-beaten, meeting Time halfway. I am sometimes tempted to put up a new fence across the house yard. I have always thought that a white picket fence must be a great comfort to a householder. I think of the pride I should take in seeing white paint gleaming from around the bend in the road. Then Snow the grove man becomes quietly tired of waiting for me to do something, and comes driving the farm truck into the yard over the cattle-gap with a load of fresh fatwood pine posts from the hammock.<br><br>He asks, "You aim just to use the old gate, don't you?"<br><br>I aim to use the old gate, and say so, and Snow goes ahead and replaces the rotten and sagging posts with new ones. He tightens the fence wire, "Hog and cattle 4-inch mesh,"and the effect is trim and eminently suitable. I tell myself that a white picket fence would interfere with the feeling one has inside the house of being a part of the grove; that a new fence would mean tearing out the coral honey-suckle vines that cling passionately to the old wire. But the real objection is that an elegant fence would bring to the Creek a wanton orderliness that is out of place.<br><br>When I came to the Creek, and knew the old grove and farmhouse at once as home, there was some terror, such as one feels in the first recognition of a human love, for the joining of person to place, as of person to person, is a commitment to shared sorrow, even as to shared joy. The farmhouse was all dinginess. It sat snugly then as now under tall old orange trees, and had a simple grace of line, low, rambling and one-storied. But it was cracked and gray for lack of paint, there was a tin roof that would have ruined a mansion, and the porch was an excrescence, scarcely wide enough for one to pass in front of the chairs. The yard was bare sand spotted with sandspurs, with three lean Duchess rosebushes left behind to starve, like cats. Inside the house, all the delight of the Florida sunlight vanished. The walls were painted a battleship gray and the floors a muddy ochre. The brick fireplaces were walled over with tin and filled with a year's rubbish. It was four years before the gray of the last room was decently covered with white, money for paint being scarce, and time so filled with other work that an hour with the brush was a stolen pleasure. And even now, the house shining inside and out, roofed with good gray hand-hewn cypress shingles, the long wide screened veranda an invitation to step either inside or out, the yard in lush green grass, there is still a look of weather-worn shabbiness. It is a constant reminder that wind and rain and harsh sun and the encroaching jungle are ready at any moment to take over. I suppose that a millionaire, perhaps even just a New Englander, might stand off the elements and maintain a trim tidiness -- and a picket fence. But the rest of the Creek would not know what to make of it, and would be made most unhappy.<br><br>The battle has not gone too well for all at the Creek. One or two have gone ahead, some hold precariously to the narrow ledge of existence, and others have slipped back, and back, until each day's subsistence has become a triumph. Their houses reflect their fortunes. Mine lies the farthest east in the small settlement. To the west are my neighbors, my friends. There have been enmities. At the moment, we are living in unparalleled amiability, a state at Cross Creek that, like a sinner's hope of Heaven, is never assured. But it makes a good moment in which to speak of other people.<br><br>I live within screaming distance of Tom Glisson and Old Boss Brice. This is literal. No ordinary sound carries from one place to the other. We hear faintly the barking of one another's dogs. We hear the far crowing at dawn of one another's roosters. Occasionally, when the wind is right, I hear the Brice or Glisson cows lowing at milking time, night or morning. No voice carries, ever. A determined scream is audible. This I proved, not in a time of fear, but a time of fury. I should be ashamed but am not. Of folk who would have been silent under the circumstances, there comes to mind only St. Francis, and I believe that he might have cast despairing eyes to Heaven.<br><br>I can bear much physical discomfort and a great deal of actual pain, but now and then one achieves a combination of bodily annoyances that makes Job's boils seem a luxury. I shall be brief and explicit. I was entirely alone on the grove. The summer was one of the two unbearable ones, as to heat, that I have known in my years here. Summer is our unproductive period for vegetables. I had been some time without them, and was afflicted with an itching rash that I recognized too late as nutritional. The Widow Slater and I had been repairing fences together, for I gave her pasture for her milch cow in return for milking my own. We had plowed through long vines of poison ivy along the decrepit fence. Her long black flowing skirts had evidently protected her. I had worked stockingless and in brief voile. The poison ivy had erupted from hips to ankle, from fingertips to throat, overlaying the rash.<br><br>Soothing ointments and a prone position might have brought some ease. I was far from ointments and too busy to lie down. My cow broke loose from the pasture and came into the grove, tearing at the low-hanging orange boughs. I drove her out and penned her properly, and returning to the house, found myself in the middle of a patch of sandspurs waist-high. These barbed instruments of torture are all the proof one needs that there is a devil as well as a God. I was enmeshed with sandspurs, they stuck to voile skirt and to petticoat, creeping up underneath and getting a firm hold with one or two barbs, leaving the others free to grate against my skin. On normal skin they are like arrows. On a skin covered with rash and poison ivy, they were shafts of fire. I plucked at them as I went and came to the house. There the dogs were waiting for me, shut on the back porch, since they had nothing but chaos to contribute in the matter of penning a cow.<br><br>I did not think they had been there very long. Even for puppies, it did not seem too much to ask of them that they wait like gentlemen for, say, half an hour. There were four, all told. There was my own puppy. There were two of his litter mates that the travelling owner had asked me to keep for him. There was old Sport, whose huntsman master, my friend Fred, had left with me while he fished on the east coast. I can only relate that time is relative, and that what seemed like a short period to me, was evidently a long, long time in the minds of three puppies. Old Sport had become excited at their incontinence and forgotten himself, too. The porch was a shambles. Water for cleansing had to be brought from the outside pump, a bucket at a time. It took twenty buckets, as I remember, and dusk was on me when I finished.<br><br>I went then, the porch well cleaned, wet and glistening in the fading light, to water my garden. There were a few carrots that I hoped to bring through the heat, a few zinnias, half a dozen desperate collard plants, poor things but mine own. I pulled away sandspurs abstractedly as I carried out the watering pot. The mosquitoes descended on me. One would think that exposed neck, arms and face would suffice the hungriest of insects. But a mosquito is Freudian, taking delight only in the hidden places. They wavered with their indecisive flight up under my skirts and stabbed me in the poison ivy, in the nutritional rash, around the sandspurs, and settled with hums of joy in all unoccupied small spaces. It was too much. I set down the watering pot, and with no thought of help for my distress, for I was past helping, let out shriek after shriek of sheer indulgent frustration. As I say, St. Francis might have blessed the puppies and old Sport and the mosquitoes, with a kind word thrown in for the sandspurs, but I am not of the stuff of saints. I screamed. The screaming satisfied me. I finished the watering, went into the house, fed the dogs, made myself a supper, and went to the veranda to meditate. As I sat, exhausted but content, two figures strolled cautiously up the road and paused in front of my gate. It was Tom Glisson and Old Boss.<br><br>Old Boss called, "Everything all right?"<br><br>"Why, yes," I said. "Yes, indeed."<br><br>Tom said, "Seemed to us like we heard somebody call for help. We just wondered, was everything all right."<br><br>I hesitated. After all, there was nothing to be done, and at the moment, it seemed, all was too embarrassing to be told.<br><br>"I was singing," I said. "Perhaps you heard me -- singing."<br><br>"Oh," they said, and turned and walked home again.<br><br>So I say that I live within screaming distance of my nearest neighbors.<br><br>Old Boss' grove joins up with mine. We share an east-west fence line and a double row of spite trees. The spite is none of our doing, but an inheritance from earlier owners of the adjoining groves. There was a day, before the Big Freeze of '94-'95, when oranges were truly golden apples, bringing, in their rareness, incredible sums. Suitable orange land was considered worth its weight in gold. So the two unfriendly neighbors planted their orange trees, each as close to the joint fence as possible, to get all the good of the priceless soil. The result is that two lines of scrawny trees send out their roots futilely in search of sufficient nourishment. Among large trees, there are few of whom two can live as cheaply as one.<br><br>Old Boss wandered down to Florida from Georgia as a boy, nearly sixty years ago. He came down to die, he told me once, and wanted to die in the tropical sunshine. He is still a frail little man, but I think he drew sustenance from the sun and earth and the fruiting trees around him. He clerked in a country store in the village and became the owner. He yearned always for the Creek, he said. At last he took over the neglected grove on an unpaid mortgage and moved out. It means to him precisely what it means to me, and we sometimes sit together on his back porch and just look about us and say nothing. We seldom meet, but when we see each other down the road, we wave, and I know that the same warm feeling comes over the old man that comes to me. He has been father, arbiter, disciplinarian to all the Negroes who have ever lived or worked here. I challenged his authority on one occasion, but that is another story. His house is a rococo two-story affair, tall and gangling like an antique spinster. There is bamboo in the sandy yard, and hibiscus and allamanda, and a pittosporum that is so old it is not a shrub, but a great tree, covered in spring with minute flowers of a strange exotic scent. The house is on the opposite side of the road from mine, just out of sight.<br><br>Tom Glisson lives on the same side of the road as I do, and opposite Old Boss. Tom has prospered. He and his wife are Georgia folk, too, and as hard workers as I have ever known. I am not at all sure that Tom can read or write, but he talks well, with a flair for the picturesque and the dramatic. He was put to the plow when he was so small he could scarcely reach the plow handles, he told me. He was given no education.<br><br>"I made up my mind," he said, "my young uns would get a better chance than their daddy."<br><br>It has been good to see the three children grow tall and bright and handsome. The oldest boy even had a year at the University. The youngest, "J. T.," was a tragic little cripple when I first knew him. I would see him hobbling down the road on his crooked legs, with the luminous expression on his face that seems peculiar to those we call the "afflicted." Tom and his wife were not of the breed to accept an evil that could be changed, and they worked day and night to save money to send the boy away for braces and treatments. Now he too is tall and strong, and I saw him ride by yesterday on his own dwarf-mule, talking to himself and lifting his hand to an invisible audience. He was, I knew, the Lone Ranger or perhaps Buck Rogers, but he took time out courteously from his duties to call "Hey!" to me, then returned to his important and secret activities.<br><br>The Glisson house is small and brown, well kept, and the yard has been slowly given shrubs and even a bit of grass. Tom raises hogs and some cattle, has built up a little grove, and he and his wife do anything profitable they can turn their hands to. They have fought ill health as well as poverty, and it is sometimes hard to feel sympathy for what seem offhand less fortunate people, knowing what can be done with courage and hard work and thrift. Tom and I began with a strange mistrust of each other, and had some harsh encounters. I was in the wrong, and that is a story, too, and now I know him for a friend and would turn to him in any trouble.<br><br>There are no further houses until you take the sharp curve in the road that sweeps down to the Creek itself. There is a patch of thick hammock, an open field, and then, on the right, Old Joe's abandoned house. Old Joe Mackay is the last of a good farming family. The Mackay acres were well-tilled and profitable some fifty years ago. There has been no regular cultivation for years, though now and then lately some farmer from the village rents the largest cleare...</p><h2>The Laws of Murder: A Charles Lenox Mystery (Charles Lenox Mysteries, 8)</h2><p><p>It's 1876, and Charles Lenox, once London's leading private investigator, has just given up his seat in Parliament after six years, primed to return to his first love, detection.

For a quarter of an hour nobody passed down the narrow street. Such emptiness in this great capital seemed impossible, uncanny, and after a few moments of deep stillness the regular row of houses, covered so evenly by the snowfall, began to lose their shape and identity, to look as if they had nothing at all to do with mankind, but instead belonged to the outer edge of some low, lightless canyon upon a plain, in a distant and lonely and less civilized time.</p><p>Watching from the window of his unlit second-story perch across the way, Charles Lenox began to feel like an intruder upon the scene. In his experience there was a ten-minute period like this lying beyond every London midnight, though its actual time was unpredictable&#x2014;after the last day had ended, before the next day had begun.</p><p>Just as his pocket watch softly chimed for five o&#x2019;clock, however, the human stir returned to Chiltern Street. Abruptly a hunched figure in a dark coat strode past, heading south, and not long afterward the first fire of the day appeared in a low window, a small stubborn orange glow in the darkness. Soon another followed it, three houses down. Lenox wondered who the man had been, whether he was out especially late or especially early, whether his errand was one of mischief or mercy. He had been dressed respectably. A doctor, perhaps. Then again, perhaps not, for he hadn&#x2019;t been carrying the handled leather bag of that breed. A priest? A burglar? Few other professions called for a man to be awake at such an hour.</p><p>Of course, Lenox&#x2019;s was one of them. He was a private detective&#x2014;lying in wait, at this moment, for a murderer.</p><p>Across the street, the light of another fire in its hearth. Now the day was very near beginning. Lenox thought of all the maids of London&#x2014;his own included&#x2014;who woke during the brutal chill of this hour to begin their chores, to light the fires. Then he thought of his wife, Lady Jane Lenox, and their young daughter, Sophia, asleep six streets away, and with a shiver pulled his coat tighter around him. The room where he had waited all night didn&#x2019;t have a fire, since of course he didn&#x2019;t want the light of one to draw attention to his presence here. What a queer way to make a living it was, detection. He smiled. It did make him happy. Even in moments of discomfort.</p><p>Not long before, his life had been very different. It was early January of the year 1876 now; only in October had he finally, after seven years of toil, given up his seat in Parliament. During the last ten months of that period he had been a Junior Lord of the Treasury, drawing a salary of nearly two thousand pounds a year (to some men a very great fortune indeed, in a city where one could live opulently on a tenth of that sum), and it had even been dangled before him that he might, with continued industry and luck, hope one day to compete for a very high office&#x2014;indeed so high an office that one could scarcely utter its name without a feeling of awe. Even on a humbler level he might have remained useful in Parliament indefinitely, he knew. He had both an interest in and a talent for politics, and the discipline that success in that House required.</p><p>But during every hour of those seven years he had missed&#x2014;well, had missed this, the previous work of his life, his vocation, detection, and while the evenings in Parliament had been comfortable, with their beer and chops and amicable companions, they had given him nothing like the thrill of this cold, wearying night. He was where he belonged again: doing what he was most suited to do. It might puzzle the members of his caste (for Lenox was a gentleman, and nearing the age of fifty more rapidly than he would have preferred), but this disreputable line of work gave him greater pleasure than all the authorities and appanages of Parliament ever could. He did not regret going into politics, having long wished to try his hand at the game of it; still less though did he regret leaving the game behind.</p><p>The first carriage of the morning passed down Chiltern Street. Nearly every house had a fire lit below stairs now, in the servants&#x2019; quarters, and in one there was a second bright flicker of heat a story up, where Lenox could see that the head of the family had risen and was taking his early breakfast. A stockbroker, perhaps. They often had to be in the City by seven.</p><p>Another fire, and another.</p><p>Only one house remained dark. It was directly across the street from Lenox&#x2019;s window, and his gaze was focused steadily upon it. Surely the time was coming, he thought. When another carriage rolled down the street he followed its progress intently, before observing that there was a coat of arms on its door. That lost the vehicle his interest. He doubted that his quarry would arrive in such a conspicuous conveyance.</p><p>Another fire. Another carriage. The sky was growing faintly lighter, the absolute darkness of the sky lessening into a black lavender. Soon enough it would be daytime. Perhaps he had been wrong, he felt with a first hint of unease. He was out of practice, after all.</p><p>But then it came: an anonymous gig, a pair of thick-glassed oil lamps swinging from its hood, pulled steadily through the snow by a youthful gray horse.</p><p>It stopped a few houses shy of the one Lenox was observing, and a man stepped down from it, passing a few coins to its driver, who received them with a hand to the brim of his cap and then whipped the horse hard, in haste to be on his way to another fare. Or home, perhaps, who knew. Lenox&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on the person who had dismounted. Certainly it was he. Hughes: Hughes the blackmailer, Hughes the thief, above all Hughes the murderer.</p><p>He was a very small fellow, not more than an inch or two higher than five foot. He was well made, however, with a handsome face and brilliantly shining dark hair. He carried a cloth case with a hard handle.</p><p>Lenox reached up above his right shoulder and gave the taut white string there one hard, decisive pull. He let it quiver for a moment and then stilled it with his hand. His heart was in his throat as he watched the criminal, to see if the man would fly&#x2014;but Hughes continued without any hesitation toward the last dim house in Chiltern Street, the one Lenox had been watching. When he was at the door he peered at the handle for a moment, then opened his case and chose two or three items from it. He set to work on the lock. In what seemed a breathtakingly short time, not more than four or five seconds, he had the door open. It was the skill of a great criminal. He put his tools away quickly and walked inside with quiet steps, closing the door behind him. The house remained dark.</p><p>Lenox stood and smiled. He counted fifteen seconds and then walked toward the door of the room in which he had been sitting most of the night, careful to avoid moving past the windows, where his silhouette might be seen. His joints ached. His eyes felt at once tired and alive with alertness. It wouldn&#x2019;t be more than a moment now.</p><p>It was frigidly cold down on the street, and he was thankful, as he stepped into the snow on the pavement, for his rather odd-looking brown cork-soled boots, which he had ordered specially because they kept out the damp. The rest of his dress was more formal, his daytime attire: a dark suit, pale shirt, dark tie, dark hat, the only gleam of brightness on his person coming from the silver of the watch chain that extended across his slender midsection. He lit a small cigar, put a hand in his pocket, and stood to watch, his curious hazel eyes trained across the street.</p><p>&#x201c;Come along, quickly,&#x201d; he said to himself under his breath. Chiltern Street was growing busier. Two carriages passed in quick succession.</p><p>Then suddenly the brick house opposite&#x2014;the one into which Hughes had slipped so quietly&#x2014;burst from stillness into commotion. A dozen lamps blazed to life, and a dozen voices to match them. When Lenox heard an aggrieved shout, he smiled. It was done. Hughes was captured. He dropped his cigar into the snow, stamped it out with his foot, and then, looking up and down the street to make sure no more carriages were coming, stepped briskly across to witness his victory at firsthand.</p><p>Thirty minutes later Hughes was secured in the back of one of the two wagons from Scotland Yard that stood on Chiltern Street. Enough people were awake and about that a small crowd had gathered nearby, their curiosity triumphing over the cold. Lenox was outside the house with Inspector Nicholson, a tall, bony, hook-nosed young man with a winning grin, which he wore now.</p><p>&#x201c;He took the money in addition to the letters. Couldn&#x2019;t resist it, I suppose. Greedy chap.&#x201d; The dozen pound notes sitting alongside the letters in the desk had been Lenox&#x2019;s idea&#x2014;their theft would make Hughes&#x2019;s crime easier to prosecute. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need them for evidence, but you&#x2019;ll have them back in a month or two. Along with the rope and the bell.&#x201d;</p><p>Lenox looked up at the thin string toward which Nicholson gestured as he said this, hard to discern unless you were looking for it. It ran tightly overhead from one side of the street to the other; Lenox had used its bell to warn the constables waiting in the Dwyer house, the one that Hughes had entered, in case the thief was armed. Certainly he had shown time and again that he was not above violence. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no rush at all about the money,&#x201d; said Lenox, returning Nicholson&#x2019;s smile. &#x201c;Though I&#x2019;m afraid I must be off now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. The agency?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Our official opening.&#x201d;</p><p>When Lenox had left Parliament, he had agreed to a proposal from his prot�g�, Lord John Dallington, to begin a detective agency&#x2014;a venture that he had contemplated at first with reservations, but that filled him increasingly now with excitement. It would be the best in London. The founders were determined of that.</p><p>The young inspector extended a hand. He was one of the few men at the Yard who didn&#x2019;t look upon the new agency with territorial suspicion, or indeed outright disdain. &#x201c;I wish you only the very best of luck. Though we&#x2019;ll miss the help you&#x2019;ve given us over the last months, of course. Six of the seven names.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Some scores to settle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And not bad publicity, I imagine.&#x201d;</p><p>Lenox smiled. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>It was true. Lenox had devoted the months of November and December to tracking down some of the old criminals whose freedom had rankled in his bosom, when Parliament had deprived him of the time to try to take it from them. Now the press that would gather in Chancery Lane an hour hence to take photographs and write articles about the agency&#x2019;s opening would have a ready-made angle: Lenox&#x2019;s return to detection prosecuted with single-minded determination over the past months, and resulting already in a safer London. It would bring in business, they hoped.</p><p>What a day of promise! Hughes in a cell, his partners waiting for him, the brass plate upon their door&#x2014;which read LENOX, DALLINGTON, STRICKLAND, AND LEMAIRE&#x2014;ready to be uncovered. Hopefully the broken window of yesterday had been mended; hopefully the office was tidied, ready for the eyes of the press. How right it had been to leave Parliament, he saw now! A new year. The energy one drew from embarking upon a new challenge, a new adventure. He walked briskly down the street, too happy with life to worry about the cold.</p><p>Had he known how miserable he would be in three months&#x2019; time, he would have shaken his head bitterly at that misplaced enthusiasm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Copyright � 2014 by Charles Finch</p></p><h2>Hold Back the Dark (Bishop/Special Crimes Unit)</h2><p><b>A town in the thrall of evil.

She lives in North Carolina.Tuesday, October 7<br><br> Olivia Castle had experienced some monster headaches in her time, but this one, she felt sure, was about to make her head quite literally explode. It had come out of nowhere, as if something had just yanked her head into an invisible, tightening vise without warning. A vise with teeth. In pain, queasy, and shaking, she managed to lever herself up from the couch, holding one hand against the head she was sure was about to fall off, and hardly spared a moment to wonder why she'd been on the couch.<br><br> Work. She should have been at work.<br><br> Shouldn't she be at work?<br><br> Had she come home for lunch? She didn't remember.<br><br> Her head hurt too much to keep thinking about that.<br><br> She made it to the kitchen by holding on to various pieces of furniture as she passed, fighting nausea and accidentally grabbing Rex's tail when she gripped the edge of the sink.<br><br> "Waaaurr!"<br><br> "Sorry, sorry," she muttered, the headache so bad by then that her cat's cry sounded like a dozen angry crows, her own quiet voice sounded like booming thunder in her head, and even her vision was affected in some way she didn't understand; she couldn't see the pleasant Vermont view normally visible from this window. She couldn't see any real view at all.<br><br> She was seeing colors she was reasonably sure didn't exist in nature. Or anywhere else, for that matter. Moving, swirling, like colorful smoke driven by a capricious breeze, opaque and translucent by turn. And everything was so damned bright. "Shouldn't sit on the counter. How many times have I told you? Didn't see you, pal. Oh, damn, what is going on?"<br><br> There was a large economy-sized bottle of an OTC painkiller near the sink (just as there was one in almost every room of her small house, and in her purse, with a box of extra bottles in the storage closet, in case the zombie apocalypse came without warning and all the pharmacies got looted before she could get to them). Olivia closed her eyes against the unnatural brightness, fumbling the bottle open while bitterly cursing childproof caps foisted upon people who had no children, fumbled just as blindly for a glass and the faucet, and managed, finally, to swallow about eight pills, hoping she could keep them down long enough to do some good.<br><br> "Prrupp," Rex said.<br><br> "I know it's too many, you don't have to tell me that." She stood there, eyes still closed, still hanging on to the edge of the sink with one hand and her head with the other, trying to breathe normally despite the pain keeping all her muscles rigid and snatching at her ability to breathe at all, her stomach churning, the weird colors still swirling even though her eyes were closed, wishing pain meds took effect faster. Like immediately. It would have been nice, she thought, to just take a shot of morphine and become unconscious for the duration. But she'd discovered the hard way that both the law and doctors frowned on patients self-medicating, far less walking out the door of any hospital, clinic, or pharmacy with their own supply of morphine or any other industrial-strength painkiller. And besides, they said it was only migraines.<br><br> Only migraines. Only migraines. Jesus. Even though no migraine remedy known to medical science and quite a few exotic possibilities Olivia had experimented with herself had so much as touched her periodic killer headaches.<br><br> She fumbled blindly for the bottle again.<br><br> "Waauurr!"<br><br> "All right, all right. I know there hasn't been enough time. But if the pain doesn't stop soon, I'm gonna take more. Shit."<br><br> A moment later, Rex hissed.<br><br> Olivia managed to pry her eyes open no matter how much the ungodly brightness all around her hurt, and squinted at her cat in surprise. Because Rex didn't hiss, or at least never had. But as she focused on her rather odd-looking cat, his brindle-tortie coat at odds with the brilliant blue eyes of a Siamese, she realized even through the bright, swirling colors she was still seeing that Rex was scared.<br><br> Really scared.<br><br> And Rex didn't scare easily. Or . . . at all.<br><br> He was staring past her into the space behind her, the kitchen and den, and his pupils were so narrow that his eyes looked incredibly creepy, like the unnaturally blue eyes of a snake. The fur along his back was standing straight up, and his tail was about three times its natural size.<br><br> At the same time, Olivia began hearing a strange rustling sound. At first it sounded like dry leaves skittering along pavement, which was weird enough to hear inside her house with no pavement around. But then she realized it was . . . whispering. Lots of voices. Lots and lots of voices. Whispering.<br><br> It was coming from behind her.<br><br> Olivia did not want to turn around. Her mouth was dry despite the nausea, her skin was crawling unpleasantly, the pain in her head was getting impossibly worse rather than better, and she was afraid if she turned to confront an axe murderer, she'd beg him to just cut off her head and be quick about it.<br><br> Axe murderer. Idiot.<br><br> Not an axe murderer, of course. Not anyone.<br><br> Not any one . . . thing. Because she heard more than one whisper, many whispers, countless whispers. And she didn't know what they were saying, but she had the eerie feeling they were all whispering the same thing. The same words.<br><br> Still holding the edge of the sink with one hand, Olivia turned slowly to see what so frightened her cat and was making her own skin crawl in a sensation she'd never felt before.<br><br> "Oh, shit," she whispered.<br><br> The headache that was still hellishly painful didn't seem such a big deal now. Because despite all the swirling colors nearly blinding her, she could see, very clearly, why Rex was afraid. Every sharp object in her kitchen and den-every single one from every kitchen knife and fork she owned to three letter openers, two pairs of scissors, two box cutters with razor blades visible, the iron fireplace poker, and half a dozen pens and twice that many sharpened pencils-floated in midair. Different levels, some low, some as high as eye level.<br><br> With their pointy ends aimed right at her.<br><br> And they were all whispering.<br><br> "Waaurr," Rex muttered, his voice unusually quiet, questioning.<br><br> "I'm not doing it. I'd know if I were doing it, right? I always know. I have to concentrate to do it. I mean, unless I'm mad. Angry, not crazy. Though maybe crazy too. Because this has never . . . And, anyway, even if I'm mad, I don't . . . know how . . . to make anything . . . whisper."<br><br> Or how to stop it when she instinctively tried, an effort that was definitely not rewarded.<br><br> Unconsciously, both her hands lifted to her head, pressing as if to hold something in, because the headache suddenly grew horribly worse, impossibly worse, dragging a guttural groan from somewhere deep inside her, and through the bright swirl of colors that was beginning to truly blind her, she could still see all the scary-sharp weapons floating inexorably toward her.<br><br> Whispering.<br><br> What was whispering? Inanimate objects couldn't communicate, right? Not like this, at least.<br><br> The pain edged into agony, but even so she heard as if from a great distance her own shaking, pleading question.<br><br> "What? What are you saying? What do you want of me?"<br><br> And from the same great distance, she heard the whispered demand that made no sense to her.<br><br> Prosperity. Go to Prosperity.<br><br> They were still floating eerily toward her, all the pointy things that promised even more pain if they came much closer, and hard as she tried, Olivia couldn't do anything about it, couldn't stop it, couldn't see anything but them or hear anything except for that whispered demand.<br><br> Go to Prosperity.<br><br> Go to Prosperity.<br><br> Olivia heard one last thing: A moan of agony escaped her, and then everything went black.<br><br> Tuesday, October 7<br><br> Logan Alexander considered himself a man of hardheaded practicality, which to his way of thinking was ironclad proof that the universe had a twisted sense of humor. Because he was also a medium.<br><br> A medium.<br><br> And he hated being a medium. He hated being called a medium, being dragged from peaceful obscurity into an unwelcome spotlight of sorts, what he was and what he could do named if not understood, word spreading among those who scorned with suspicion and those who believed or desperately wanted to. Both always, always finding him eventually and making his life hell so that he'd have to pull up stakes again, usually in the middle of the night, and find another place to live, in another town or city or state where he could be anonymous again, just another stranger and left in peace. Until the next time he was found, and the lost ones began to seek him out again.<br><br> Not the "Can you contact my uncle George and ask him where he hid all the family money?" sort of questions that only made him impatient. Those were relatively easy to either avoid or else respond to with some bullshit answer that would satisfy the sort of people who would even ask that kind of silly question.<br><br> It was the truly lost ones that got to him, the religious who had lost their faith and needed proof of some kind of an existence after death. The parents hollow-eyed and haunted in a very human sense by the inexplicable and heartbreaking disappearance of a child. The widows and widowers bereft by the loss of the other half of themselves. And others, so many others, lost people who were desperately hopeful that he could help them.<br><br> He hated it.<br><br> But what he hated most about an ability way too many people with no understanding of what they were talking about called a gift or a curse (as if it could be anything so simple as either) was that he had absolutely no control over it. And he had been told by someone who did understand and should certainly know all about it that the "door" most mediums opened in order to communicate with the dead was, in him, always open.<br><br> Always. Or, hell, just missing entirely.<br><br> And also that mediums naturally attracted spirits. Whether they wanted to or not.<br><br> He didn't talk to the dead, certainly not willingly. They talked to him. Anywhere. Everywhere. No matter how hard he tried to ignore them. Persistent, insistent, often desperate. Dogging his steps. Showing up in different places. Making it impossible for him to go out to dinner, or to a theater and enjoy a play or movie. Impossible to attend a party, or even to date-or at least date the same woman more than once.<br><br> He'd learned that lesson the hard way, with too many first dates ending with a woman eyeing him uneasily because he'd spent too much time sending brief, fierce glares at nothing she could see past her shoulder or over her head, or at the empty chair at their table. Most were either too kind or too wary to say it aloud, but at least one date had told him frankly that she didn't see the sense in a second date since it was obvious he had more baggage than she did and she wasn't getting any younger.<br><br> And the last time an instant physical attraction had cut an evening short for energetic (if not desperate) sex in his bed, the lady had left before dawn after waking to find him sitting up in bed having a whispered but clearly angry argument with someone named Josephine.<br><br> His bedmate's name wasn't Josephine, he was wide-awake-and as far as the lady could see, nobody else was in the room. So she snatched up her clothing and ran.<br><br> Logan had not blamed her one bit. He was just grateful that she hadn't called the police to report an escaped lunatic.<br><br> At least a few before her had done something of the sort over the years, reporting him as potentially dangerous, or mentally ill, or just a man who had frightened them in an age when police were finally paying more attention to that sort of thing, leaving him to spend time in this jail or that "detention room" or in some clinic or other while the police and sometimes doctors got things sorted out to their satisfaction in the quest to determine whether he was actually a danger-to himself or others. Sometimes there were fines, sometimes an order for a psychiatric evaluation.<br><br> All because he could see and talk to the dead.<br><br> They stole any chance he had of living a normal life, these spirits, and while his sympathy was sometimes roused by a particularly sad or frightened spirit killed in some brutally unfair manner and desperate for his help, he seldom could do anything to help them, and that only added to his resentment.<br><br> At least most of them had had a shot at a normal life, before whatever unfair act or illness or accident had put them in the ground. Logan, on the other hand, could hardly get a normal day to himself. Impossible to do everyday things. Wherever he went, whatever he was doing, there was at least one dead person anxious to talk to him.<br><br> Like now. He was just blamelessly walking in the park near his current home in San Francisco, needing some morning air before he returned to the freelance IT work he did from his home office, because of course he couldn't work in a normal office setting with people all around him.<br><br> Besides, even the living had begun to wear on his nerves after a while.<br><br> Maybe especially the living.<br><br> He'd just wanted some air, that was all. And there was a dead guy walking beside him. Talking to him.<br><br> "She didn't mean to poison me, I'm sure," the older gentleman of about sixty was saying earnestly, for about the third time.<br><br> Logan paused on an arched footbridge and leaned his elbows on the wooden railing, gazing down at the happily burbling, man-made creek. A quick glance had shown him no one else was near, but he still kept his voice low; bitter experience had taught him that, as with dates, office jobs, and lovers, speaking aloud in public to people only he could see whenever normal people were within earshot too often meant a quick trip to the nearest loony bin, or at least a night in a cell.<br><br> Adding insult to injury, the cells too were always filled with dead people. Usually far more hostile than his living cellmates.<br><br> "Listen, buddy-"<br><br> "My name is Oscar."<br><br> Logan didn't bother telling him names didn't really matter. "Oscar, I don't know if your wife poisoned you-"</p><h2>The Boys of My Youth</h2><p><b>The "utterly compelling, uncommonly beautiful" collection of personal essays (<i>Newsweek</i>) that established Jo Ann Beard as one of the leading writers of her generation. </b><br><br>Cousins, mothers, sisters, dolls, dogs, best friends: these are the fixed points in Jo Ann Beard's universe, the constants that remain when the boys of her youth -- and then men who replace them -- are gone. This widely praised collection of autobiographical essays summons back, with astonishing grace and power, moments of childhood epiphany as well as the cataclysms of adult life: betrayal, divorce, death. <i><br></i><i>The Boys of My Youth</i> heralded the arrival of an immensely gifted and influential writer and its essays remain surprising, original, and affecting today. <br><b>"A luminous, funny, heartbreaking book of essays about life and its defining moments." --<i>Harper's Bazaar </i></b></p><p>Jo Ann Beard beautifully evokes her childhood in the early '60s, a time in which mothers continued to smoke right up to labor, one's own scabs were deeply interesting, and Barbie dolls seemed to get naked of their own volition, knowing that Ken would be the one to get in trouble if they were caught. Beard's memories of the next 30 years are no less sharp and wry, powered by antic melancholy, perfect juxtapositions, and "the push of love." When she was little, "the words of grown-ups rarely made sense," and even now, with the exception of her best friend and a few colleagues, not much seems to have changed. <p> In the title story, Beard and her best friend, now 38, still spend forever on the phone, an activity they perfected in junior high and that is now possible thanks to an office WATS line. Hindsight easily renders their seventh-grade ex nihilo obsession with a "ninth grader extraordinaire" foolish, along with most encounters with the boys of their youth. But their current relations with men are really no less absurd, as they realize while listening to Beard's latest possibility leave an answering-machine message: "I don't know whether to faint or kill myself. Elizabeth laughs unbecomingly. I put both hands around my own neck. We are no longer bored." </p><p> <i>The Boys of My Youth</i> is filled with family picnics, small celebrations, and fragility. Beard knows that her teenage efforts to "have a better personality" were as futile as her later attempt at "practicing being snotty, in anticipation of being dumped by my husband," but that doesn't make her any less fond of her younger self. And she has the same affection, and irritation, for her family, who slowly emerge in story after story. In "Waiting," she and her older sister try to keep calm as their mother is dying: "I hold two fingers up to remind her of how much longer she needs to keep this up, to pay attention. She holds up one finger, guess which one, to remind me of who's the oldest, who's the boss. I would love more than anything to slap her." </p><p> There isn't a weak piece in this collection, which includes the world's most perfect description of the agonies of having your hair washed--at age 3--and the ecstasies of one encounter near the Mexican border. "The car is a boiling cauldron. The coyote stands scruffy and skittish, like a wild dingo dog I met once, who bit everything in sight, wagging his tail like a maniac. Eric slides the camera to me and puts a hand on my arm. He whispers in my ear. I nod. I love dogs better than anything else on earth, next to cigarettes and a couple of people." </p><p> Beard often edges from serious laughter to high seriousness and back again. "The Fourth State of Matter" is perhaps the book's standout, a narrative about space physicists; invading squirrels; a beautiful, dying dog; a "vanished husband"; and, alas, a seminar turned 12-minute massacre. On November 1, 1991, she leaves work early and passes by the disappointed graduate student who will later that day gun down eight members of the University of Iowa physics depart. Her piece is complex and heartbreaking, a master conduit of emotion and information. As always, Beard knows the rich value of the minor ritual. Earlier, she had recalled playing "Maserati" with her collie: "I'd grab her nose like a gearshift and put her through all the gears, firstsecondthirdfourth, until we were going a hundred miles an hour through town. She thought it was funny." After "the newslady" finally confirms her colleagues' deaths, "Maserati" again figures: "We sit by the tub. She lifts her long nose to my face and I take her muzzle and we move through the gears slowly; first second third fourth, all the way through town, until what has happened has happened and we know it has happened."</p>Jo Ann Beard is also the author of the novel <i>In Zanesville</i>.

This is the true story behind the major motion picture.</b><br><br>James "Whitey" Bulger became one of the most ruthless gangsters in US history, and all because of an unholy deal he made with a childhood friend. John Connolly a rising star in the Boston FBI office, offered Bulger protection in return for helping the Feds eliminate Boston's Italian mafia. But no one offered Boston protection from Whitey Bulger, who, in a blizzard of gangland killings, took over the city's drug trade. Whitey's deal with Connolly's FBI spiraled out of control to become the biggest informant scandal in FBI history.<br><br><i>Black Mass</i> is a <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Boston Globe</i> bestseller, written by two former reporters who were on the case from the beginning. It is an epic story of violence, double-cross, and corruption at the center of which are the black hearts of two old friends whose lives unfolded in the darkness of permanent midnight.<br></p><p>In the spring of 1988, <i>Boston Globe</i> reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill set out to write the story of two infamous brothers from the insular Irish enclave of South Boston: Jim "Whitey" Bulger and his younger brother Billy. Whitey was the city's most powerful gangster and a living legend--tough, cunning, without conscience, and above all, smart. Billy, president of the state Senate, was a political heavyweight in Massachusetts. These facts alone make for an intriguing story, but as Lehr and O'Neill found out, this was only the beginning. <p> John Connolly, a rising FBI agent and fellow "Southie," had known the Bulgers since boyhood when Whitey rescued him from a playground fight. After investigating organized crime in New York, Connolly was reassigned to the bureau's Boston office in 1975, and was determined to make a name for himself by relying on his old connections. He succeeded in a big way by lining up Whitey as an FBI informant in an effort to bring down the Italian Mafia--a major coup for both the FBI and Connolly. In exchange, Bulger received protection. Though heavily involved in extortion, intimidation, assassination, and drug trafficking, Connolly's "good bad guy" did not receive so much as a traffic infraction for over 20 years. In time, however, the deal changed, and information began flowing the other direction, with Bulger manipulating Connolly and a small group of corrupt FBI agents to further his nefarious network. The criminals and the lawmen eventually became virtually indistinguishable. </p><p> <i>Black Mass</i> expertly details the twists and turns of this complex story, painting a vivid portrait of Boston's underbelly and its inclusive political machine, as well as exposing one of the worst scandals in FBI history. It's also an examination of loyalty--to family, home, and heritage--and "a cautionary tale about the abuse of power that goes unchecked." As a final favor, Connolly tipped off Bulger that he was to be indicted on racketeering charges in 1995, allowing him time to go on the lam (he's reported to have access to secret bank accounts across the country). He was added to the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted List" in 1999. <i>--Sharon M.

Manning&#x2019;s focus is not the battlefield but the caf� and kitchen, the bedroom and street, the fabric of the everyday world that has been irrevocably changed by war, yet remains unchanged.<br><br>At the heart of the trilogy are newlyweds Guy and Harriet Pringle, who arrive in Bucharest&#x2014;the so-called Paris of the East&#x2014;in the fall of 1939, just weeks after the German invasion of Poland. Guy, an Englishman teaching at the university, is as wantonly gregarious as his wife is introverted, and Harriet is shocked to discover that she must share her adored husband with a wide circle of friends and acquaintances. Other surprises follow: Romania joins the Axis, and before long German soldiers overrun the capital. The Pringles flee south to Greece, part of a group of refugees made up of White Russians, journalists, con artists, and dignitaries. In Athens, however, the couple will face a new challenge of their own, as great in its way as the still-expanding theater of war.</p><p><b>Olivia Manning</b> (1908&#x2013;1980) was born in Portsmouth, England, and spent much of her childhood in Northern Ireland. Her father, Oliver, was a penniless British sailor who rose to become a naval commander, and her mother, Olivia, had a prosperous Anglo-Irish background. Manning trained as a painter at the Portsmouth School of Art, then moved to London and turned to writing. She published her first novel under her own name in 1938 (she had published several potboilers in a local paper under the name Jacob Morrow while a teenager). The next year she married R.D. &#x201c;Reggie&#x201d; Smith, and the couple moved to Romania, where Smith was employed by the British Council. During World War II , the couple fled before the Nazi advance, first to Greece and then to Jerusalem, where they lived until the end of the war. Manning wrote several novels during the 1950s, but her first real success as a novelist was <i>The Great Fortune</i> (1960), the first of six books concerning Guy and Harriet Pringle, whose wartime experiences and troubled marriage echoed that of the diffident Manning and her gregarious husband. In the 1980s these novels were collected in two volumes, <i>The Balkan Trilogy</i> and <i>The Levant Trilogy</i>, known collectively as <i>Fortunes of Wa</i>r. In addition to her novels, Manning wrote essays and criticism, history, a screenplay, and a book about Burmese and Siamese cats. She was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1976, and died four years later.<br><br><b>Rachel Cusk</b> is the author of seven novels and two works of non-fiction.

She has a voice of her own." --Pamela Hansford Johnson, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"So glittering is the overall parade...and so entertaining the surface that the trilogy remains excitingly vivid: it amuses, it diverts and it informs'." --Frederick Raphael&nbsp;<br><br>"Neither eye nor ear nor memory has failed the author. She has reproduced, in the atmosphere of wartime Rumania, exactly that miasma compounded of bravado and fear, extravagance and hunger, pretense and anguish, chicanery and stoicism, which hung over all the little, rumor-ridden capitals before their doom."--V.

His piano keys have given life to melodies by Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, and many more. On his deathbed, moved by the wish to keep his children united, he leaves a will specifying that his descendants, if they are to get their inheritance, must live together in the family home.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over successive generations of the Alt family, history itself passes through the doors, down the halls, and into the private rooms of the Alt&#x2019;s building. There is intrigue at the court of Franz-Josef: an heir to the throne has fallen in love with Henrietta Alt, who will have to carry the guilt for his eventual suicide. There are betrayals, beloved illegitimate children, and despised legitimate offspring. There are seething passions and icy relations, a world war and the rise of Nazism to contend with. There are duals, ambitions, hopes, affairs of the heart and affairs of state. Three generations of Alts live and die at number 10 Silerstatte and each member of the family, in his or or her own way, is a privileged witness to the winds of change and a Europe at the height of both its splendor and decadence</p><p><b>Ernst Lothar</b> was born in Br�nn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno in the Czech Republic) in 1890 and died in Vienna in 1974.

So begins linguist Guy Deutscher's enthralling investigation into the genesis and evolution of language. If we started off with rudimentary utterances on the level of "man throw spear," how did we end up with sophisticated grammars, enormous vocabularies, and intricately nuanced degrees of meaning?</p><p>Drawing on recent groundbreaking discoveries in modern linguistics, Deutscher exposes the elusive forces of creation at work in human communication, giving us fresh insight into how language emerges, evolves, and decays. He traces the evolution of linguistic complexity from an early "Me Tarzan" stage to such elaborate single-word constructions as the Turkish <i>sehirlilestiremediklerimizdensiniz</i> ("you are one of those whom we couldn't turn into a town dweller"). Arguing that destruction and creation in language are intimately entwined, Deutscher shows how these processes are continuously in operation, generating new words, new structures, and new meanings.</p><p>As entertaining as it is erudite, <i>The Unfolding of Language</i> moves nimbly from ancient Babylonian to American idiom, from the central role of metaphor to the staggering triumph of design that is the Semitic verb, to tell the dramatic story and explain the genius behind a uniquely human faculty.</p></p><p><p>Born in Israel in 1969, <b>Guy Deutscher</b> studied mathematics and earned a Ph.D. in linguistics at the University of Cambridge, where he became a research fellow in 1998.

Why does language always change-and does it decline or does it progress? How did language ever become so complex? In <i>The Unfolding of Language</i>, Guy Deutscher responds to the big questions with big answers, along the way solving such mysteries as<br><br>- why German maidens are neuter but German <br>turnips are female <br>- how words manage to accomplish a complete <br>U-turn in their meaning over a relatively short <br>time-like the word "resent," which, in the <br>seventeenth century, meant "appreciate" or <br>"feel grateful for" <br>- why Islam, Muslim, and Solomon are all <br>variations on one Semitic root, s-l-m ("be at <br>peace") <br>- how the design of Sumerian (the language <br>spoken 5,000 years ago by the people who <br>kick-started history) is so sophisticated that even <br>a pause in the middle of a word can convey <br>specific information <br>- why we have feet and not foots<br>- how the French came to say "on the day of this day" <br>when they mean "today"<br>- why most of the world's languages don't have a verb for <br>"have"-and how one goes about expressing the notion <br>of possession without it <br>- why human intuition-as evidenced by all human <br>languages-discovered the connection between space <br>and time thousands of years before Einstein<br></p><h2>Pre-Algebra: California Edition</h2><p>Pre Algebra California edition.

Through the eyes of Jim Burden, her tutor and disappointed admirer, we follow �ntonia from farm to town as she survives hardships both natural and human, from poverty to a failed romance&#x2014;and not only survives, but triumphs.</p></p><p>It seems almost sacrilege to infringe upon a book as soulful and rich as Willa Cather's <i>My �ntonia</i> by offering comment. First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Belsley, Edwin Kuh and Roy E. Welsch This book provides the practicing statistician and econometrician with new tools for assessing the quality and reliability of regression estimates. Diagnostic techniques are developed that aid in the systematic location of data points that are either unusual or inordinately influential; measure the presence and intensity of collinear relations among the regression data and help to identify the variables involved in each; and pinpoint the estimated coefficients that are potentially most adversely affected. The primary emphasis of these contributions is on diagnostics, but suggestions for remedial action are given and illustrated. 1980 (0 471-05856-4) 292 pp. Applied Regression Analysis Second Edition Norman Draper and Harry Smith Featuring a significant expansion of material reflecting recent advances, here is a complete and up-to-date introduction to the fundamentals of regression analysis, focusing on understanding the latest concepts and applications of these methods.

Her novel <i>Heredity</i> appeared from Soft Skull Press in 2003.<br><p><b>From Jenny Davidson&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Other Stories</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s novella <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is at once a sharply conceived allegory about the psychological costs of living the respectable life and a thrilling page-turner as compelling as anything written by such modern masters of horror as Clive Barker and Stephen King. Published in January 1886, Stevenson&#x2019;s story quickly became a best-seller on both sides of the Atlantic. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American actor-manager Richard Mansfield purchased the copyright to Stevenson&#x2019;s novella with the goal of maintaining exclusive rights for theatrical adaptation, but the copyright laws failed to prevent a host of other impresarios from mounting competing productions; one producer touring in New England advertised that <i>his</i> Mr. Hyde was so terrifying that he had to be kept chained in a boxcar on the way to the theater. Though the text of the adaptation, by playwright Thomas Russell Sullivan, would seem dated and melodramatic to modern readers&#x2014;as does the trick photograph in which Mansfield&#x2019;s Hyde crouches behind his Jekyll, ready to spring&#x2014;the actor&#x2019;s performance brought to life for his contemporaries all the most terrifying aspects of Stevenson&#x2019;s story. First acted at the Boston Museum on May 9, 1887, as Mansfield&#x2019;s biographer Paul Wilstach recounts, <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> had immensely powerful effects on its audience: &#x201c;Strong men shuddered and women fainted and were carried out of the theatre. . . . People went away from &#x2018;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#x2019; afraid to enter their houses alone. They feared to sleep in darkened rooms. They were awakened by nightmare. Yet it had the fascination of crime and mystery, and they came again and again&#x201d; (<i>Richard</i> <i>Mansfield, the Man and the Actor</i>, pp. 146&#x2013;147; see &#x201c;For Further Reading&#x201d;). </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spectators found it difficult to believe that Mansfield transformed himself without chemical assistance, and he was charged with using acids, phosphorus, or even an inflatable rubber suit to facilitate the transformation from Jekyll to Hyde. The truth of the matter, Wilstach goes on to say, was that &#x201c;his only change was in the muscles of his face, the tones of his yielding voice, and the posture of his body&#x201d; (pp. 147&#x2013;148). The account of Mansfield&#x2019;s friend and fellow actor De Wolf Hopper confirms the effectiveness of the performance. As the two men sat one evening in a darkened room at the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia, Hopper asked Mansfield what he did and how he did it: &#x201c;&#x2018;And then and there, only four feet away, under the green light, as that booming clock struck the hour&#x2014;he did it&#x2014;changed to Hyde before my very eyes&#x2014;and I remember that I, startled to pieces, jumped up and cried that I&#x2019;d ring the bell if he didn&#x2019;t stop!&#x2019;&#x201d; (Wilstach, p. 155).</p><p>The great Victorian actor Henry Irving soon invited Mansfield to bring his production to the Lyceum Theatre in London, and <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> opened there on August 4, 1888. On the last day of August, however, an event took place that would transform the significance of Mansfield&#x2019;s production and, indeed, of Stevenson&#x2019;s story as well. The mutilated corpse of a prostitute was discovered in the East End of London, the first in a series of five or more murders attributed to the terrifying figure who would come to be known as Jack the Ripper. The Ripper cut his victims&#x2019; throats, sliced open their torsos, and removed their organs; he was suspected of having trained as either a butcher or a medical man. </p><p>As subsequent bodies were discovered, London went wild with fear. Reporters drew public attention to the extraordinary poverty and squalor of Whitechapel in the East End, where most of the murders took place, and pointed to the hypocrisy of a society that allowed such neighborhoods to exist in the face of the nation&#x2019;s great prosperity, thereby encouraging the emergence of a monster like the Ripper. Amid riots and public frenzies, many citizens wrote letters to the newspapers and the police suggesting precautions that might be taken to prevent more murders. These suggestions ranged from providing better street lighting and giving policemen whistles as a rapid warning system, to arming prostitutes with revolvers, or even dressing up police officers as prostitutes and protecting their throats and torsos with metal corsets, perhaps attached to batteries that would electrocute the unwary attacker. Many of these letters singled out prominent members of society as suspects in the Ripper murders. At the peak of the frenzy the police received more than a thousand letters a week, and the actor Richard Mansfield was among those charged with being responsible for the Whitechapel murders. As Donald Rumbelow relates in his history of the crimes, &#x201c;The writer accusing Mansfield had not been able to rest for a day and a night after seeing the performance, claiming that no man could disguise himself so well and that, since Mansfield worked himself up to such a frenzy on stage, he probably did the real life murders too&#x201d; (<i>The Complete Jack the Ripper</i>, p. 124).</p></p><h2>Marx: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>In <em>Marx: A Very Short Introdution</em>, Peter Singer identifies the central vision that unifies Marx's thought, enabling us to grasp Marx's views as a whole.

O'Keefe and R. R. Reno explain the structure and logic of the early Church fathers' interpretations of the Bible. These interpretations are considered foundational to the development of Christianity as a religion and offer insight into how the early church fathers thought about Christian doctrine and practice. By analyzing selected portions of patristic exegesis, the authors illustrate specific reading techniques employed by the church fathers to expound the meaning they believed intrinsic to biblical texts. </p><p>This approach is organized around three basic analytic strategies: literal, typological, and allegorical. The literal strategy is an intensive and broad analysis that identifies particular word associations that intensify scriptural meaning. The typological strategy interprets distinct patterns of events within scripture and applies those patterns to other events in scripture and the history of the church. The allegorical approach to biblical reading, like the topological strategy, seeks patterns in the text, but these patterns are more diverse and represent larger themes or beliefs of the early church. </p><p>Within this analytic framework, the authors explain the larger structure of patristic exegesis and argue for the importance of this structure in the emergence of Christian orthodoxy.</p></p><p><p><b>John J.

His entr�e into the literary world was eased by Gustave Flaubert, who had been a childhood playmate of his mother&#x2019;s and who took the young man under his wing, introducing him into salon society. The bulk of Maupassant&#x2019;s published works, including more than three hundred short stories and six novels, were written between 1880 and 1890, a period in which he also contributed to several Parisian daily newspapers. Among his best-known works are the novels <i>Bel-Ami</i> and <i>Pierre and Jean</i> and the fantastic tale <i>Le Horla</i>; above all, he is celebrated for his stories, which transformed and defined the genre for years.

The information is taken from the author's successful <i>Charles Dowding Vegetable Course</i> and arranged in a useful monthly journal so that no activity is overlooked and readers can follow his mantra of "little and often." In this book, <b>Charles Dowding</b> proves the efficacy of no-dig gardening and, using step by step guidance with photos, shows how to plan a vegetable garden, construct a raised bed, sow seed indoors and outdoors in spring, protect plants from the weather and pests through the season until the joy of harvesting is celebrated. The information is organized monthly from January to December, with key crops, key activities and essential reminders so nothing is missed.</p></p><p><p>CHARLES DOWDING grew up on a dairy farm in Somerset. After graduating from Cambridge he worked for a hotel in the Inner Hebrides before starting to grow organic vegetables commercially on the family farm in the early 1980s. In 1990 he left behind what was by then a large market garden to live in France and Zambia. Returning to Somerset in the mid 1990s, he established a bed and breakfast and vegetable growing business at Lower Farm in Shepton Montague, Somerset. There, Charles's salad bags were the main output from his two-acre garden of permanent raised beds and fruit trees. Charles runs vegetable-growing courses and lectures and writes books on his unique growing techniques. Since 2012 Charles has begun a new garden at Shepton Mallet in Somerset which he has designed using no-dig principles.</p><p>&#x2018; Charles&#x2019; journal is a good aide memoire, peppered with tidbits of useful information and a blank, lined page per month encourages you to use the book as a diary. We always assume it&#x2019; s our fault when we have a failure, but this might not always be the case. Keeping records is vital, especially if you are a progressive gardener, who is always trying different spacings, varieties and techniques.&#x2019; </p> <p>'A useful addition to your bookshelf'</p> <p>&#x2018; This is a sensible and very clearly presented book for those who want to tackle the art of no-dig gardening without being bamboozled by jargon. You will definitely have a clear understanding of the technique after following this guide through the year&#x2019; </p> <p>'This is such a lovely, lovely gardening book.'&nbsp; </p><br><br><p>'A useful addition to your bookshelf'</p><br><br><br><p>&#x2018;Charles&#x2019; journal is a good aide memoire, peppered with tidbits of useful information and a blank, lined page per month encourages you to use the book as a diary.

Current research lends support for a unified transdiagnostic approach to treatment of these disorders that considers these commonalities and is applicable to a range of emotional disorders. <br><br><em>Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders</em>, part of the TreatmentsThatWork series of therapist manuals and patient workbooks, is a radical departure from disorder-specific treatments of various emotional disorders, and is designed to be applicable to all anxiety and unipolar mood disorders, as well as other disorders with strong emotional components, such as many somatoform and dissociative disorders. The Unified Protocol (UP) capitalizes on the contributions made by cognitive-behavioral theorists by distilling and incorporating the common principles of CBT present in all evidenced based protocols for specific emotional disorders, as well as drawing on the field of emotion science for insights into deficits in emotion regulation. The UP contains seven modules and focuses on four core strategies: becoming mindfully aware of emotional experience; reappraising rigid emotion laden attributions; identifying and preventing behavioral and emotional avoidance; and facilatating exposure to both interoceptive and situational cues associated with emotional experiences. <em>Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders</em> will be an essential resource for all therapists and psychiatrists who implement CBT strategies, as well as any clinician treating anxiety and depressive disorders.</p><p><br><strong>David H.

A major contribution for American readers and students of Russian literature and an exciting discovery for fans of contemporary writers as eclectic as George Saunders, John Ashbery, and Martin McDonagh,&nbsp;Today I Wrote Nothing&nbsp;is an invaluable collection for readers of innovative writing everywhere.Daniil Kharms has long been heralded as one of the most iconoclastic writers of the Soviet era, but the full breadth of his achievement is only in recent years, following the opening of Kharms' archives, being recognized internationally. In this brilliant translation by Matvei Yankelevich, English-language readers now have a comprehensive collection of the prose and poetry that secured Kharms s literary reputation a reputation that grew in Russia even as the Soviet establishment worked to suppress it.</p><p>DANIIL KHARMS (1905-1942) was born in St. Petersburg and grew up amidst the Bolshevik revolution. As a young man he became well known, along with other writers in the OBERIU movement he founded, as an eccentric poet and performer of the early Soviet literary scene. He died of starvation in state custody after being arrested on suspicion of anti-Soviet activities.In this surprising new collection of Soviet writer Kharms's short pieces, including poetry and journal entries (one of which appeared in the <i>New Yorker</i> earlier this month), readers will find echoes of Beckett, Ionesco and Kafka, among others. Indeed, Kharms (1905&#x2013;1942) was part the OBERIU (Association of Real Art), a Soviet artists' collective often described as Absurdist in orientation. A self-proclaimed member of the avant-garde, Kharms made often violent nonsense out of everyday life. In 1931, he was briefly exiled because his work did not promote Socialist Realism, as Yankelovich explains in an informative introduction. Kharms's life suffered a complete reversal after his return, a fact that shows in his writing. There's a youthful showiness to the earliest work that is replaced by a more fierce desperation in the later years, when Kharms often went hungry and knew his work would not be published. The book's wonderfully contradictory title, is in unexpected contrast to the weary resignation of a journal entry: Today I wrote nothing. Doesn't matter. Yankelovich, who provides the fine translations, makes much of the dramatic possibilities inherent in the work but almost combatively refuses to read any political meaning into his subject's writings, which alternate between playfulness and a sense of futility. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The good old days were good for but the privileged few. For the farmer, the laborer, the average breadwinner, life was an unremitting hardship.

And at long last the incredible scope of her singular achievement is put on display: thirty-three stories drawn from three much-lauded collections, and another thirteen appearing here for the first time in book form. Forty-six stories in all, far and away the most comprehensive volume in her long career, showcasing her crisp, elegant prose, her dark wit, and her uncanny ability to illuminate our world through characters and situations that feel at once peculiar and foreign and disturbingly familiar.&nbsp;Virtually all American writers have their favorite Joy Williams stories, as do many readers of all ages, and each one of them is available here.</p><p><b>JOY WILLIAMS</b>&nbsp;is the author of four novels&#x2014;the most recent, <i>The Quick and the Dead,</i> was a runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize in 2001&#x2014;and three other collections of stories, as well as <i>Ill Nature,</i> a book of essays that was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

This is a book that will be reread with admiration and love many times over.&#x201d; &#x2014;Nicole Jones, <i>Vanity Fair<br></i><br>&#x201c;This volume traces Joy Williams&#x2019;s journey to sui generis master. Her nearest cousin among American writers is Don DeLillo, but only because, as with him, nobody writes sentences like she does. . . . Though she treats common states&#x2014;parenthood, pet ownership, alcoholism&#x2014;Williams eschews the realist story writer&#x2019;s bromide that in the ordinary we find the extraordinary, because there&#x2019;s nothing ordinary about her work.&#x201d; &#x2014;Christian Lorentzen, <i>New York<br></i><br>&#x201c;A fifty-course, full-tilt tasting menu of misanthropy and guile. This career-spanning collection solidifies Ms. Williams&#x2019;s position as a thorny American writer of this first rank. Dire circumstances blend with offbeat wit in Ms. Williams&#x2019;s work. The mental heat they give off places them at the far end of the Scoville scale, yet they are plump with soul and real feeling.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dwight Garner, &#x201c;The Top Books of 2015,&#x201d; <i>The New York Times<br></i><br>&#x201c;Such brilliant and depressing fiction that after I read it I was nervous to ever try writing again. . . .&nbsp; Hope is very damaged in these pages, but you will find yourself laughing out loud as you muffle a gasp of crippled optimism. I am a real Johnny-come-lately to Joy Williams, but since finishing this new collection I have run out and bought every book she ever wrote. You should, too.&#x201d; &#x2014;John Waters, <i>The San Francisco Chronicle<br></i><br>&#x201c;Joy Williams has long been one of America&#x2019;s greatest living writers, and <i>The Visiting Privilege </i>might [be] the best book of the year. Her sentences are as sharp and precise as scalpel incisions, and her ability to turn the real beautifully surreal is second to none. . . . If you have yet to read Williams&#x2019;s work, there is no better place to start than this book, which collects stories from across her decades of groundbreaking work alongside several new stories.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lincoln Michael, Editor-in-Chief, <i>Electric Literature</i><br><br>&#x201c;[This] is powerfully united by Joy Williams&#x2019;s profound gift for illuminating, with compassion and mordant humor, characters on the jagged edge of grief and spiritual ruin. . . . The search for mercy is at odds with a landscape that is increasingly merciless&#x2014;and yet hope remains [and]the stories are rich with tenderness. . . . <i>The Visiting Privilege </i>is also laced with Williams&#x2019;s trademark cutting wit, which provides a small release, as of steam escaping through a pressure valve, while also pushing the stories' dark absurdity.&#x201d; &#x2014;Laura Van Den Berg, <i>O Magazine<br></i><br>&#x201c;Immaculate artistry [and] one of the most fearless, abyss-embracing literary projects our literature has seen [with] the sort of helpless laughter that erupts when a profound moral project is conducted with such blinding literary craft. . . .

Williams has been one of the great living individualists and masters of the short story [and] lionized in America&#x2019;s innermost literary circles. . . . He work can be stark, brutal, creepy, tragic and hilarious, [and] all forty-six stories here are magnificently written.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jeff Simon, <i>The Buffalo News<br></i><br>&#x201c;Williams is brilliant in her commentary. . . . To enter <i>The Visiting Privilege&#x2014;</i>a mammoth, definitive collection of her stories&#x2014;is to smack face-first into astonishment: best words, best order. But more: One is constantly aware of a taut sensibility infusing them. Dispassionate but not <i>un</i>compassionate, this steady, Flaubertian presence, both witness and engine, demonstrates (beyond &#x2018;mere&#x2019; mastery of craft) one sublime measure of literary art. . . . Seamlessly linked, precise, forceful, they spear the reading ear, piercing to hard, weird truth.&nbsp; They propose by their very existence&#x2014;as much as by the story-freight they deliver&#x2014;that we readers follow their lead and drop all artifice.&#x201d; &#x2014;Joan Frank, <i>The San Francisco Chronicle<br></i><br>&#x201c;The year of Joy Williams. . . [She] writes some of the most memorably unclassifiable fiction out there [and] can move from precise realism to disquieting surrealism in a moment&#x2019;s notice; she&#x2019;s an incomparable figure in American literature right now.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Vol. 1 Brooklyn<br><br></i>&#x201c;Hard and bleak and somehow still bitingly funny, a kind of nihilistic long-form standup-comedy routine. &nbsp;Except you should sit down for it, and probably keep implements of self-harm out of reach.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ben Marcus, <i>The New Yorker<br></i><br>&#x201c;This is a writer who gets under your skin [with] the unadorned truth. . . . She&#x2019;s absorbed the American experience and has expressed its sorrows and defeats, as well as its tenacity, with and directness all her own. Especially when it comes to short form fiction. Many of her stories have achieved iconic status over the years. . . . Refreshingly, many of the characters in Williams&#x2019;s stories realize it&#x2019;s time to grow up, to <i>step </i>up, even those living amid disaster.&#x201d; &#x2014;Debra Gwartney, <i>The Oregonian<br></i><br><i>&#x201c;The Visiting Privilege </i>assembles stories from as long ago as 1966 and as recently as this summer....&nbsp; This is a decades-long stack of stories about people whose balance may never again tippy-toe on the ocean floor....&nbsp; When I was young I loved Joy Williams because I thought she was so hilarious.&nbsp; When I got older I loved her because she refused to look away.&#x201d; &#x2014;Choire Sicha, <i>Slate</i><br><br>&#x201c;Unbelievably funny. . . The mental heat [these stories] give off places them at the far end of the Scoville scale. <i>The Visiting Privilege </i>is a fifty-course, full-tilt tasting menu of misanthropy and guile [and] solidifies her position as a thorny American writer of the first rank. . . . This is a writer who sees deeply into the hearts of things [and her] stories transmit a deep feeling for life&#x2019;s transience.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dwight Garner,<i> <i>The New York Times<br></i><br></i>&#x201c;[This] publication is sure to be celebrated. . . . Her books have been finalists for major prizes, including the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, because she is a fiery writer with a sharp humor and a dark energy and her sentences are weird, funny, and full of emotion. . . . These stories have almost a biblical ambience [and] at times they seems to lift into the realm of tale or myth. . . .&nbsp; Williams writes about the enormous, inconvenient human capacity for love, the weighty responsibility of it, the loneliness of it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Deb Olin Unferth,<i> <i>Bookforum</i><br></i><br>&#x201c;Williams is a flawless writer, and <i>The Visiting Privilege </i>is a perfect book. . . the rare collection that doesn&#x2019;t have a single story, even a single paragraph, that&#x2019;s less than brilliant, and it proves that Williams is quite possibly America&#x2019;s best living writer of short stories. . . . Even in its darkest moments, [it] is filled with a kind of hope, even a perverse kind of joy.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael Schaub, NPR <br><br>&#x201c;Our first real opportunity to stand back from Williams&#x2019;s particular accomplishments and to see her genius whole. . . .

Encompassing writing from the 1970s to the present, this book is a savory feast. . . Dissolution and morality [are] old themes for Williams: the work that grief is, the inevitability of exiting alone, the discombobulation of once-sharp intellect, even unintended legacy. . . . Her darkness is dappled with light.&#x201d; &#x2014;Laura Collins-Hughes, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>&#x201c;She has often been anointed as the literary heir to Anton Chekhov and Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, but Williams&#x2019;s voice is most emphatically her own. Her stories begin realistically enough, then permute into hallucinatory fairy tales, as grim as anything in Grimm, but also grimly funny. Some adjective, as proprietary as &#x2018;Kafkaesque,&#x2019; is needed for stories in which murder, addiction and madness are discussed so dispassionately. The pieces are chilling, but never smug about their own seriousness. There is a deep pleasure to be had, and a kind of explosive surprise, in Williams&#x2019;s unflinching alchemy. . . . All forty-six stories are spooky and unsentimental. . . with thirteen superb new stories.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lisa Zeidner, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;To read Joy Williams is to be arrested in a state of relentless awe and wonderment. . . . [Her] preternatural intelligence, coupled with a scorching wit and an inability to bore or commit an unoriginal thought to the page, has made her a cult hero. . . Why we aren&#x2019;t worshipping Joy Williams in public squares is beyond me. With this collection we should be.&#x201d; &#x2014;Elissa Schappell, <i>Vanity Fair<br></i><br>&#x201c;An influential and long-revered body of work [by] a wizard of elegant economy, fearless wit, and sly surprise. Edgy, seductive concision is one jet to her stories&#x2019; appeal; another is her uncanny ability to illuminate hidden pockets of the human heart.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lisa Shea, <i>Elle<br></i><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;A mighty retrospective embracing four decades of daring literary excellence, precisely calibrated imagination, and uncompromising candor [by] a virtuoso with a subversive, sure-footed sense of humor and an unsparing perspective on the marauding strangeness of the human condition. . . . Jolting, tonic, and valiant in their embrace of the ludicrous and the tragic, Williams&#x2019; masterful stories belong in every fiction collection.&#x201d; &#x2014;Donna Seaman, <i>Booklist<br></i><br>&#x201c;Four dozen stories by one of the form's greatest practitioners. . . . If you want to see how the pros do it&#x2014;or simply want to read some of the best stories written today&#x2014;you need look no further.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews<br></i><br>&#x201c;The escape artists at the heart of Joy Williams' fiction, in the face of each fresh catastrophe, are like swimmers waiting to get on with the drowning, their thinking running in odd and unemployable directions and their weaknesses a terrible precinct they recklessly frequent.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even as they worry, with good reason, that their hearts will turn them in, they know we're saved not because we're worthy but because we're loved.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are fiercely dark and funny stories.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jim Shepard<br><br>&#x201c;Joy Williams stories are uncanny, unsettling and completely original.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#x2019;s hard to catch her in the act of doing what she does so well, or even to describe it: in my view, she disorients us in order to renew our sense of how genuinely strange the world is.&nbsp;She is one of the great American short story writers.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jay McInerney<br><br>&#x201c;Joy Williams has been enlightening us for a very long time about the short story but now in&nbsp;her collected stories&nbsp;we see the breadth and power of her vision.

For most Christians, the creed functions as a sort of &#x201c;ABC&#x201d; of what it means to be a Christian and to be part of a worldwide movement. Few people, however, know the source of this litany of beliefs, a topic that is further confused by the fact that there are two different versions: the Apostle&#x2019;s Creed and the Nicene Creed. <br><br>In <i>The Creed</i>, Luke Timothy Johnson, a New Testament scholar and Catholic theologian, clarifies the history of the creed, discussing its evolution from the first decades of the Christian Church to the present day. By connecting the deep theological conflicts of the early Church with the conflicts and questions facing Christians today, Johnson shows that faith is a dynamic process, not based on a static set of rules. Written in a clear, graceful style and appropriate for Christians of all denominations, <i>The Creed </i>is destined to become a classic of modern writings on spirituality.</p><p><p>Praise for <i>The Real Jesus</i><br><br>&#x201c;More than simply being a critique of the historical Jesus enterprise, Johnson&#x2019;s book provides a positive statement about what it means to have a genuine, contemporary faith in the living Jesus.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer<br></i><i><br></i>&#x201c;The best of the recent flow of books [on Jesus].&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Newsweek</i><br><br>&#x201c;One of the most exhilarating religious books published in this decade.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Christianity Today</i><br><br>&#x201c;Passionately argued . . .

Packard, an experienced biographer whose last book chronicled Victoria's final days, provides valuable insights into their complex, oft-tragic lives as scions of Europe's most influential dynasty, and daughters of their own very troubled times.</p></p><p>Incisive character studies of Queen Victoria's five daughters provide the framework for a lively survey of 19th-century European history. With three brothers securing the English throne, the princesses' royal duty was to further Britain's interests through marriage. Vivacious, intelligent Vicky (1840-1901), the spoiled eldest, had a happy union with Hohenzollern prince Frederick William, though her liberal views were unpopular in Prussia and vehemently resisted by her son Willy, who eventually became the emperor of Germany. Sensitive, altruistic Alice (1843-78); dutiful, dull Lenchen (1846-1923); and shy baby sister Beatrice (1857-1944) all married minor German royalty--though Beatrice, intended to be her domineering mother's spinster companion, didn't marry until she was 28 and continued to live in England at Victoria's beck and call. Centuries-old custom dictated that princesses must not wed subjects, but artistic, rebellious Louise (1848-1939) married a Scottish nobleman anyway and managed to lead a slightly less restricted life than her sisters, particularly as a strong supporter of charitable organizations for women. Jerrold Packard, a veteran historian-biographer with six previous books to his credit, spins an enjoyably old-fashioned narrative emphasizing personal relationships among Europe's royalty and their impact on political developments. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>The story of five women who shared one of the most extraordinary and privileged sisterhoods of all time. <p>Vicky, Alice, Helena, Louise, and Beatrice were historically unique sisters, born to a sovereign who ruled over a quarter of the earth's people and who gave her name to an era: Queen Victoria. Two of these princesses would themselves produce children of immense consequence. All five would curiously come to share many of the social restrictions and familial machinations borne by nineteenth-century women of far less-exulted class. </p><p>Victoria and Albert's precocious firstborn child, Vicky, wed a Prussian prince in a political match her high-minded father hoped would bring about a more liberal Anglo-German order. That vision met with disaster when Vicky's son Wilhelm--to be known as Kaiser Wilhelm--turned against both England and his mother, keeping her out of the public eye for the rest of her life. Gentle, quiet Alice had a happier marriage, one that produced Alexandra, later to become Tsarina of Russia, and yet another Victoria, whose union with a Battenberg prince was found to present Mountbatten clan. However, she suffered from melancholia and died at age thirty-five of what appears to have been a deliberate, grief-fueled exposure to the diphtheria germs that had carried away her youngest daughter. Middle child Helena struggled against obesity and drug addiction but was to have lasting effect as Albert's literary executor. By contrast, her glittering and at times scandalous sister Louise, the most beautiful of the five siblings, escaped the claustrophobic stodginess of the European royal courts by marrying a handsome Scottish commoner, who became governor general of Canada, and eventually settled into artistic salon life as a respected sculptor. And as the baby of the royal brood of nine, rebelling only briefly to forge a short-lived marriage, Beatrice lived under the thumb of her mother as a kind of personal secretary until the queen's death. </p><p>Principally researched at the houses and palaces of its five subjects in London, Scotland, Berlin, Darmstadt, and Ottawa--and entertainingly written by an experienced biographer whose last book concerned Victoria's final days--<i>Victoria's Daughters</i> closely examines a generation of royal women who were dominated by their mother, married off as much for political advantage as for love, and finally passed over entirely with the accession of their brother Bertie to the throne. Packard provides valuable insights into their complex, oft-tragic lives as daughters of their time.</p></p><h2>A Child&#39;s Introduction to the World: Geography, Cultures, and People--From the Grand Canyon to the Great Wall of China (A Child&#39;s Introduction Series)</h2><p><b>Readers ages 9 to 12 will travel around the globe, from Greenland to Tasmania, learning the locations and characteristics of continents, countries, and states and provinces in this lively introduction to our world, its geography, culture, and people. </b><b> </b>Starting with the basics hemispheres, latitude and longitude, continental drift, map notation, landforms, population density, and more the book gives kids a solid foundation to begin exploring world geography.

Next he deduces from it the existence and nature of God, and ends by offering a radical new account of the physical world and of human and animal nature. Written in everyday language and meant to be read by common people of the day, it swept away all previous philosophical traditions. This new translation is an ideal introduction to Descartes for the general reader. It is accompanied by a substantial introductory essay from Renaissance scholar Ian Maclean that is designed to provide in-depth historical and philosophical context. The essay draws on Descartes' correspondence to examine what brought him to write his great work, and the impact it had on his contemporaries. A detailed section of notes explain Descartes' philosophical terminology and ideas, as well as historical references and allusions. Any reader can feel comfortable diving in to this classic work of Renaissance philosophical thought.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Our sexual selves are as colorful and varied as each of our unique personalities or fingerprints. Our sexual preferences are influenced by our past experiences, our relationships, the culture in which we live, and the biochemical reactions in our bodies. No two women share the same experience of desire or even the same orgasmic pattern. Mis- perceptions about the "right" way to have an orgasm and expectations about "normal libido" leave many women feeling inadequate. With this book, I want to assist you in finding your ideal sexual self. No matter who you are and no matter what your experiences have been, your body is whole and fully capable of giving and getting great pleasure just as it is. The purpose of this book is not to fit your body into someone else's experience of pleasure, but to awaken your own natural desire and energy so that you can have a fulfilling sexual life that is truly your own.<br><br>Your preferred pattern of pleasure may be to have long hours of intense lovemaking once every 2 weeks or "quickies" twice a day. Or you may practice self-cultivation (as the Taoists refer to masturbation) that is so satisfying that partnered sex is enjoyable but not absolutely necessary. There is no "right" way to be a sexual woman. The sexual personality quiz in this chapter is meant for your perusal alone, to help you explore where you are sexually and identify the sexual self that you would like to manifest.<br><br>Taking a quiz on something as subtle and ever changing as sexuality can be difficult. As one of my students pointed out, while our sexuality may be as unique as a fingerprint, it is not nearly as permanent as one! The way in which we experience desire changes throughout our lifetimes and even throughout our weeks. Think of this quiz as simply a snapshot of you at this moment. When you're able to understand who you are in the present, it is possible to take the steps toward who you want to become on your sexual journey. Not all of the responses will fit perfectly for you, so choose the one that seems closest to your truth right now.<br><br>Please do your best not to judge yourself about your responses. It is easy to imagine that you are the only person with sexual challenges, but I assure you that this is far from the truth. I spend a good deal of my medical practice talking with my patients about their particular difficulties around sexuality. As we grow and change physically and emotionally, our sexual lives will undoubtedly offer us some challenges, no matter how sexually confident or capable we feel we are. If, for example, you rarely have sex and have never had an orgasm, this is not another opportunity to feel bad about it, but rather, a chance to be proud. You are choosing to read this book and ask for some assistance with your sexuality, something that might not have come easily for you. I hope this chapter and this book will help you to get excited about the sensual world that can unfold within your body.<br><br>Take the quiz, circling the answers that most closely approximate your experience. Add the numbers of your answers and put them in the subtotal space at the end of each section. If you wish, you can put your answers on a separate piece of paper. Refer to your subtotal as you read the two discussions that follow each of the five sections. Each discussion is targeted to those who scored within a certain range for that section. I encourage you to read both discussions, however, as many things discussed in the alternate section may apply to you as well.<br><br>If you do not wish to take the quiz, please read the discussions anyway. In them, I establish the "ground rules" for lovingly supporting yourself during your sexual exploration. And remember, this quiz is a gauge and not a grade. Approach it with a sense of curiosity and without self-judgment.<br><br>Your responses to the quiz will help you identify the roadblocks that prevent you from experiencing your full pleasure. Your answers will also help me guide you to the sections of the book that will be most helpful on your journey. It might be interesting for you to take this quiz again after you have read the book and integrated some of these practices into your life. Where are you starting from now, and where might you go? The possibilities are as endless as the vast landscape of your imagination. As the Taoists say, "The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step." So let's begin.<br><br>SEXUAL PERSONALITY QUIZ<br><br>SEXUALITY<br><br>1. How frequently do you make love with a partner or masturbate?<br><br>1. Almost never.<br><br>2. One to two times a month.<br><br>3. One to two times a week.<br><br>4. Three times a week or more.<br><br>2. Compare the frequency of your sexual experiences now (either partnered lovemaking or masturbation) to a period of your life when you felt the most sexual desire. Your sexual frequency now is:<br><br>1. Much less frequent than at the height of your desire.<br><br>2. Somewhat less frequent than at the height of your desire.<br><br>3. Almost as frequent as at the height of your desire.<br><br>4. The most frequent that it has ever been.<br><br>3. After lovemaking, what percentage of the time do you feel completely satisfied?<br><br>1. Less than 25 percent.<br><br>2. About 50 percent.<br><br>3. About 75 percent.<br><br>4. Almost 100 percent.<br><br>4. What best describes your orgasmic pattern?<br><br>1. I am never or rarely orgasmic.<br><br>2. I sometimes orgasm.<br><br>3. I usually orgasm but cannot regularly have multiple orgasms.<br><br>4. I have multiple orgasms whenever I desire them.<br><br>Add the numbers for each of your answers and put the subtotal here.<br><br>Sexuality: ______<br><br>SEXUALITY<br><br>If your subtotal is less than 10:<br><br>Congratulations. This book is a wonderful place to begin discovering or re- discovering your sexual pleasure. There is no perfect number of times that one needs to make love per week to be a fully satisfied sexual being. Our desire for lovemaking will change throughout our lives and depending on our daily experiences. It is possible, however, for everyone to have a vibrant level of sexual energy and desire, which is part of the fullness of our human expression, our passion for life itself. It is our passion that allows us to fully engage in the world, to do good work, and to enjoy ourselves. We can use the tools of Western psychology and health in combination with Taoist principles to find and expand our sexual energy. In order to nurture your passion, I suggest you explore in full the exercises and recommendations in chapter 2 on stoking the fire within. The Taoist exercises that teach you to identify and expand your sexual energy--the Microcosmic Orbit and the Orgasmic Upward Draw in chapter 6 and Ovarian Breathing in chapter 8--are enormously useful in increasing the fullness and presence of desire.<br><br>Lack of satisfaction with lovemaking, on the other hand, can often be due to difficulty with your partner (see "Partner Profile" on page 21) or not enough knowledge about what it is that you need for pleasure. In chapters 4 and 5, I'll discuss at length how to get to know your own body and its responses. If it's orgasm that is sometimes difficult, I reveal in chapter 5 specific techniques that have been proven to help women orgasm, either alone or with a partner. Then in chapter 7, I divulge the secrets to multiple orgasms.<br><br>If your subtotal is 10 or more:<br><br>Your sexual journey is unfolding, and I can help you enhance and embolden your sexual pleasure. If you have been capable of great desire but are currently lacking your full desire, chapter 2 is devoted to discovering what may be blocking the flow of your passion. I will teach you how to nurture your passion and keep it full throughout your life. If your desire is raring and ready to go, begin learning the Taoist practices that will help you refine your sexual energy for more ecstatic lovemaking. The Healing Sounds in chapter 3 prepare you for learning the Taoist sexual practices in chapter 6. If you have difficulty with orgasm, chapter 4 discusses some of the physiologic and energetic gifts of orgasm and common roadblocks that prevent women from being regularly orgasmic. If you are already orgasmic, go to chapter 5, which teaches you how to discover your own hot spots (some of which you may not yet have found) and to orgasm easily. In chapter 6, I show you, step by step, how to use your sexual energy to expand your orgasms and to feel their tingling pleasure from your nose to your toes (and a few places in between). Chapter 7 teaches the secrets to multiple orgasms, how to have pleasure that expands beyond orgasm, and, for those of you who are interested, the "how-tos" of female ejaculation.<br><br>BODILY COMFORT<br><br>5. How comfortable are you being naked with a lover?<br><br>1. I prefer to be partially dressed or have the lights out when naked.<br><br>2. I am somewhat comfortable being naked with a lover.<br><br>3. I am usually comfortable being naked with a lover.<br><br>4. I almost always enjoy sharing my body with a lover.<br><br>6. How do you relate to your body?<br><br>1. I hate my body and/or regularly consider extreme means (surgical or other) by which to make my body acceptable to me.<br><br>2. I sometimes feel good in my body but often criticize myself for how I look.<br><br>3. I usually feel good in my body but sometimes criticize myself for how I look.<br><br>4. I love being in my body and appreciate all it can feel and do.<br><br>7. How comfortable do you feel touching your genitals?<br><br>1. I touch myself only when it is absolutely necessary.<br><br>2. I am somewhat comfortable touching my genitals but have rarely touched myself for pleasure.<br><br>3. I occasionally self-pleasure or masturbate.<br><br>4. I frequently self-pleasure and enjoy touching myself alone and when with my partner.<br><br>Add the numbers for each of your answers and put the subtotal here.<br><br>Bodily Comfort: ______<br><br>BODILY COMFORT<br><br>If your subtotal is less than 8:<br><br>If you live in the United States or Europe (and increasingly, the rest of the world), the cultural ideal of what is beautiful is so far from the average female that most of us feel inadequate by comparison. It can be a tremendous challenge as a woman to feel good about and enjoy one's body. In addition, the cultural and religious traditions from which many of us come teach that the body and its pleasures are dangerous and that masturbation is sinful. In truth, your body is the most precious treasure you have, no matter what you look like. Every body is capable of giving and receiving pleasure. Taoism teaches us that the body is sacred and that sexual pleasure is a necessary part of our aliveness and our wholeness. The first step in reclaiming the enjoyment of your body is to love yourself as you are.<br><br>You will explore your body in detail in chapter 5, so that you can get to know your own pleasure spots. And although you do not have to masturbate (or self-cultivate, as the Taoists prefer to call it) in order to have a fulfilling sexual life, it certainly helps. It allows you to pleasure yourself or to teach a lover how best to pleasure you. You will practice loving regard and loving touch toward yourself in chapter 5.<br><br>If your subtotal is 8 or more:<br><br>Loving your body and being willing to share your pleasure are the cornerstones to ecstatic lovemaking. Even those of us who enjoy our bodies immensely sometimes criticize how we look or how our bodies function. How would it affect your sexual pleasure if you felt at all times that you were an incredibly beautiful, luscious woman? How would it affect your sexual pleasure if you trusted that your body knew exactly what it was doing and that you could relax and fully surrender to your pleasure during lovemaking? Our bodies are precious gifts, no matter what they look like or what challenges they may have.<br><br>In my clinic, I care for women of every age, every shape, and every color, and I can tell you that the degree to which a woman is in possession of her sexual desire and confidence has nothing to do with her body type. Many of the most desirous (and desirable, according to their partners) women that I know are overweight, so-called "flat-chested," or over 55. A recent study explored the sexual satisfaction of women who were more than 50 to 100 �ds overweight. The study showed that women were sexually satisfied, regardless of their weight, as long as their body image was positive and they had good communication with their partners, just like everyone else. Being significantly overweight did not impair their sexual enjoyment; feeling bad about their bodies or having difficulty with their partners did. Women are desirable when they experience and feel entitled to their own pleasure. Sex appeal is not all about body type; it is about how you move, how you speak, and how you express yourself when you feel desirable.<br><br>I suggest that during your reading of this book you take a break from body criticism. Do not speak critical thoughts about your body out loud, to yourself, or to anyone else. Undoubtedly, you will still have critical thoughts, but when they arise, try to express your appreciation for whatever it is that you're criticizing. For example, you might look in the mirror and think, "I have such a fat ass." Instead, try to find a way to appreciate it: "What a lovely, soft rump for my lover to sink his (or her) hands into!" When we replace negative thoughts with positive ones (even when we are stretching ourselves to be positive), new associations begin to form. So the next time that you are with your lover and he or she is gazing at your arse, you just might think, he or she "can't wait to get their hands on my gorgeous ass." Positive regard about your body feeds your desire rather than extinguishing it, because it helps you feel desirable and, therefore, rightfully entitled to feeling your sexual desire. In short, your ability to feel desirable directly influences your ability to feel desire. And a woman who feels her own desire is inherently more desirable. She shines from within with the power of her passion.</p><h2>Sound in Motion: A Performer&#39;s Guide to Greater Musical Expression</h2><p><p>David McGill has assembled an exhaustive study that uses the musical concepts of the legendary Marcel Tabuteau as a starting point from which to develop musical thought. McGill methodically explains the frequently misunderstood "Tabuteau number system" and its relationship to note grouping-the lifeblood of music. The controversial issue of baroque performance practice is also addressed. Instrumentalists and vocalists alike will find that many of the ideas presented in this book will help develop their musicianship as well as their understanding of what makes a performance "musical."</p></p><p>&#34;A most important, all encompassing book about music, its nature and its significance, not only for the professional musician, but for all those who see in it an expression of human creation. [McGill] deals with the different expressive means of sound, of styles and, perhaps most important of all for the practicing musician: the connection between attitude and aptitude. He understands perfectly that music is, after all, not a profession, but rather a way of life. . . .

Themes explored include Africa and Black internationalism, World politics, race and US Foreign Policy, representations of blackness in popular culture, and reflections on popular resistance to racial capitalism, white supremacy and more.

Yet there are those who insist that the death of six million Jews in Nazi concentration camps is nothing but a hoax perpetrated by a powerful Zionist conspiracy. <br><br>Such notions used to be the province of pseudohistorians who argued that Hitler never meant to kill the Jews, and that only a few hundred thousand died in the camps from disease; they also argued that the Allied bombings of Dresden and other cities were worse than any Nazi offense, and that the Germans were the "true victims" of World War II. For years, those who made such claims were dismissed as harmless cranks operating on the lunatic fringe. <br><br>But now, in the first full-scale history of Holocaust denial, Deborah Lipstadt shows how&#x2014;despite living witnesses and vast amounts of documentary evidence&#x2014;this irrational idea not only has continued to gain adherents but has become an international movement, with organized chapters, &#x201c;independent&#x201d; research centers, and official publications that promote a &#x201c;revisionist&#x201d; view of recent history. Lipstadt shows how Holocaust denial thrives in the current atmosphere of value relativism, and argues that this chilling attack on the factual record not only threatens Jews but undermines the very tenets of objective scholarship that support our faith in historical knowledge.</p><p><b>Deborah E. Lipstadt</b> is Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish History and Holocaust Studies at Emory University. She is the author of <i>History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving</i> (a National Jewish Book Award winner); <i>Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory;</i> and <i>Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust, 1933&#x2013;1945.</i> She lives in Atlanta.A forceful analysis of attempts to deny the Nazi Holocaust. Lipstadt (Religion/Emory University; Beyond Belief, 1985--not reviewed) traces the history of Holocaust revisionism and contends that it can no longer be ignored, showing how Holocaust-deniers, once dismissed as a lunatic fringe, have been growing in numbers and influence during the past 20 years. Citing groups like the Institute for Historical Review, publications like The Spotlight, politicians like David Duke, and academicians like Leonard Jeffries, Lipstadt presents numerous examples of attempts to prove that the extermination of six million Jews is a hoax; that only a few thousand Jews died in the camps from disease; that the Allied bombings of German cities were worse than any Nazi offense; and that the ``true victims'' of WW II were the German people. These distortions of recorded history, argues the author, threaten to undermine our Western rationalist tradition and to legitimize the politicization of history. To Lipstadt, the common thread among Holocaust deniers is a ``purely anti-Semitic diatribe'' portraying Jews as victimizers. Self-declared scholars like Arthur R. Butz (whose credentials are in electronics) claim that Jews used the world's sympathy after the war to ``displace'' another people, establish the nation of Israel, and ``steal'' billions in reparations from their German and Western ``cash cows.'' Lipstadt argues vehemently against giving revisionists a forum in the name of free speech or freedom of the press, and she details the efforts of California revisionist Bradley Smith, who pushed a ``Holocaust was a hoax'' campaign in college newspapers throughout the US. Lipstadt contends that ``the responses to Holocaust denial by both students and faculty graphically demonstrate the susceptibility of an educated and privileged segment to the kind of reasoning that creates a hospitable climate for the rewriting of history.''

Gallagher and Joan Waugh provide a fresh examination of the Civil War, its aftermath, and enduring memory in a masterful work that prize-winning historian William C. Davis calls, &#x201c;easily the best one-volume assessment of the Civil War to date.&#x201d;</p><br><p>Nothing had prepared Americans for the fury that ensued when eleven slaveholding states seceded and formed the Confederacy in 1860-1861. Four years of fighting claimed more than 1.4 million casualties, directly affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians, and freed four million enslaved black people. The durability of the Union was confirmed, and the social and economic system based on slavery lay in ruins.</p><br><p>By investigating this crucial period through the eyes of civilians, celebrated leaders, and citizen soldiers, readers interested in the Civil War era will gain a profound understanding of the dramatic events, personalities, and social and economic processes that caused the war, enabled the Union to prevail, and forever transformed the United States. It also will help readers understand why, more than 150 years after Appomattox, it remains impossible to grasp the larger sweep of U.S. history without coming to terms with the American War.</p></p><p></p><h2>Invisible Life: A Novel (Invisible Life Trilogy)</h2><p>The re-issue of a remarkable first novel by a young, gay, black author who fashioned a deeply moving and compelling coming of age story out of the highly controversial issues of bisexuality and AIDS.<br><br> Law school, girlfriends, and career choices were all part of Raymond Tyler's life, but there were other, more terrifying issues for him to confront. Being black was tough enough, but Raymond was becoming more and more conscious of&nbsp;sexual feelings that he knew weren't "right." He was completely committed to Sela, his longtime girlfriend, but his attraction to Kelvin, whom he had met during his last year in law school, had become more than just a friendship. <br><br> Fleeing to New York to escape both Sela and Kelvin, Raymond finds himself more confused than ever before. New relationships--both male and female--give him enormous pleasure but keep him from finding the inner peace and lasting love he so desperately desires. The horrible illness and death of a friend eventually force Raymond, at last, to face the truth.</p><p>E. Lynn Harris's track record as a bestselling novelist began here, with the story of Raymond Tyler, who, after years of questioning his sexual identity, finds himself torn between a married male lover and Nicole, the talented actress with whom he imagines himself able to spend the rest of his life. With a rich cast of supporting characters and emotionally wrenching plot twists, this debut proved popular enough in a self-published edition to catch the attention of Doubleday, which bought the rights to <i>Invisible Life</i> and has published each of Harris's four subsequent novels, including two sequels, <i>Just As I Am</i> and <i>Abide with Me</i>.The re-issue of a remarkable first novel by a young, gay, black author who has fashioned a deeply moving and compelling coming of age story out of the highly controversial issues of bisexuality and AIDS.</p><h2>Step Aside, Pops: A Hark!

In the morning, his pants that dance, a rose between his toes, and the sun on his legs that run. At lunchtime, an apple to bite and a moustache of white, and juice from a pear and rice in his hair. And at night, his pjs with feet and face on the seat, and sleep in his eyes and stars in the skies, as he dreams of the fun he&#x2019;ll have tomorrow.</p><p>Nancy White Carlstrom is the author of more than fifty books for children, including nine other titles in the Jesse Bear series, <i>Who Said Boo?,</i> and <i>Wild Wild Sunflower Child Anna.</i> Ms. Carlstrom lives in Fairbanks, Alaska, with her husband, David, and their two son, Jesse and Josh. And while the olive too far away for frequent visits with their family, they enjoy traveling to see their family as often as possible.<br><br>Bruce Degen has illustrated all the Jesse Bear books. He is the author and illustrator of <i>Jamberry,<i> and the illustrator of the acclaimed Magic School Bus series. He has taught courses on art and the writing and illustrating of children's books to children and adults. Mr. Degen, his wife, and their two sons, Benjamin and Alexander, live in Connecticut in a renovated farmhouse with ducks on the pond, bats in the barn, and a family tree that Jesse Bear himself would love to climb.</i></i>PreSchool-Grade 2 "Jesse Bear, what will you wear? /What will you wear in the morning?" wonders Jesse's mama. Throughout his day, Jesse proudly wears not only clothes ("my pants that dance in the morning"), but the sun, his highchair (and, inevitably, his "juice from a pear /and rice in my hair") and the bubbles in his bathtub too. The rhymes, besides having a charming lilt to them, are clean and catchy and beg to be recited. The illustrations, watercolors with pen and ink, combine freshness of color with freshness of attitude, and the result is a cheery, uncluttered exuberance. Words and illustrations interplay beautifully, each enhancing the other's brightness. The youngest members of the audience will love following the day's progression from morning to noon to night and recognizing familiar activities from each time of day; all of this is laid out simply and with great appeal. The double-page spread of Jesse's father's return home from work actually beams, seeming larger than the size of the pages. There's much for a child to recognize in this book: not just physical objects but attitudes, habits and relationships, too. Jesse Bear celebrates, and does more than justice to, youngsters' joy, pride and comfort in their own independence as they try on their own familiar environment and find that it fits.

It starts as a spritz-of-consciousness romp about kid-club entrepreneur Victor Ward, "the It boy of the moment," an actor-model up for <i>Flatliners II</i>. Ellis has perfect pitch for glam-speak, and he gives nightlife the fizz, pace, and shimmer it lacks in drab reality. Anyone could cite the right celeb names and tunes, but like a rock-polishing machine, his prose gives literary sheen to fame-chasing air-kissers. He's coldly funny: when Victor's girl tries to argue him out of a breakup, she angrily snorts six bumps of coke, stops, mutters, "Wrong vial," snorts four corrective doses from whatever she has in her other fist, then objects to a rival at the party wearing the same dress she's wearing.<p> You had to be there; Ellis makes you feel you are. But such satire is a very smart bomb targeting a very large barn. Models' status anxiety doesn't merit Ellis's Tom Wolfe-esque expertise. <i>Glamorama</i> gets better when Victor gets drafted into a mysterious group of model-terrorists who bomb 747s and the Ritz in Paris, wearing Kevlar-lined Armani suits. Oh, they still behave like shallow snobs, pronouncing "cool" as if it had 12 o's. But now when somebody swills Cristal, it's apt to be poisoned, to horrific effect, which Ellis expertly, affectlessly describes. His enfant-terrible debut, <i>Less Than Zero</i>, aped Joan Didion.

From the sudden expansion of a cloud of gas to the cooling of hot metal--everything is moved or restrained by four simple laws. Written by Peter Atkins, one of the world's leading authorities on thermodynamics, this powerful and compact introduction explains what these four laws are and how they work, using accessible language and virtually no mathematics. Guiding the reader a step at a time, Atkins begins with Zeroth (so named because the first two laws were well established before scientists realized that a third law, relating to temperature, should precede them--hence the jocular name zeroth), and proceeds through the First, Second, and Third Laws, offering a clear account of concepts such as the availability of work and the conservation of energy. Atkins ranges from the fascinating theory of entropy (revealing how its unstoppable rise constitutes the engine of the universe), through the concept of free energy, and to the brink, and then beyond the brink, of absolute zero.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Hiding the shame of their mental instability in what was once a magnificent private estate, the patients suffer from nervous attacks and tormenting dreams. But something more is going on at Portis House&#x2014;its plaster is crumbling, its plumbing makes eerie noises, and strange breaths of cold waft through the empty rooms. It&#x2019;s known that the former occupants left abruptly, but where did they go?

But even as Kitty and Jack create a secret, intimate alliance to uncover the truth, disturbing revelations suggest the presence of powerful spectral forces.

I leaned my temple against the window of the motorcar and tried to make it out in the fading light.</p><p>The driver watched me crane my neck. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, for certain,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No chance of confusion. There&#x2019;s nothing else around here.&#x201d;</p><p>I continued to stare. I could barely see cornices now, the slender flutes of Grecian columns just visible in the gloom. A wide, cool portico, and behind it ivy climbing walls of pale Georgian stone. The edges faded in the mist, as if an artist&#x2019;s thumb had blurred them.</p><p>&#x201c;A good spot, it is,&#x201d; the driver went on. My silence seemed to make him uncomfortable, had done so for miles. &#x201c;That is, for what they use it for. I wouldn&#x2019;t live here myself.&#x201d; He adjusted the cap on his salt-and-pepper head, then stroked a thorny finger through his beard. &#x201c;Table&#x2019;s low here, so it gets wet. These fogs come off the water. It all ices over terrible in winter.&#x201d;</p><p>I pulled away from the window and tilted my head back against the seat, watching through the front windscreen as the house came closer. We jolted over the long, muddy drive. &#x201c;Then why,&#x201d; I asked, &#x201c;is it a good spot?&#x201d;</p><p>He paused in surprise. I tried to remember when I&#x2019;d spoken last since I&#x2019;d hired him at the train station, and couldn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Well, for those fellows, of course,&#x201d; he said after a moment. &#x201c;The mad ones. Keeps &#x2019;em away from everyone, doesn&#x2019;t it? And the bridge from the mainland means they&#x2019;ve nowhere to go.&#x201d;</p><p>It was true. The bridge was long and narrow, exposed to the wind that had buffeted us mercilessly as we navigated its length. Any man who attempted to reach the mainland on foot would be risking his neck. I wondered whether anyone had tried and fallen to his death in the churning ocean below. I opened my mouth to ask, then shut it again.</p><p>The driver seemed not to notice. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t built as a hospital, you see. That&#x2019;s what I mean. It was built as a home, and not too long ago, either. Twenty years, give or take. Family named Gersbach, with children, too. God knows how they did it out here. Four hours on the train from Newcastle on Tyne to town, and then over that bridge. No place for a child, I say. No one saw them much, and no wonder&#x2014;it was all they could do to get supplies from the mainland, and they never could keep servants for long. I guess there&#x2019;s no explaining the rich. They left during the war. I hear they were standoffish folk. Typical for Germans.&#x201d;</p><p>We were drawing up to the house now, and he steered the motorcar around the drive, headed for the front portico. We circled a stone fountain in the center of the lawn, unused, sitting dry and stained in an empty garden bed. Patches of mist moved across it, sliding soundlessly over the sad-eyed carved Mary as she opened her blessing arms over the empty basin, blank-faced cherubs flanking her on either side.</p><p>&#x201c;You mustn&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d; The driver stopped the motor before the front steps. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s remote&#x2014;that&#x2019;s certain&#x2014;but I&#x2019;ve never heard of anyone being mistreated at the hospital. Your fellow is probably just fine. It&#x2019;ll be too late for me to come back tonight, but they&#x2019;ve nice guest rooms here, for family. I&#x2019;ll just come by tomorrow morning, then, shall I?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked at him for a moment before I realized he thought I was a visitor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>For a second his eyebrows flew upward, as if I&#x2019;d said I was checking myself in. Then they lowered in consternation. &#x201c;A nurse? I thought&#x2014;&#x201d; His gaze flicked to the rear compartment, where my valise lay. It was small enough to be an overnight bag. When he looked back at me, I met his eyes and watched him understand that the valise contained everything I owned.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said. The silence sat between us for a moment. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just get your bag for you, then.&#x201d;</p><p>He got out of the car, and I opened my door before he could come round, pulling myself from the painfully hard seat. He flapped his hands in frustration and retrieved my small bag. &#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; he said as he handed it to me, his friendly tone gone. &#x201c;These are madmen, you know. Brutes, some of them. You&#x2019;re just a tiny thing. Young, too. I had no idea you were coming to nurse, or I would have said. Most of them don&#x2019;t last. It&#x2019;s too lonely.&#x201d;</p><p>I handed him payment, the last money I owned. &#x201c;Lonely is what I want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I get called out here to pick the girls up sometimes when they leave. They&#x2019;re quiet as ghosts, and we never see the nurses in town. Maybe they&#x2019;re not allowed. I&#x2019;m not even certain they get leave.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need leave.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of nurse doesn&#x2019;t need leave?&#x201d;</p><p>Now he sounded almost annoyed. I turned away and started up the steps.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just you don&#x2019;t seem the type,&#x201d; he called after me.</p><p>I turned back. &#x201c;You needn&#x2019;t worry about me.&#x201d; I thought for a moment. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t a German name, Gersbach,&#x201d; I said to his upturned face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Swiss.&#x201d; I glanced past his shoulder to the fountain again, at Mary&#x2019;s slender, draped shoulders, her elegant arms. Then I climbed the steps toward the front doors of Portis House.</p><p>&#x201c;Katharine Weekes.&#x201d; The woman glanced through the papers in her hand, shuffling them deftly through her long fingers, the corners of her mouth turned down in concentration.</p><p>&#x201c;Kitty,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She glanced sharply up at me. We were in a makeshift office where perhaps the butler or the housekeeper had once sat, tucked in the back of the building, the room furnished with only a scabbed old desk and a mismatched wooden filing cabinet. Out the window, the fog drifted by.</p><p>She was a tall woman, with square shoulders, her hair cut in a blunt fringe that was almost mannish. She wore a thick cardigan over her uniform and a pair of half-glasses that she didn&#x2019;t bother to use dangled on a chain around her neck. The white cap she wore seemed out of place and almost ridiculous on her head. Her eyes narrowed as she looked at me. &#x201c;You will not be called Kitty,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You will be Nurse Weekes. I am the Matron here, Mrs. Hilder. You will call me Matron.&#x201d;</p><p>I filed this piece of information away. It was stupid, but I would need it. &#x201c;Yes, Matron.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes narrowed again. Even when I tried, I had never had an easy time sounding obedient, and something must have slipped through my tone. Matron would be one of those women who never missed a hint of insolence. &#x201c;It says here,&#x201d; she continued a moment later, &#x201c;that you come from Belling Wood Hospital in London, where you worked for a year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Matron.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a difficult hospital, Belling Wood. A lot of casualties came through there. A great many challenging cases.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded mutely. How did she know? How could she know?</p><p>&#x201c;We usually prefer more experienced nurses, but as you were at Belling Wood, it&#x2019;s to be assumed your skills are higher than would strictly be required here at Portis.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it will be fine,&#x201d; I murmured. I had carefully placed my hands on the lap of my thick skirt, and I kept my eyes trained on them. I wore my only pair of gloves. I hated gloves, but I hated the sight of my hands even more. At least the gloves hid the scar that traveled from the soft web between my thumb and fingers down to the base of my wrist.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you?&#x201d; Mrs. Hilder&#x2014;Matron&#x2014;asked. Something about the careful neutrality of her tone set a pulse of panic pumping in the back of my throat.</p><p>I risked a glimpse up at her. She was regarding me steadily from behind a gaze that gave nothing away. I would have to say something. I quickly searched my memory.</p><p>&#x201c;Belling Wood was exhausting,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I was hardly ever home. I began to think I couldn&#x2019;t really make a difference.&#x201d; Yes, this I remembered hearing. &#x201c;I was tired of casualty cases, and I had heard of Portis House by reputation.&#x201d;</p><p>A bit thick, perhaps, but I felt it had been called for. Matron&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t change. &#x201c;Portis has no reputation,&#x201d; she said without inflection. &#x201c;We opened only last year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear that the patients are very well treated,&#x201d; I said. Also true, even if I had heard it only from the taxi driver twenty minutes earlier.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re treated as well as they can be,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;You also have a letter of reference here from Gertrude Morris, Belling Wood&#x2019;s head nurse.&#x201d;</p><p>I watched her extract the page and read it carefully. Her eyes traveled down the handwritten paper, then up again. Sweat beaded on my forehead.</p><p>It was a lie, all of it. I&#x2019;d never set foot in Belling Wood. My London flatmate, Alison, had worked there, and in her few hours home between shifts, she&#x2019;d told exhausted stories of what it was like. It sounded like hard work, but hard work didn&#x2019;t bother me, and I wanted a job. Washing bandages and emptying a few bedpans didn&#x2019;t seem like much compared to the factory work I&#x2019;d been doing, and when I was let go, I found myself with no way to pay my half of the rent.</p><p>Ally&#x2019;d had two nursing friends over one night, and as I sat in my tiny bedroom, I listened through the thin walls to their talk. One had a pamphlet from Portis House advertising for nurses and was thinking of applying. She was sick of London and the work sounded easy&#x2014;just a few shell-shocked men, if you please, far from the blood and the vomit and the influenza in the city. But the others said the place was so far away she&#x2019;d likely go mad. Besides, rumor had it Portis House couldn&#x2019;t keep staff past a few weeks, though no one could say why, and it was desperate for girls. Who wanted to give up a good London job and go all that way to a place that couldn&#x2019;t keep nurses? Best, all the girls agreed, to stay in London and hope for a promotion&#x2014;or, even better, a husband.</p><p>I&#x2019;d sat on my thin bed listening, hugging my knees, my heart pounding in excitement as they&#x2019;d tossed the idea away, and after they left I&#x2019;d fished the pamphlet from the trash bin. It was the perfect solution. A far-distant place, desperate for girls, and all I&#x2019;d have to do was wait on a handful of soldiers. I&#x2019;d sent off an application claiming Ally&#x2019;s experience as mine, complete with a letter of reference from the head nurse. Ally had talked about her often enough; it was simple to change my handwriting and use the woman&#x2019;s name. Who would check too closely in these days of chaos, with the war just over?</p><p>I&#x2019;d received a reply within a few days&#x2014;an acceptance sight unseen, accompanied by travel instructions. I&#x2019;d told Ally a made-up story about getting another factory job and packed my bag, leaving her none the wiser. If it doesn&#x2019;t harm anyone, I&#x2019;d always thought, it&#x2019;s fair game.</p><p>Matron folded the paper again and put it on the desk. The pulse of fear in my throat slowed.</p><p>&#x201c;This all seems in order,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>I swallowed and nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Conditions here can be challenging,&#x201d; she went on, &#x201c;and our location is isolated. It isn&#x2019;t easy work. We have a hard time getting girls to stay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You likely will.&#x201d; She tilted her head and regarded me. &#x201c;Because Gertrude Morris happens to be my second cousin, and that isn&#x2019;t her handwriting at all.&#x201d;</p><p>My heart dropped to my stomach. No. No. &#x201c;I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be quiet.&#x201d; Her voice was kept even, and her eyelids drooped over her eyes for a brief moment in what almost seemed an expression of triumph. &#x201c;I should not only turn you away, I should report you to Mr. Deighton, the owner. A word from him to your next employer and you&#x2019;d be out on the streets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you brought me all the way here.&#x201d; I tried to speak calmly, not to sound shrill, but it came out a croak. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t just turn me away. Why did you bring me here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t. Mr. Deighton did. I was away for several days, and your application fell to him. Believe me, if he&#x2019;d waited to seek my counsel, none of this would be happening.&#x201d; She sounded a little disgusted, as if the slight was a frequent one. &#x201c;But now it&#x2019;s done.&#x201d;</p><p>What did that mean? I waited.</p><p>Matron leaned back in her chair and examined me. &#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you had measles?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chicken pox?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have varicose veins?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Susceptible to infection?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been sick a day in my life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you capable of holding down a man who is thrashing and calling you names?&#x201d;</p><p>Steady. She was trying to throw me, but I wouldn&#x2019;t let her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about the thrashing, but I&#x2019;ve been called every name in the book and then some.&#x201d;</p><p>She sighed. &#x201c;You seem awfully confident. You shouldn&#x2019;t be. You&#x2019;re a pert one, too, and don&#x2019;t think I can&#x2019;t tell. I don&#x2019;t care for your attitude.&#x201d; She glanced down at the papers before her again, then back at me, and now her jaw was set. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re up to, Miss Weekes, and I don&#x2019;t care to know. As it happens, I&#x2019;m in dire need of a nurse. I haven&#x2019;t been able to keep a girl past three weeks, and it&#x2019;s put the work far behind. Frankly, I&#x2019;m about to lose my position over it.&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked. I hadn&#x2019;t expected candor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay,&#x201d; I said again.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll thank you to remember that, and not come crying to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t come crying to anyone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You say that now. Another thing&#x2014;I keep rules here at Portis House. Show respect to myself, to the doctors, and to Mr. Deighton when he comes for inspection. Cleanliness and neatness at all times. Always wear your uniform. Shifts are of sixteen hours&#x2019; duration, with two hours of leisure time in the early afternoon, and one week&#x2019;s night shift per month. You get a half day off every four weeks only, and no other leave will be given. Curfew is strictly enforced, and no fraternizing with the men. Breaking the rules is grounds for immediate dismissal. Do I make myself clear? And for the last time, you&#x2019;re to call me Matron.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t believe that this was happening, that I would be staying. That my wild plan had worked. This place is perfect&#x2014;so perfect. I&#x2019;ll never be found. &#x201c;Yes, Matron.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will not discuss your background, or lack of it, with anyone for now. But you are expected to perform all the duties of a nurse, to the level of your fellow nurses. How you do that is your problem. Is this fully understood?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Matron.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, then. I&#x2019;ll have Nurse Fellows show you around the place.&#x201d; She stood.</p><p>I stood as well, but I didn&#x2019;t follow her to the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; she said irritably when she opened the door and turned back to see me standing there. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Why did you accept me, really? You don&#x2019;t like me at all. Why didn&#x2019;t you turn me away?&#x201d;</p><p>I could see her deciding whether to answer, but her distaste for me won out and she went ahead. &#x201c;Very well. Because I think the only girls who will stay here will be the ones who have nowhere else to go,&#x201d; she said bluntly. &#x201c;Normal girls haven&#x2019;t worked, but someone desperate might do.&#x201d; She shrugged. &#x201c;And now I&#x2019;ve found you.&#x201d; She turned to the open doorway. &#x201c;Nurse Fellows, please show Nurse Weekes to her quarters.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Fully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto</h2><p><b>A different kind of politics for a new kind of society--beyond work, scarcity and capitalism</b><br><br>In the twenty-first century, new technologies should liberate us from work. Automation, rather than undermining an economy built on full employment, is instead the path to a world of liberty, luxury and happiness&#x2014;for everyone. Technological advance will reduce the value of commodities&#x2014;food, healthcare and housing&#x2014;towards zero.<br><br> Improvements in renewable energies will make fossil fuels a thing of the past. Asteroids will be mined for essential minerals. Genetic editing and synthetic biology will prolong life, virtually eliminate disease and provide meat without animals. New horizons beckon.<br><br> In <i>Fully Automated Luxury Communism</i>, Aaron Bastani conjures a vision of extraordinary hope, showing how we move to energy abundance, feed a world of 9 billion, overcome work, transcend the limits of biology, and establish meaningful freedom for everyone.

The texts represent women of all social classes, from public figures remembered for their deeds (or misdeeds), to priestesses, poets, and intellectuals, to working women, such as musicians, wet nurses, and prostitutes, to homemakers. The editors have selected texts from hard-to-find sources, such as inscriptions, papyri, and medical treatises, many of which have not previously been translated into English. The resulting compilation is both an invaluable aid to research and a clear guide through this complex subject.</p><p>Building on the third edition&#x2019;s appendix of updates, the fourth adds many new and unusual texts and images, as well as such student-friendly features as a map and chapter overviews.

Unfortunately, these fields tend to function in isolation from each other. The result is a substantial disconnect between grief research, theory, and care�which has evolved greatly over the last two decades�and ministerial practice.<p></p><br>Using a metaphor of grief as a mosaic, Melissa Kelley presents contemporary grief theory and research, integrated with important theological, religious, and ministerial perspectives. Written in an accessible way for ministers, ministers-in-training, and all pastoral and spiritual caregivers, this book provides the most up-to-date theory and research in grief to help inform their care of others. Through exploration of critical topics including attachment to God, meaning making, and religious coping in grief, readers are brought right to the heart of a contemporary understanding of grief.</p><p>Melissa M. Kelley is Assistant Professor of Pastoral Care and Counseling, Boston College School of Theology and Ministry. She is among an elite number of professionals certified by the American Association of Pastoral Counselors (AAPC) and the Association for Death Education and Counseling (ADEC)."This book represents the cutting edge of grief theory and pastoral practice concerning bereavement. The author has integrated the finest research on grief and ministry to the grieving with a constructivist perspective showing the uniqueness of each person's grief. Paradoxically this book on sadness is a joy to read with its superb case studies explicating various facets of grief work and pastoral care." --Merle Jordan, Professor of Pastoral Psychology Emeritus, Boston University<br><br>"Well researched and thoughtfully written, Melissa Kelley not only amends outdated ideas about grief with the latest social science on attachment, meaning-making, and coping. She adds what most secular theory overlooks - a wise grasp of religion, theology, and pastoral ministry. This book is a critical resource for professional caregivers and for all those who have lost loved ones and desire healing." --Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore, E. Rhodes and Leona B.

Between 1900 and 1907, she infected twenty-two New Yorkers with typhoid fever through her puddings and cakes; one of them died. Tracked down through epidemiological detective work, she was finally apprehended as she hid behind a barricade of trashcans. To protect the public's health, authorities isolated her on Manhattan's North Brother Island, where she died some thirty years later.<br><br>This book tells the remarkable story of Mary Mallon--the real Typhoid Mary. Combining social history with biography, historian Judith Leavitt re-creates early-twentieth-century New York City, a world of strict class divisions and prejudice against immigrants and women. Leavitt engages the reader with the excitement of the early days of microbiology and brings to life the conflicting perspectives of journalists, public health officials, the law, and Mary Mallon herself.<br><br>Leavitt's readable account illuminates dilemmas that continue to haunt us. To what degree are we willing to sacrifice individual liberty to protect the public's health? How far should we go in the age of AIDS, drug-resistant tuberculosis, and other diseases? For anyone who is concerned about the threats and quandaries posed by new epidemics, <i>Typhoid Mary</i> is a vivid reminder of the human side of disease and disease control.</p><p><b>Judith Walzer Leavitt </b>is a professor at University of Wisconsin&#x2014;Madison specializing in medical history and women&#x2019;s studies. Her published works include <i>Typhoid Mary: Captive to the Public&#x2019;s Health</i>;&nbsp;<i>Make Room for Daddy: The Journey from Waiting Room to Birthing Room;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Brought to Bed: Childbearing in America, 1750-1950</i>. Leavitt studied at Antioch College and University of Chicago.A social historian's thoughtful examination of the conflict between individual liberty and public health as exemplified by the case of Mary Mallon, the typhoid fever carrier who, early in this century, was permanently isolated by New York authorities on an island in the East River. Typhoid Mary, an Irish immigrant cook who unwittingly brought death and disease to those who ate her fare, was in 1907 the first person to be identified as a healthy typhoid carrier; she was also the only one to be imprisoned for life as a menace to public health. Leavitt, who teaches women's studies and the history of medicine at the University of Wisconsin, expertly retells Typhoid Mary's story from several perspectives--those of the then-new science of bacteriology, public health policy, the law, the social prejudices of the period, the media, and Mary herself. Leavitt demonstrates how each of these interpretations reinforces or conflicts with the others, leaving the reader to puzzle out the truths of the differing narratives. Interest in Typhoid Mary did not end with her death in 1938, and Leavitt shows how she has been depicted since then in theatrical presentations, novels, and magazine articles. Indeed, the main question her story raises is especially pertinent in today's era of AIDs and drug-resistant tuberculosis: How is it possible to protect the public health from carriers of diseases without infringing on individuals' civil liberties? Leavitt's response is that programs that stigmatize or impoverish people, or that employ coercive mass isolation, are undemocratic and ultimately ineffective. By bringing to light the story of an individual both stigmatized and isolated, she makes a vivid and worthy contribution to the search for humane and equitable answers.

Magic and mischief is in the air but if villainous Captain Hook has his way, before long someone will be swimming with the crocodiles . . .</p><p>"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

A MURDER FOR HER MAJESTY was inspired by her experiences singing in a church choir and her interest in the early Elizabethan period. Her husband, Ernest Drown, is a church organist who in no way resembles the grouchy Master Kenton.Grade 5-9 Having witnessed the murder of her father, Alice Tuckfield flees to York in search of a family friend. There she is befriended by some members of the York Minster Boys' Choir, who disguise her as a boy and sneak her into the choir. Alice's new identity becomes more than a joke when she discovers that her father's murderers are searching for her and that one of the priests at the cathedral was also involved in the murder plot. The suspense in Hilgartner's gripping mystery is balanced by the fascinating details of daily life at the York Minster during the Elizabethan era. The characterizations, especially of Alice, who must keep many secrets to protect her life; and the priests, a rather diverse group, are carefully realized. Elizabethan York, especially as Hilgartner describes it during the Christmas season, is an appealing setting. Her descriptions, while accurate, never dominate the story. This page-turner will attract readers; it may even entice some to go on to read other historical novels.

Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign.&nbsp; Once Bush was elected, she served as his chief adviser on national-security issues &#x2013; a job whose duties included harmonizing the relationship between the Secretaries of State and Defense.&nbsp; It was a role that deepened her bond with the President and ultimately made her one of his closest confidantes.<br>&nbsp;<br>With the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Rice found herself at the center of the Administration&#x2019;s intense efforts to keep America safe.&nbsp; Here, Rice describes the events of that harrowing day &#x2013; and the tumultuous days after.&nbsp; No day was ever the same.&nbsp; Additionally, Rice also reveals new details of the debates that led to the war in Afghanistan and then Iraq.<br>&nbsp;<br>The eyes of the nation were once again focused on Rice in 2004 when she appeared before the 9-11 Commission to answer tough questions regarding the country&#x2019;s preparedness for &#x2013; and immediate response to &#x2013; the 9-11 attacks.&nbsp; Her responses, it was generally conceded, would shape the nation&#x2019;s perception of the Administration&#x2019;s competence during the crisis.&nbsp; Rice conveys just how pressure-filled that appearance was and her surprised gratitude when, in succeeding days, she was broadly saluted for her grace and forthrightness.<br><br>From that point forward, Rice was aggressively sought after by the media and regarded by some as the Administration&#x2019;s most effective champion.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 2005 Rice was entrusted with even more responsibility when she was charged with helping to shape and carry forward the President&#x2019;s foreign policy as Secretary of State.&nbsp; As such, she proved herself a deft crafter of tactics and negotiation aimed to contain or reduce the threat posed by America&#x2019;s enemies.&nbsp; Here, she reveals the behind-the-scenes maneuvers that kept the world&#x2019;s relationships with Iran, North Korea and Libya from collapsing into chaos.&nbsp; She also talks about her role as a crisis manager, showing that at any hour -- and at a moment&#x2019;s notice -- she was willing to bring all parties to the bargaining table anywhere in the world.<br>&nbsp;<br><i><b>No Higher Honor</b> </i>takes the reader into secret negotiating rooms where the fates of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and Lebanon often hung in the balance, and it draws back the curtain on how frighteningly close all-out war loomed in clashes involving Pakistan-India and Russia-Georgia, and in East Africa.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Surprisingly candid in her appraisals of various Administration colleagues and the hundreds of foreign leaders with whom she dealt, Rice also offers here keen insight into how history actually proceeds.&nbsp; In<b> </b><i><b>No Higher Honor</b>,</i> she delivers<i> </i>a master class in statecraft&nbsp; -- but always in a way that reveals her essential warmth and humility, and her deep reverence for the ideals on which America was founded.</p><p><b>CONDOLEEZZA RICE</b> was the sixty-sixth U.S. Secretary of State and the first black woman to hold that office.&nbsp; Prior to that, she was the first woman to serve as National Security Advisor.&nbsp; She is a professor at Stanford University, and co-founder of the RiceHadley Group.&nbsp; Rice is also the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i><b>Extraordinary, Ordinary People: A Memoir of Family</b>. </i>1<br><br>Before the Crack in Time<br><br>In August 1998, President George H. W. Bush called and invited me to spend time with him and Mrs. Barbara Bush in Maine. I had become close to President Bush in the years after I'd served as his Soviet specialist in the National Security Council, and they had hosted me a few times before at their wonderful family home in Kennebunkport. The weathered, shingle-style house, decorated in calming pastel chintz, has an elegant yet understated decor and a spectacular view of the ocean. I'm not all that fond of being in the water. But I love to look at it, and there isn't a prettier place to view the Atlantic than Walker's Point. I promptly accepted the invitation.<br><br>Driving along the rocky New England coast to the entrance of the property, I was struck by two flags flying over the compound: the Texas state flag for the governor and the Stars and Stripes for the former President. (The Florida state flag would later join them when Jeb Bush was elected governor.) It was a subtle reminder that this was no ordinary family and it would be no ordinary weekend.<br><br>The elder Bush didn't hide his desire to get me together with his son George just so we could get to know each other better and talk a little about foreign policy. Before a casual lobster dinner that night, I joined Governor Bush on the back porch, where he told me that he was confident of reelection in November and that if he won impressively (which he fully expected), he'd likely run for the presidency.<br><br>A run for the White House by the Texas governor struck me as having long odds for success. President Clinton's years had been morally tarnished but peaceful and relatively prosperous. The governor was untested and would likely face a real pro in Vice President Al Gore. I was too polite to say those things that night, but I sure thought them.<br><br>Throughout the weekend, while fishing (he fished, I sat in the boat and watched) or exercising side by side in the small family gym on the compound, we talked about Russia, China, and Latin America. He wanted to start thinking about what to do in foreign policy if he got elected. I soon realized that he knew our southern neighbors, particularly Mexico, far better than I did. I made a mental note to read a few articles about Mexico when I got back to my home in California.<br><br>But we also talked about other things. He was interested in my upbringing in segregated Birmingham. I was attracted to his passion for improving education for disadvantaged youth. We compared notes on the problems of college admission and affirmative action. I was more traditional in my support of race-based admission; he'd tried to increase diversity at the University of Texas by other means. He proudly said that he would likely receive half of the Hispanic vote and more than a quarter of the African American vote.<br><br>I liked him. He was funny and irreverent but serious about policy. We e_mailed back and forth several times during the fall, mostly friendly chitchat about whatever was in the news-the growing conflict in the Balkans or the Clinton administration's efforts to expand NATO. Then, a couple of days after the November election and the landslide victory Governor Bush had hoped for, I received a note from him. He wanted to follow international events more closely.<br><br>Early in March 1999, Karl Rove, the governor's political advisor, called to ask if I'd come down to Austin and speak with the governor about the upcoming campaign. "Will you book a hotel room for me?" I asked.<br><br>"You won't need a hotel," he replied. "The governor wants you to stay at the residence." It was a signal that he expected me to support his campaign, which was quickly becoming a serious endeavor. A few weeks later, when my picture appeared on the front page of the New York Times as a member of the "exploratory committee" dedicated to electing George W. Bush President of the United States, I was momentarily stunned by the sudden exposure but committed to the cause.<br><br>My father was the first person I called after the governor asked me to join his campaign. John Wesley Rice, Jr., loved politics. He watched news shows, particularly C-SPAN, for hours at a time, and had been a loyal Republican ever since a clerk affiliated with the Grand Old Party had helped him register to vote in segregated Alabama. My father could barely contain his excitement.<br><br>The campaign itself proved professionally fulfilling, but early on I realized that it would require my full-time focus. For six years I had been the provost-the chief operating officer-of Stanford University. I was ready to step down independent of the chance to join the Bush campaign. Foreign policy would be the governor's Achilles' heel against more seasoned candidates in the primaries and eventually in the general election. I knew that George W. Bush would look to me to help answer the inevitable questions about his readiness to assume the mantle of commander in chief.<br><br>Throughout 1999 I worked to assemble a small group of foreign policy specialists to develop policy for the governor. My first call was to Paul Wolfowitz, who had been ambassador to Indonesia under President Ronald Reagan and under secretary for policy in the Pentagon during George H. W. Bush's administration. Paul was a cerebral, almost otherworldly intellectual. He'd done his undergraduate work at Cornell and gone on to complete a PhD in the intense academic environment of the University of Chicago. Though Paul had already had a distinguished public policy career, he was really most comfortable debating ideas. We'd been friends since the 1980s, and when I asked him to join me as cochair of the foreign policy group, he readily did so.<br><br>Richard Armitage and Stephen Hadley had also been in the first Bush administration. Rich was a muscular, stout former naval officer who had served in Vietnam and specialized in Asian affairs. Many people believed that the Rambo character had been based on Rich. Yet, there was another side to him: he and his wife had adopted numerous special- needs kids. He was Colin Powell's best friend, a fact that would later lead to considerable conflict within the administration.<br><br>Steve was a quiet, Yale-trained lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, who at the time wore horn-rimmed glasses. He was smart and methodical, and when there was real work to be produced for the campaign (rather than just things to be said and debated), we all looked to Steve to write the first draft of the paper. He did so selflessly and effectively.<br><br>Robert Zoellick, Robert Blackwill, and I had worked closely together during the extraordinary days of 1989-1991 at the end of the Cold War. They were among the best policy engineers I had ever known, capable of conceiving of a solution and then actually implementing it. Zoellick had been Secretary of State James Baker's closest aide at the State Department and the architect of many important initiatives concerning Central America and Europe. He had led the three-member U.S. delegation to the talks on German unification on which I had been the White House representative.<br><br>Bob Blackwill had been my boss for a while at the NSC the first time around as special assistant for European and Soviet affairs. He'd held numerous high-level positions. He was from Kansas, with very traditional values and a wicked sense of humor. But he could be abrasive and impatient, and he made enemies. Some thought that Bob would be high maintenance, but he would be valuable to the governor, and we were good enough friends to speak honestly about any problems that might arise.<br><br>I asked Richard Perle to join the group to represent the right wing of the Republican foreign policy establishment. Perle had been the bane of the party's foreign policy traditionalists such as Brent Scowcroft and Henry Kissinger. He had a well-deserved reputation for ruthlessness too. But Governor Bush needed all elements of the party united behind him, and the group that I assembled was broadly representative enough to demonstrate his commitment to a foreign policy big tent. Dov Zakheim, who did most of the work supporting our Pentagon reform plans, rounded out the group. And we were able, too, to draw on the regional expertise of others such as Jendayi Frazer, who developed our Africa policy.<br><br>In general, we got along well. My job was to organize the group and to deal with the personalities and egos-to keep everyone on board so that we could concentrate on the governor's campaign, not ourselves. If there was any resentment of my role (I had been the most junior of those who had served together in George H. W. Bush's administration), I couldn't tell. In any case, they all knew that I was the one who was closest to the governor. I was the point of access. We worked smoothly and with little drama, just getting the job done in standing Sunday- night phone calls to coordinate requests, policy positions, and responses for Governor Bush.<br><br>Just for fun we decided to adopt a nickname and called ourselves the Vulcans, after the Roman God and symbol of my home city of Birmingham, Alabama. The name meant nothing more than that, but many a conspiracy theorist tried to divine some deeper significance.<br><br>The work in the campaign was proceeding well. I made frequent visits to Austin to brief the candidate, developed policy papers on a half- dozen major initiatives, and helped write a couple of major speeches. I also began doing press appearances on behalf of candidate Bush. The question was always the same: "What makes you think that the one-term governor of Texas is ready to be President of the United States?"<br><br>My first televised interview was on Chris Matthews's Hardball in June. Chris was a relentlessly challenging interviewer who rarely gave a guest time to really answer a question. Asked at one point whether George W. Bush's being in the Oval Office would be "on-the-job training," I pointed out that my candidate was already dealing with considerable complexity as governor of Texas. Texas is a big, complicated state, and the person running it has to be able to ask the right questions, digest information, stick to principles, and make decisions. The Texas governor has to be tough.<br><br>Chris, sensing that I was contrasting George W. Bush's readiness with that of Bill Clinton when he had first run for President, said, "Right. You sound like the wife of the governor in Primary Colors where she said, 'And he's governor of a real state, not Arkansas.'_" I don't know where it came from, but I shot back, "I come from Alabama, so I'm not going to talk about what real states are." Chris broke up laughing, and I thought that I'd passed my first media test on the campaign trail.<br><br>Anyone who is interested in politics should work on the ground floor of a campaign at least once. Early on we got stuck in traffic jams and carried our own bags. The crowds were enthusiastic but, in some places, quite small. The music track that introduced the governor at campaign rallies included Stevie Wonder's "Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)." I never understood why that song was chosen, but to this day I can't listen to it without vivid memories of stadiums, auditoriums, and cowboy bars full of early believers in George W. Bush.<br><br>I loved the pace and the sense of being a part of an adventure. Life had settled into a nice post-provost pattern, and I was quite content. When I arranged to have George W. Bush meet my father during a trip to Palo Alto in July of 1999, Daddy was hooked. He peppered me every night with questions about campaign strategy that I couldn't answer: "How in the world did we screw up in New Hampshire? George Bush isn't getting through to people that he is going to be a different kind of Republican. That's what people need to know!" He admired Governor Bush and was very proud of my association with the campaign.<br><br>In February 2000 I was back home, helping to rally the troops for the California primary in the wake of the disasters in New Hampshire and Michigan. I was getting ready to do an interview with a reporter named Ann Dowd for a profile of me. Ann had gone to interview my father that morning and was in the house when suddenly my father suffered cardiac arrest. She called 911 and then my longtime assistant, Marilyn Stanley. I was in a meeting, but Marilyn burst in and said that something had happened to my father and he was not breathing. I asked my assistant Ruth Elliot to come with me, rushed out, and sped to the house. It looked like a scene from ER. Daddy was on the floor, and they were shocking his heart. I heard the medic say, "I have a weak pulse." We all rushed to the hospital and waited. It hadn't been a heart attack, but his heart had stopped long enough to cause what his physician called an "anoxic brain event." Essentially, he'd been deprived of oxygen to his brain and was now in a coma. No one could say what the prognosis was.<br><br>Daddy continued in a coma for about a week and then began to stir. But he'd sustained significant brain damage. He never fully recovered, but he fought to live. Several times he was near death and refused to go. As I watched this giant of a man who'd loved me more than anyone in the world approach the end, it was hard to find much good in life. It seemed so unfair that I could no longer share stories of the campaign with my father. Here I was at the height of my professional career, and my father couldn't enjoy it with me. Not surprisingly, my absences from home became a source of guilt, and the campaign, which had been such a wonderful magical mystery tour, became something of a slog.<br><br>I kept going and told myself that Daddy undoubtedly approved of my decision to keep my commitment to the campaign. Slowly the governor was climbing in the polls, and he clearly had a real chance to be President. But we had not erased the questions about his foreign policy competence. In fact, early in the campaign, one particular misstep created a deep hole, and it took a while to climb out of it.<br><br>I arrived at the Austin airport one November evening in 1999, and my cell phone was going crazy. It was Joel Shin, an incredibly dedicated young man who actually slept in the campaign office. (Joshua Bolten, the policy director for the campaign and later deputy chief of staff, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and chief of staff, finally made him get an apartment.) Joel asked if I'd seen the governor's interview with Andy Hiller. I said that I'd been on the plane and hadn't. He read the transcript. My heart sank. "Can you name the president of Taiwan?" Answer: "Lee." "Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan?" Answer: "General." "And the prime minister of India?" No answer.<br><br>"Well, that reads pretty badly," I commented.<br><br>"It's worse," Joel said.

But learning about his life and understanding his importance has always proven difficult, as our only source of knowledge comes from the biography of him written by his followers, the reliability of which has been questioned by Western scholars. This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> provides a superb introduction to the major aspects of Muhammad's life and its importance, providing both Muslim and Western historical perspectives. It explains the prominent roles that Muhammad's persona has played in the Islamic world throughout history, from the medieval to the modern period. The book also sheds light on modern controversies such as the <em>Satanic Verses</em>, for which author Salman Rushdie was condemned for blasphemy, and the uproar over Danish cartoons of Muhammad, which triggered violent protests around the world. As these recent events show, whatever the truth about Muhammad's life, his persona still plays a crucial role in Muslim life and civilization.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions </strong>offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

A friend came up with a name for them-the School of the Holy Ghost-and for three decades they exchanged letters, ardently read one another's books, and grappled with what one of them called a "predicament shared in common."</p><p>A pilgrimage is a journey taken in light of a story; and in <i>The Life You Save May Be Your Own</i> Paul Elie tells these writers' story as a pilgrimage from the God-obsessed literary past of Dante and Dostoevsky out into the thrilling chaos of postwar American life. It is a story of how the Catholic faith, in their vision of things, took on forms the faithful could not have anticipated. And it is a story about the ways we look to great books and writers to help us make sense of our experience, about the power of literature to change-to save-our lives.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Elie</b>, an editor at FSG, has written for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, and <i>Commonweal</i>. He lives in Manhattan.</p><b>The Life You Save May Be Your Own</b><br><b>ONE</b><i><b>Experience</b></i>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>T</b>he night the earthquake struck San Francisco--April 18, 1906--Dorothy Day was there. Startled awake, she lay alone in bed in the dark in the still-strange house, trying to understand what was happening and what it meant, for she was confident that it had a meaning, a significance beyond itself.Some years later she described that night in her autobiography. By then she was known as an organizer and agitator, a living saint, the prioress of the Bowery. But she saw herself as a journalist, first of all, and gave a journalist's eyewitness account of the event, which had brought on the most haunting of her early "remembrances of God.""The earthquake started with a deep rumbling and the convulsions of the earth started afterward, so that the earth became a sea which rocked our house in a most tumultuous manner. There was a large windmill and water tank in back of the house and I can remember the splashing of the water from the tank on top of our roof."She was eight years old, the third child of four. Her family had moved from New York to Oakland earlier in the year after her father, a journalist, found work with one of the local papers. Back in Brooklyn she had shared a bedroom with their Irish servant girl. Here she shared a room with her baby sister, who slept in her arms."My father took my brothers from their beds and rushed to the front door, where my mother stood with my sister, whom she had snatched from me. I was left in a big brass bed, which rolled back and forth on a polished floor."Before getting into bed she had knelt at the bedside to say her prayers. Of all her family, she alone was religious: she prayed in school, sang hymns with neighbors, went to church by herself because the others would not go. She was "disgustingly, proudly pious."In bed, however, she would have nightmares about God, "a great noise that became louder and louder, and approached nearer and nearer to me until I woke up sweating with fear and shrieking for my mother." And that night, alone in the dark on the big rolling bed, shaken by the earth, left behind by her mother and father, she felt God upon her once again, a figure stalking her in the dark.Or was that night the first time? "Even as I write this I am wondering if I had these nightmares before the San Francisco earthquake or afterward. The very remembrance of the noise, which kept getting louder and louder, and the keen fear of death, makes me think now that it might have been due only to the earthquake ... . They were linked up with my idea of God as a tremendous Force, a frightening impersonal God, a Hand stretched out to seize me, His child, and not in love."The earthquake went on two minutes and twenty seconds. Then it was over. The world returned to normal. She got out of bed and went down the stairs and out to the street and looked around.She was startled all over again by what she saw: buildings wobbling on their foundations, smoke rising from small fires, parents calming strange children and passing jugs of water back and forth. People were helping one another.For two days refugees from the city came to Oakland in boats across San Francisco Bay, making camp in a nearby park. The people of Oakland helped them--the men pitching tents and contriving lean-tos, the women cooking and lending their spare clothing. What did Dorothy Day do? She stood on the street, watching, and felt her fear and loneliness drawn out of her by what she saw."While the crisis lasted, people loved each other," she wrote in her autobiography. "It was as though they were united in Christian solidarity. It makes one think of how people could, if they would, care for each other in times of stress, unjudgingly in pity and love."&nbsp;<br>A whole life is prefigured in that episode. In a moment in history--front-page news--Dorothy Day felt the fear of God and witnessed elemental, biblicalcharity, the remedy for human loneliness. All her life she would try to recapture the sense of real and spontaneous community she felt then, and would strive to reform the world around her so as to make such community possible.From the beginning, she had the gift of good timing, a knack for situating herself and her story in a larger story. Her first significant religious experience took place during the first great event of the American century, a cataclysm in the city named for St. Francis, the patron saint of "unjudging pity and love" for one's neighbor.Moreover, it took place at a moment of great change (seismic change, one might say) in religion in America, and also in the interpretation of religion--changes to which she would spend the rest of her life responding.There is little question that America at the turn of the century was a religious place. The question, then as now, was this: religious how?At the time, the answer to the question was usually theological, grounded in stock ideas about Catholicism and Protestantism that had been developing since the sixteenth century. Catholics (it was thought) were traditional, communal, submissive to higher authority, taking faith at second hand from pope and clergy, whereas the Protestant was individualistic, improvisatory, devoted to progress, bent on having a direct experience of God, obedient to no authority save the Bible and the individual conscience.From the time of Columbus, according to this scheme, which was accepted by Catholics and Protestants alike, the religious history of America was a running conflict between Catholic missionaries, who saw America as an annex of Catholic Europe, and Protestant pioneers, who saw it as a frontier to be settled according to the directives in the Bible.In the nineteenth century Protestantism became dominant, and religion in America came to be characterized by the rivalry between different Protestant churches, whose circuit-riding evangelists would travel on horseback from one town to the next, each of them preaching a creed and a way of life that he claimed was more faithful to the Gospel than those his competitors were offering. Thus the country, discovered by Catholics, was settled by Protestants, whose work ethic became the basis of the national character.Around 1900, however, the situation began to change. Because of immigration from Europe the Roman Catholic Church was suddenly the largest single church in America, with twelve million members. Taken all together, Protestants outnumbered Catholics seven to one, but when they thought of themselves separately, denominationally--as Baptists, Presbyterians, Unitarians,Methodists, and the like--they were outnumbered by Catholics, more of whom arrived each day.As Catholics settled in New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans, and other cities, the emphasis in American religion shifted from village and town to the metropolis. The spectacle of poor, dirty, ill-nourished people making camp on the outskirts of the city--such as the people Dorothy Day saw displaced by the San Francisco earthquake--became a familiar one, the subject of countless cautionary tales told among Protestants. And because so many of those people were Catholics, immigrant Catholics <i>were</i> the poor in the Protestant mind, and Protestant leaders, to care for them, devised the "social gospel," which sought to apply the New Testament to modern city life.Competition between different Protestant churches, then, was overlaid by the competition between Protestants and Catholics, each group a majority that felt like a minority.At the same time, conventional notions of Catholicism and Protestantism were being upended by the best and the brightest of the Protestant elite, in ways that challenged the standard account of American religious history and the usual understanding of religion generally.In <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> (1902) William James, who had had a religious experience all alone on a mountaintop after a long hike, defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they consider the divine." For making the solitary individual the measure of religion, James is generally credited with shifting the study of religion in America away from institutions and toward experience. But his method of jumbling together believers of all sorts was just as important. He assembled his lectures from newspaper clippings about odd religious occurrences, and in his view the familiar distinctions between Protestants and Catholics, poets and saints, self-taught preachers and learned divines, were less telling than those between different religious temperaments: the "sick-souled" and the "healthy-minded," or the "once-born" and the "twice-born."Meanwhile, James's Harvard colleague Henry Adams was being born again. In France in 1895 Adams, whose chronicle of the history of America ran to nine volumes, had undergone a religious conversion of sorts--not to God or Christ but to a mystical sense of history grounded in the Middle Ages and epitomized by the order and beauty and fixity, the sheer absoluteness, of the great French cathedrals. Declaring himself "head of the ConservativeChristian Anarchists, a party numbering one member," Adams wrote two books in which he sought to impress his vision of things upon the reader as boldly as possible. First came <i>Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres</i> (1904), which is not so much a work of history as an imaginative pilgrimage, in which Adams slips into the skin of a French peasant who, in his view, saw and felt and understood life more directly than the stereotypical industrial-age American. Three years later came <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i>, Adams's third-person account of himself as a representative American man called Adams--whose problem, as h...</p><h2>Affinity</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Gothic tale, psychological study, puzzle narrative...This is gripping, astute fiction that feeds the mind and senses.&#x201d;&#x2014;</b><i><b>The Seattle Times </b></i><br><br>An upper-class woman recovering from a suicide attempt, Margaret Prior has begun visiting the women&#x2019;s ward of Millbank prison, Victorian London&#x2019;s grimmest jail, as part of her rehabilitative charity work. Amongst Millbank&#x2019;s murderers and common thieves, Margaret finds herself increasingly fascinated by on apparently innocent inmate, the enigmatic spiritualist Selina Dawes. Selina was imprisoned after a s�ance she was conducting went horribly awry, leaving an elderly matron dead and a young woman deeply disturbed. Although initially skeptical of Selina&#x2019;s gifts, Margaret is soon drawn into a twilight world of ghosts and shadows, unruly spirits and unseemly passions, until she is at last driven to concoct a desperate plot to secure Selina&#x2019;s freedom, and her own.<p>As in her noteworthy deput, <i>Tipping the Velvet</i>, Sarah Waters brilliantly evokes the sights and smells of a moody and beguiling nineteenth-century London, and proves herself yet again a storyteller, in the words of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, of "startling power."</p></p><p><i>Affinity</i> is a tale of power and possession that Henry James himself might admire. In her first novel, <i>Tipping the Velvet</i>, Sarah Waters explored secrets and longing--capping off this lesbian romp with a utopian-socialist vision. Her intricate follow-up is just as sensual but infinitely darker, its moral more difficult to descry. Its stylistic and psychological rewards, however, are visible at every turn, the author's persuasive imagination matched by her gift for storytelling. <p> In late September 1874, Margaret Prior makes her way through the pentagons of London's Millbank Prison, a place of fearful symmetry and endless corridors. This plain woman on the verge of 30 has come to comfort those behind bars, several of whom Waters brings to instant, sad life. And our Lady Visitor plans to take her role dead seriously, having recovered from two years of nervous indolence in her family's Chelsea house. One person, however, makes her job a passion. Opening an inspection slit (or "eye" as these devices are known), Margaret hears "a <i>perfect</i> sigh, like a sigh in a story." Peering inward, she's confronted by the most erotic of visions--a woman turned toward the sun, caressing her cheek with a forbidden violet: "As I watched, she put the flower to her lips, and breathed upon it, and the purple of the petals gave a quiver and seemed to glow..." </p><p> Selina Dawes may indeed have the face of a Crivelli angel, but this medium is in for fraud and assault, her last session having gone very badly indeed. Suffice it to say that the first full encounter between these two very different women is enthralling. "You think spiritualism a kind of fancy," Selina riddles. "Doesn't it seem to you, now you are here, that <i>anything</i> might be real, since Millbank is?" And soon enough Margaret receives several viable signs of the supernatural: a locket disappears from her room, flowers mysteriously appear, and her dazzling friend knows everything about her. Strangest of all, Selina seems to love her. </p><p> As Margaret records her weekly prison forays, her own past comes into focus, notably her plans to travel to Italy with her first love (who is now her sister-in-law). But her current journal, she convinces herself, is to be very different from her last one, which "took as long to burn as human hearts, they say, do take." Meanwhile, Waters offers a narrative two-for-one, placing Margaret's diary cheek by jowl with Selina's chronicle of her pre-Millbank existence. This dispassionate, staccato record initially suggests that we can separate truth from desire. Or can we? What Waters's haunting creation leaves us with is a more painful reality--that knowledge and belief are entirely different things. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p><b>Sarah Waters&nbsp;</b>is the<i>&nbsp;New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Paying Guests</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Little Stranger</i>,<i>The Night Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fingersmith</i>,<i>&nbsp;Affinity</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Tipping the Velvet</i>.&nbsp;She&nbsp;has three times been short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, has twice been a finalist for the Orange Prize, and was&nbsp;named one of&nbsp;<i>Granta</i>&#x2019;s best&nbsp;young British&nbsp;novelists, among other distinctions.

"Malintzin," at least, was what the Indians called her. The Spanish called her do�a Marina, and she has become known to posterity as La Malinche. As Malinche, she has long been regarded as a traitor to her people, a dangerously sexy, scheming woman who gave Cort�s whatever he wanted out of her own self-interest.</p><p>The life of the real woman, however, was much more complicated. She was sold into slavery as a child, and eventually given away to the Spanish as a concubine and cook. If she managed to make something more out of her life--and she did--it is difficult to say at what point she did wrong. In getting to know the trials and intricacies with which Malintzin's life was laced, we gain new respect for her steely courage, as well as for the bravery and quick thinking demonstrated by many other Native Americans in the earliest period of contact with Europeans.</p><p>In this study of Malintzin's life, Camilla Townsend rejects all the previous myths and tries to restore dignity to the profoundly human men and women who lived and died in those days. Drawing on Spanish and Aztec language sources, she breathes new life into an old tale, and offers insights into the major issues of conquest and colonization, including technology and violence, resistance and accommodation, gender and power.</p></p><p>The complicated life of the real woman who came to be known as La Malinche.Camilla Townsend is associate professor of history at Rutgers University, in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

She feels it was a great place to grow up since school field trips usually went to the national museums. She also feels lucky to have wonderfully supportive parents who were able to indulge her and her sister, Heidi&#39;s, creative desires. Susan attended the Maryland Institute, College of Art, in Baltimore, Maryland, and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Illustration in 1983. After a couple years of freelance graphic design work in DC, and various part-time jobs, she traveled to Maine on a summer vacation with a high-school friend. There she met a &#34;really cute guy&#34; who was working on his dad&#39;s fishing wharf for the summer. Susan and Tom Allen are now married. In the years that have followed that first introduction (Thanks, Kathy!), Susan and Tom have stayed in New England. They lived seven years in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, making many friends in the rich artistic community. In 1994 they moved to Berwick, Maine, where three years later their son, Sam, was born. Now they live just up the road from that wharf where they first met in South Harpswell. Two big ol&#39; pups, Daisy and Hassan, complete their family. Susan has received numerous awards for her quilts, including a New Hampshire State Council on the Arts and National Endowment for the Arts Artist Opportunity Grant in 1994. Her 7 1/2 minutes of fame came in 1993 when New Hampshire Public Television did a short program on her and her artwork. She figures she still has the other 7 1/2 minutes to burn.In this guide to free-spirited fabric collage, Susan Carlson begins by chronicling her struggles to achieve a less restricted approach in her work. She proceeds to share the discoveries that transformed her technique through a series of projects (each accompanied by a pattern) that increase in difficulty, gradually acclimatizing the reader to her unique method of quilt construction. The first project is a simple spiral quilt, constructed using the essential components of Carlson's approach: drawing an underlying image, selecting fabrics, and gluing them in place. More complex projects include a sun and moon portrait, a beta fish design, and a mandala quilts. Carlson's instructions go far beyond methodical, step-by-step directions as she includes anecdotes about her personal experiences, design advice, and ideas for how to make your collaged quilts unique. The artist's gallery at the end of the book, full of vibrantly colorful quilts inspired by a wide variety of subjects (from freshly caught fish to smiling pumpkins and beetles), will undoubtedly inspire you to loosen up your collage approach as well.

Now, in this electrifying new novel, he reveals the story of one of the bloodiest conflicts of the Pacific, the epic struggle for Guadalcanal...Daredevil pilot Charles Galloway learns the hard way how to command a fighter squadron. Lt. Joe Howard teams up with the Coastwatchers. Jack &#34;No Middle Initial&#34; Stecker leads his infantry battalion into the thickest of fighting, at a terrible price. And Navy Captain Pickering grabs a helmet and rifle to join the ranks at Guadalcanal...</p><p><b>W. E. B. Griffin</b>&nbsp;is the author of seven bestselling series: The Corps, Brotherhood of War, Badge of Honor, Men at War, Honor Bound, Presidential Agent, and now Clandestine Operations. He lives in Fairhope, Alabama, and Buenos Aires, Argentina.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;This latest volume in the Corps series takes the U.S. Marines from Midway to Guadalcanal. Navy Cpt. Fleming Pickering travels to various headquarters, reporting events to the secretary of the Navy; recently promoted Cpt. Charley Galloway forms a new fighter squadron; Sgt. John Moore is a Japanese-language expert on a top-secret intelligence assignment. Griffin ( Counterattack ) employs a surprisingly effective alternative to military fiction's usual foxhole-and-cockpit perspective--he places the characters on the fringes rather than in the thick of the action, skirting familiar events and offering opportunities to explore the Pacific War's less familiar byways. As he creates a framework of coherent subplots and interesting personalities, he reveals WW II arcana, including the principles for establishing travel priorities and the status of enlisted Marine pilots. Sure to be welcomed by series fans, Battleground is also likely to inspire new readers to seek its predecessors. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cut and Fold Techniques for Pop-Up Designs</h2><p>Introducing techniques for making pop-ups from one sheet of card, the third title in this series on paper engineering takes folding techniques into the third dimension.<br><br>Each chapter introduces a new technical idea and show how that technique can be adapted in many different ways, or combined with techniques from earlier chapters.

Burn Your Portfolio teaches the real-world practices, professional do's and don'ts, and unwritten rules of business that most designers, photographers, web designers, copy writers, programmers, and architects only learn after putting in years of experience on the job.<br> <br>Michael Janda, owner of the Utah-based design firm Riser, uses humor to dispense nugget after nugget of hard-won advice collected over the last decade from the personal successes and failures he has faced running his own agency. In this surprisingly funny, but incredibly practical advice guide, Janda's advice on teamwork and collaboration, relationship building, managing clients, bidding work, production processes, and more will resonate with creative professionals of all stripes. <br> </p></p><p><p>Michael Janda has been in most positions on the graphic design world org chart over his 16-year career.

Seriously, take copious notes on the practical suggestions offered here to help steer your own career, whether it&#x2019;s your first job or your 15th freelance gig. The drama-free work approach and leadership style outlined in Burn Your Portfolio is what makes working with him and all the folks at his company, Riser, FUN and worthy of the cupcakes we send to celebrate each of our successes together.&#x201d;</p> &#x2014;Michelle Sullivan VP Digital, Kids &amp; Family Publishing and Media, National Geographic (aka 800 pound Gorilla Client) <br> &#x201c;This book should be a mandatory course at art schools...no, at all schools! The message transcends occupation; it&#x2019;s about maneuvering through the unspoken rules and dynamics of various personalities in your workplace. Mike is a perfect person to deliver this message; his long-term relationships and success of his business are the true testimony of his skills on managing up, down, and sideways. Your talent alone will take you nowhere if your character doesn&#x2019;t support it. If you want longevity in your field, this book is a must-read.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jane Bhang Consulting Art Director, Sony Pictures Entertainment <br> &#x201c;I wish I could take every designer I&#x2019;ve ever worked with and smack them over the head with this book...which would hurt, because it&#x2019;s big!

Even if you&#x2019;re a freelancer just striking out on your own&#x2014;no, especially if you are&#x2014;the insights, truisms, and humor in this book will prove to be valuable tools in your design arsenal.&#x201d; &#x2014;Marc Siry SVP, Media Products, NBC Universal <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked with Michael and Riser for many years, and the thing that differentiates Michael and his team from other agencies is their ability to speak my language versus design speak! Michael and his company Riser are not only super-creative, they are total professionals. Communication is a big reason why Michael and his team are so successful at what they do. They are good at not only listening to a client who is not a designer and is trying to convey the details of a project, but also on working with the client to get the job done well, on time, and also on budget. I can&#x2019;t think of a better person to give advice to designers who need to work with clients in the real world.&#x201d; &#x2014;Melissa Van Meter VP, Marketing &amp; Advertising, TV Guide Network <p> </p></p><h2>Telling Ain&#39;t Training, 2nd edition: Updated, Expanded, Enhanced</h2><p><p>A must have for trainers... <em>Telling Ain't Training </em>is an essential book for all learning and development professionals.

Roche, a meditation trainer for 30 years, knows how to make the uninitiated feel at ease. He debunks the stereotype that you have to follow monastic rules: you don't have to sit still, or empty your mind, or overcome your ego. "Meditation is about being intimate with your deepest self," so imposing techniques and formalities that don't fit you will just interfere. Meditation should be "a direct response to sensing some need in your body or heart ... a pleasurable indulgence ... a mini-vacation." Roche discusses the basics in a warm, friendly, question-and-answer chapter, and then teaches the stages of "getting in" to a meditation. Varied techniques and exercises let you explore what works for you. "Going Deeper" shows you how to turn details of everyday experience--such as drinking coffee--into a mini-meditation. For fun, check out "How to Make Yourself Miserable in Meditation"--for example, "Use a mantra that grates on your nerves"; "Worry about whether your chakras are balanced"; "Choose a tradition that reminds you of the worst aspects of your childhood." This book not only teaches you how to meditate; it makes the process easy and enjoyable. <i>--Joan Price</i>You've probably heard about the benefits of meditation: Sharper thinking, reduced stress, improved concentration, lower blood pressure, even increased sexual pleasure--all of these positive effects have been confirmed by science. So what's holding you back? Perhaps you don't see yourself signing up with a guru. Or twisting yourself into a lotus position while repeating a mantra. Or spending hours trying to let go of desire and empty your mind. But what if meditating were as easy and pleasurable as eating a dish of ice cream? In this uniquely accessible guide, Lorin Roche proves that meditation "is" that easy-- and even more pleasurable.<p>Roche begins by answering questions and debunking myths, most of which have to do with meditation's long association with Eastern religions. He then gives you three easy-to-follow techniques for getting started-- "the Do Nothing Technique," "Salute Each of the Senses," and "Feeling at Home Exercise"-- and shows you how to integrate "mini meditations" into spare moments of your day, from savoring your morning coffee to taking advantage of the five minutes before a meeting.

[<i>The Grip of It</i>] is the clever work of a writer who has patiently carved out her own home in contemporary fiction . . . as chilling as it is evocative." &#x2015;Laura Pearson, <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>"[<i>The Grip of It</i>] is a cerebral haunting in book form, a page-turning, suspenseful read that will stay with you long after you&#x2019;ve finished it . . . <i>The Grip of It</i> stalks the reader through its pages with a silent, grayscale terror, like the brush of a web against your cheek in the dark . . . What makes this novel so powerful is the acknowledgement that intimacy does require a trust beyond logic, that &#x201c;ruin&#x201d; can come just as easily to the guilty or the guiltless, and an embrace of the chaos is sometimes the only way to make it out to the other side." &#x2015;Matt Lewis, <i>Electric Literature</i></p><p>"Jemc adds something unique to [horror in American media] with her writing . . . To keep the tension going, Jemc never allows her readers a chance to fully know if the haunting is authentic, but it&#x2019;s not validation of the supernatural that the reader needs to enjoy this book. The pleasure of this text is in the participation of the reader, the act of taking Jemc&#x2019;s narrative gaps and her characters&#x2019; fugue states and constructing the story they want (or don&#x2019;t want) . . . Simply put, we need more books like this, books that allow us fear without forcing themselves on us with a two dimensional <i>ta-da.</i>" &#x2015;Duncan Barlow, <i>Vol. 1 Brooklyn</i></p><p>"Jemc&#x2019;s novel of literary horror is sharply written and builds compulsive momentum, alternating between James and Julie&#x2019;s points of view in short, dense chapters. The language is vivid and the syntax deliberate, building sentences that unfurl the novel&#x2019;s growing unease. A novel centered on a haunted house that will inevitably also haunt the reader, <i>The Grip of It</i> is an intensely satisfying narrative that calls into question what trust means&#x2015;of our own minds, and of the relationships around us." &#x2015;Anne Valente, <i>The Rumpus</i></p><p>"You may find <i>The Grip Of It</i> keeping you awake at night, not because it's a traditional horror novel but because Jemc effortlessly weaves threads of reality and the abstract into an unsettling lens that distorts perception itself." &#x2015;<i>The Oklahoman</i></p><p>"With an eerie quality evocative of Shirley Jackson . . . [<i>The Grip of It</i>] feels both familiar and disorienting, and both Gothic and modern &#x2015; a reflection of Jemc&#x2019;s masterful talent." &#x2015;<i>National Book Review</i> ("5 Hot Books This Week")</p><p>"[<i>The Grip of It </i>is] so immediately frightening that your conscious mind subsumes the drama and focuses on the sounds in the house, the weird laughter in the forest, the jagged writing on the walls.

Durand, Frederick Church, and others that caught the grandeur of the wilderness and that gave texture, color, and form to Irving&#x2019;s and Cooper&#x2019;s imaginings.<br><br> Here are the entrepreneurs and financiers who saw the Catskills as a way to strike it rich, plundering the resources that had been likened to &#x201c;creation,&#x201d; the Catskills&#x2019; tanneries that supplied the boots and saddles for Union troops in the Civil War . . . and the bluestone quarries whose excavated rock became the curbs and streets of the fast-growing Eastern Seaboard.&nbsp; <br><br> Here are the Catskills brought fully to life in all of their intensity, beauty, vastness, and lunacy.</p><p><b>STEPHEN M.

His application of family systems theory to congregational life has enormously clarified its operative systems and especially its emotional system. In this sequel, Richardson employs the same methodology to address the roots of personal issues that may hinder pastors&#39; ability to function effectively as leaders within their congregations, and may in fact cause them deep difficulties. He especially addresses pastors&#39; own families of origin, a major but often hidden component in how they function emotionally in their congregations. When anxiety arises, unresolved familial issues and old family patterns return, often unhelpfully. Richardson explores these patterns, how they operate in church situations, and how pastors can do their own family-of-origin assessment. His volume will become a standard tool for analysis of patterns in ministerial behavior and developing strong personal effectiveness.</p><p>Ronald W. Richardson is former Clinical Director of the North Shore Counseling Center, pastoral counselor, author of many books on family systems theory and is currently a retired pastor living in West Vancouver, BC, Canada. He is a member of various groups including North Puget Sound Presbytery, a Diplomat for American Association of Pastoral Counselors, and Clinical Member and Approved Supervisor for American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. He also held many workshops for his work in many different organizations. <p>Ronald is author of Family Ties That Bind: A Self-Help Guide to Change through Family of Origin Therapy (Self Counsel Press 1984), Birth Order and You: How Your Sex and Position in the Family Affect Your Personality and Relationships (Self Counsel Press 1990), and Creating a Healthier Church: Family Systems Theory, Leadership, and Congregational Life (Fortress Press 1996).</p></p><h2>Down to Earth: Nature&#39;s Role in American History</h2><p>In this ambitious and provocative text, environmental historian Ted Steinberg offers a sweeping history of the United States--a history that places the environment at the very center of the narrative. Now in a new edition, <em>Down to Earth </em>reenvisions the story of America "from the ground up." It reveals how focusing on plants, animals, climate, and other ecological factors can radically change the way that we think about the past. Examining such familiar topics as colonization, the industrial revolution, slavery, the Civil War, and the emergence of consumer culture, Steinberg recounts how the natural world influenced the course of human history. From the colonists' attempts to impose order on the land to modern efforts to sell the wilderness as a consumer good, he reminds readers that many critical episodes in U.S. history were, in fact, environmental events. The text highlights the ways in which Americans have attempted to reshape and control nature, from Thomas Jefferson's surveying plan, which divided the national landscape into a grid, to the transformation of animals, crops, and even water into commodities.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ted Steinberg</strong> is Adeline Barry Davee Distinguished Professor of History and Law at Case Western Reserve University.<br><br>"The reason I assign <em>Down to Earth</em> again and again is that it is simply the best text available--far and away--for American environmental history. Compared to its competitors, it is superior in its writing, its coverage, and its vision--not to mention its cost."--Adam M.

Still, that crushing defeat produces one small miracle: Jacen Solo is alive. Yet he can scarcely imagine himself in stranger circumstances.<br><br>The young Jedi Knight is in the care of Vergere, a fascinating creature of mystery and power, her intentions hard to fathom, her cruelties rarely concealed.

And there are others watching Jacen&#x2019;s process closely, waiting patiently for the moment when he will be ready for their own dire purposes. Now, all is in shadows.

When another minute in the white might kill him, the Embrace of Pain eases enough to slide him back into the reality of the room, of the ship; when the pain has crackled so hot for so long that his overloaded nerves and brain have been scorched too numb to feel it, the Embrace of Pain lowers him entirely to the floor, where he can even sleep for a time, while other devices&#x2014;or creatures, since he cannot tell the difference anymore, since he is no longer sure that there is any difference&#x2014;bathe him and tend wounds scraped or torn or slashed into his flesh by the Embrace&#x2019;s grip, and still more creature-devices crawl over him like spider-roaches, injecting him with nutrients and enough water to maintain his life.<br><br>Even without the Force, his Jedi training gives him ways to survive the pain; he can drive his mind through a meditative cycle that builds a wall of discipline between his consciousness and the white. Though his body still suffers, he can hold his mind outside the pain. But this wall of discipline doesn&#x2019;t last forever, and the Embrace of Pain is patient.<br><br>It erodes his mental walls with the inanimate persistence of waves against a cliff; the Embrace&#x2019;s arcane perception somehow lets it know that he has defended himself, and its efforts slowly gather like a storm spinning up into a hurricane until it batters down his walls and slashes once more into everything Jacen is. Only then, only after it has pushed him to the uttermost limit of his tolerance then blasted him beyond that limit into whole new galaxies of pain, will the Embrace slowly relent.<br><br>He feels as if the white is eating him&#x2014;as if the Embrace eats his pain, but never so much that he can&#x2019;t recover to feed it again. He is being managed, tended like wander-kelp on a Chadian deepwater ranch. His existence has become a tidal rhythm of agony that sweeps in, reaches an infinite crest, then rolls out again just far enough that he might catch his breath; the Embrace is careful not to let him drown.<br><br>Sometimes, when he slips down from the white, Vergere is there. Sometimes she crouches at his side with the unblinking predatory patience of a hawk-bat; sometimes she stalks around the chamber on her back-bent legs like a dactyl stork wading through a swamp. Often, she is incongruously kind to him, tending his raw flesh herself with oddly comforting efficiency; he sometimes wonders if she would do more, would say more, if not for the constant monitoring stares of the eyestalks that dangle from the ceiling.<br><br>But mostly he sits, or lies, waiting. Naked, blood seeping from his wrists and ankles. More than naked: utterly hairless. The living machines that tend to his body also pluck out his hairs. All of them: head, arms, legs, pubis, armpits. Eyebrows. Eyelashes.<br><br>Once he asked, in his thin, weakly croaking voice, &#x201c;How long?&#x201d;<br><br>Her response was a blank stare. He tried again. &#x201c;How long . . . have I been here?&#x201d;<br><br>She made the liquid ripple of her flexible arms that he usually took for a shrug. &#x201c;How long you have been here is as irrelevant as where you are. Time and place belong to the living, little Solo. They have nothing to do with you, nor you with them.&#x201d;<br><br>His questions always meet with answers like this one; eventually he stops asking. Questions require strength, and he has none to spare.<br><br>&#x201c;Our masters serve stern gods,&#x201d; she said, the second or fifth or tenth time he awoke to find her at his side. &#x201c;The True Gods decree that life is suffering, and give us pain to demonstrate their truth. Some among our masters seek favor with the True Gods by seeking pain; Domain Shai was legendary for this. They used the Embrace of Pain the way you or I might take a bath. Perhaps they hoped that by punishing themselves, they might avert the punishments of the True Gods. In this, one must suppose they were . . . ah, disappointed. Or perhaps&#x2014;as Domain Shai&#x2019;s detractors like to whisper&#x2014;they grew to enjoy the pain. Pain can be a drug, Jacen Solo. Do you understand this yet?&#x201d;<br><br>Vergere seemed never to care if he didn&#x2019;t answer; she seemed perfectly content to prattle away endlessly on any random subject, as though interested in nothing beyond the sound of her own voice&#x2014;but if he so much as lifted his head, as soon as he croaked an answer or murmured a question, the subject somehow turned to pain.<br><br>They had plenty to talk about; Jacen had learned a great deal about pain.<br><br>His first actual clue to the lesson of pain came once when he lay upon the corded floor, trembling with exhaustion. The branchlike grips of the Embrace of Pain still held him, but loosely, maintaining contact, no more. They hung in slack spirals overhead, dangling from bunched, knotted bundles of vegetative muscle that shifted and squirmed above the leather-barked ceiling of the chamber.<br><br>These periods of rest hurt Jacen almost as much as the Embrace&#x2019;s torment: his body slowly but inexorably dragged itself back into shape, resocketing his joints and achingly releasing the overstretched tension of his muscles. And without the constant agony of the Embrace of Pain, he could think of nothing but Anakin, of the gaping wound that Anakin&#x2019;s death had opened in his life&#x2014;and of what Anakin&#x2019;s death had begun to do to Jaina, driving her toward the dark&#x2014;and of how his parents must be suffering, having lost both their sons&#x2014;<br><br>More to distract himself than out of any desire for conversation, he had rolled over to face Vergere and asked, &#x201c;Why are you doing this to me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This?&#x201d; Vergere gazed at him steadily. &#x201c;What am I doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No&#x2014;&#x201d; He closed his eyes, organizing pain-scattered thoughts, then opened them again. &#x201c;No, I mean the Yuuzhan Vong. The Embrace of Pain. I&#x2019;ve been through a breaking,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The breaking makes a kind of sense, I guess. But this . . .&#x201d;<br><br>His voice broke despairingly, but he caught himself, and held his tongue until he could control it. Despair is of the dark side. &#x201c;Why are they torturing me?&#x201d; he asked, clearly and simply. &#x201c;No one even asks me anything . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why is a question that is always deeper than its answer,&#x201d; Vergere said. &#x201c;Perhaps you should ask instead: what? You say torture, you say breaking. To you, yes. To our masters?&#x201d; She canted her head, and her crest splayed orange. &#x201c;Who knows?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t torture? You should try it from my side,&#x201d; Jacen said with a feeble smile. &#x201c;In fact, I really wish you would.&#x201d;<br><br>Her chuckle chimed like a handful of glass bells. &#x201c;Do you think I haven&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen stared, uncomprehending.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps you are not being tortured,&#x201d; she said cheerily. &#x201c;Perhaps you are being taught.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen made a rusty hacking sound, halfway between a cough and a bitter laugh. &#x201c;In the New Republic,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;education doesn&#x2019;t hurt this much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d; She canted her head to the opposite angle, and her crest shimmered to green. &#x201c;That may be why your people are losing this war. The Yuuzhan Vong understand that no lesson is truly learned until it has been purchased with pain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, sure. What&#x2019;s this supposed to teach me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it what the teacher teaches?&#x201d; Vergere countered. &#x201c;Or what the student learns?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the difference?&#x201d;<br><br>The arc of her lips and the angle of her head might have added up to a smile. &#x201c;That is, itself, a question worth considering, yes?&#x201d;<br><br>There was another time&#x2014;before, after, he could never be sure. He had found himself huddled against the leathery curve of the chamber&#x2019;s wall, the Embrace&#x2019;s grips trailing upward like slack feeder vines. Vergere crouched at his side, and as consciousness trickled through him he seemed to recall that she had been coaxing him to take a sip from the stem of an elongated, gourdlike drink bulb. Too exhausted for disobedience, he tried; but the liquid within&#x2014;only water, cool and pure&#x2014;savaged his parched throat until he gagged and had to spit it out again. Patiently, Vergere had used the bulb to moisten a scrap of rag, then gave it to him to suck on until his throat loosened up enough that he could swallow.<br><br>The vast desert inside his mouth absorbed the moisture instantly, and Vergere dampened the rag again. This went on for some considerable while.<br><br>&#x201c;What is pain for?&#x201d; she murmured after a time. &#x201c;Do you ever think about that, Jacen Solo? What is its function? Many of our more devout masters believe that pain is the lash of the True Gods: that suffering is how the True Gods teach us to disdain comfort, our bodies, even life itself. For myself, I say that pain is itself a god: the taskmaster of life. Pain cracks the whip, and all that lives will move. The most basic instinct of life is to retreat from pain. To hide from it. If going here hurts, even a granite slug will go over there; to live is to be a slave to pain. To be &#x2018;beyond pain&#x2019; is to be dead, yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not for me,&#x201d; Jacen answered dully, once his throat opened enough that he could speak. &#x201c;No matter how dead you say I am, it still hurts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, well, yes. That the dead are beyond pain is only an article of faith, isn&#x2019;t it? We should say, we hope that the dead are beyond pain&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s only one way to find out for sure.&#x201d; She winked at him, smiling. &#x201c;Do you think that pain might be the ruling principle of death, as well?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think anything. I just want it to stop.&#x201d;<br><br>She turned away, making an odd snuffling sound; for half a moment Jacen wondered if his suffering might have finally touched her somehow&#x2014;wondered if she might take pity on him . . .<br><br>But when she turned back, her eyes were alight with mockery, not compassion. &#x201c;I am such a fool,&#x201d; she chimed. &#x201c;All this time, I had thought I was speaking to an adult. Ah, self-deception is the cruelest trick of all, isn&#x2019;t it? I let myself believe that you had once been a true Jedi, when in truth you are only a hatchling, shivering in the nest, squalling because your mother hasn&#x2019;t fluttered up to feed you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2014;you&#x2014;&#x201d; Jacen stammered. &#x201c;How can you&#x2014;after what you&#x2019;ve done&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What I have done? Oh, no no no, little Solo child. This is about what you have done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t done anything!&#x201d;<br><br>Vergere settled back against the chamber&#x2019;s wall a meter away. Slowly, she folded her back-bent knees beneath her, then laced her fingers together in front of her delicately whiskered mouth and stared at him over her knuckles.<br><br>After a long, long silence, during which I haven&#x2019;t done anything! echoed in his mind until Jacen&#x2019;s face burned, Vergere said, &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br><br>She leaned close, as though to share an embarrassing secret. &#x201c;Is that not the infant&#x2019;s tactic? To wail, and wail, and wail, to wriggle its fingers and kick its heels . . . hoping an adult will notice, and care for it?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen lowered his head, struggling against sudden hot tears. &#x201c;What can I do?&#x201d;<br><br>She sat back again and made more of that snuffling noise. &#x201c;Certainly, among your options is continuing to hang in this room and suffer. And so long as you do that, do you know what will happen?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen gave her a bruised look. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; she said cheerfully. She spread her hands. &#x201c;Oh, eventually, you&#x2019;ll go mad, I suppose. If you&#x2019;re lucky.

He couldn&#x2019;t face another hour in the Embrace of Pain&#x2014;she was talking about years. About decades.<br><br>About the rest of his life.<br><br>He hugged his knees and buried his face against them, grinding his eye sockets against his kneecaps as though he could squeeze the horror out of his head. He remembered Uncle Luke in the doorway of the shed on Belkadan, remembered the sadness on his face as he cut through the Yuuzhan Vong warriors who had captured Jacen, remembered the swift sure pressure as Luke gouged the slave seed out of Jacen&#x2019;s face with his cybernetic thumb.<br><br>He remembered that Uncle Luke wouldn&#x2019;t be coming for him this time. Nobody would.<br><br>Because Jacen was dead.<br><br>&#x201c;Is that why you keep coming here?&#x201d; he muttered into his folded arms. &#x201c;To gloat? To humiliate a defeated enemy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Am I gloating? Are we enemies?&#x201d; Vergere asked, sounding honestly puzzled. &#x201c;Are you defeated?&#x201d;<br><br>Her suddenly sincere tone caught him; he raised his head, and could find no mockery now in her eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That, at least, is very clear,&#x201d; she sighed. &#x201c;I give you a gift, Jacen Solo. I free you from hope of rescue. Can you not see how I am trying to help you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Help?&#x201d; Jacen coughed a bitter chuckle. &#x201c;You need to brush up your Basic, Vergere. In Basic, when we talk about the kind of things you&#x2019;ve done to me, help isn&#x2019;t the word we use.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No? Then perhaps you are correct: our difficulties may be linguistic.&#x201d; Vergere sighed again, and settled even lower, folding her arms on the floor in front of her and arranging herself on top of them in a way more feline than avian. Secondary inner lids shrouded her eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;When I was very young&#x2014;younger than you, little Solo&#x2014;I came upon a ringed moon shadowmoth at the end of its metamorphosis, still within its cocoon,&#x201d; she said distantly, a little sadly. &#x201c;I had already some touch with the Force; I could feel the shadowmoth&#x2019;s pain, its panic, its claustrophobia, its hopelessly desperate struggle to free itself. It was as though this particular shadowmoth knew I was beside it, and screamed out to me for help. How could I refuse? Shadowmoth cocoons are polychained silicates&#x2014;very, very tough&#x2014;and shadowmoths are so delicate, so beautiful: gentle creatures whose only purpose is to sing to the night sky. So I gave it what I think you mean by help: I used a small utility cutter to slice the cocoon, to help the shadowmoth get out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you didn&#x2019;t, did you? Please say you didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Jacen let his eyes drift closed, sorry already, for how he knew this story would end.<br><br>He&#x2019;d had a shadowmoth in his collection for a short time; he remembered watching the larva grow, feeling its happy satisfaction through his empathic talent as it fed on stripped insulation and crumbled duracrete; he remembered the young shadowmoth that had emerged, spreading its dusky, beautifully striated wings against the crystalline polymer of its viewcage; he remembered the shadowmoth&#x2019;s thrilling whistle of moonsong, when he had released it from its viewcage and it had soared away under the mingled glows of Coruscant&#x2019;s four moons.<br><br>He remembered the desperate panic that had beat in waves against him through the Force, the night the shadowmoth had fought free of its cocoon. He remembered his ache to help the helpless creature&#x2014;and he remembered why he hadn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t help a shadowmoth by cutting its cocoon,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It needs the effort; the struggle to break the cocoon forces ichor into its wing veins.

Designed and edited by Greg Girard and Ian Lambot, the team behind City of Darkness: Life in Kowloon Walled City, this new publication questions those myths and explores the reality behind the Walled Citys extraordinary architecture and development. Through photographs, drawings and documents, many previously unpublished, plus an extended article by Hong Kong-based writer and journalist Fionnuala McHugh, the full story is revealed.</p><p>Ian Lambot trained as an architect and worked briefly for the Richard Rogers Partnership before arriving in Hong Kong in 1979, where he lived for the next 18 years. After stints running an architectural model-making studio and working with Foster and Partners - on the early stages of the Hongkong Bank project - he set up Watermark Publications, publishing in the years since numerous books on architecture, engineering and design, including four volumes on the work of Norman Foster and, of course, City of Darkness: Life in Kowloon Walled City.He now lives in the UK, where he continues to design and publish books on subjects that interest him.

Four young people, all seasonal park employees, have disappeared, and two weeks of work by crack search-and-rescue teams have failed to turn up a single clue; investigators are unsure as to whether the four went AWOL for reasons of their own - or died in the park. Needing an out-of-park ranger to work undercover, Anna is detailed to dining room duty; but after a week of waiting tables, she knows the missing employees are only the first indication of a sickness threatening the park. Her twenty-something roommates give up their party-girl ways and panic; her new restaurant colleagues regard her with suspicion and fear. Yet when Anna&#39;s life if threatened and her temporary supervisor turns a deaf ear, she follows the scent of evil, taking a solo hike up a snowy trial to the high country, seeking answers. What awaits her is a nightmare of death and greed - and perhaps her final adventure.</p><p>When four young employees of Yosemite National Park disappear, ranger Anna Pigeon goes undercover as a waitress at the Ahwahnee Lodge to investigate. Living in the staff dorm, she soon discovers there's a connection between at least one of the missing girls, a crashed plane containing a fortune in drugs, and the outsiders who've moved into the tent cabin last occupied by a skilled climber who's also among the disappeared. The first attempt on her life doesn't scare her away, but the second is nearly fatal, and Anna's harrowing escape keeps the tension ratcheted up until the denouement. As usual, Nevada Barr turns in a well-paced thriller featuring a compelling protagonist and a strong cast of minor characters, but it's her brilliantly etched landscapes that bring readers back to this popular series again and again. <i>High Country</i> is Anna's thirteenth outing, and it's one of her strongest. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Formerly an actress and a park ranger,&nbsp;<b>Nevada Barr&nbsp;</b>is now&nbsp;an award-winning and <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling novelist and creator&nbsp;of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and numerous other books and short stories.

Fred Anderson takes readers on a remarkable journey through the vast conflict that, between 1755 and 1763, destroyed the French Empire in North America, overturned the balance of power on two continents, undermined the ability of Indian nations to determine their destinies, and lit the "long fuse" of the American Revolution. Beautifully illustrated and recounted by an expert storyteller, <i>The War That Made America</i> is required reading for anyone interested in the ways in which war has shaped the history of America and its peoples.<br><br></b></p><p>Fred Anderson is professor of history at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is the author of several books, including <i>Crucible of War</i>, which won the Francis Parkman and Mark Lynton prizes.In 1754 an uneasy balance existed on the North American continent between three great nations: France, the Iroquois Confederacy, and the British Empire. Seven years later, following the French and Indian War, only one superpower remained, England. Simon Vance handles this complex narrative with a stately intelligence, although his British accent belies the preeminence of England in this story. He pronounces the many Native American place names and French-Canadian phrases with ease. Look for a young George Washington, who learns a number of valuable lessons that will serve him well two decades later. This project coincided with a PBS documentary series and the 250th anniversary of the French and Indian War.

In selections that range from fiction to scientific speculations about thinking machines, artificial intelligence, and the nature of the brain, Hofstadter and Dennett present a variety of conflicting visions of the self and the soul as explored through the writings of some of the twentieth century&#39;s most renowned thinkers.</p><p>Ever wondered who you are? Who you <i>really</i> are? This collection of writings and reflections by some of today's most notable thinkers is designed to enliven this most central, and most baffling, question in the philosophy of mind. In some ways, the questions posed and bantered about in this book are at the heart of all philosophical reasoning. They are the ultimate questions about the self. <i>The Mind's I</i> contains an astonishing variety of approaches to answering the question, "Who am I?" Between the covers of this book one encounters the literary erudition of Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges alongside the analytic rigor of John Searle. There are sophisticated metaphorical pieces (such as "The Princess Ineffabelle" by Polish philosopher and writer Stanislaw Lem), intriguing dialogues (like Raymond Smullyan's "Is God a Taoist?"), and serious but engaging philosophical essays from a host of thinkers (see Thomas Nagel's "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"). <p> Editors Hofstadter and Dennett--leading lights in the study of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of mind--follow each selection with a short reflection designed to elaborate on their main themes. <i>The Mind's I</i> admirably broadens their fields to a more general audience. The book's essays are grouped into six categories, each successively raising the philosophical stakes by introducing new levels of complexity. Ultimately, one confronts some of the thorniest questions in modern philosophy here, such as the nature of free will, our place in the metaphysical world, and the possibility of genuine artificial intelligence. The book closes with a playful and perplexing piece by Robert Nozick, an adequate summation to <i>The Mind's I</i>. He writes, "Perhaps God has not decided yet whether he has created, in this world, a fictional world or a real one.... Which decision do you hope for?" <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>"Brilliant, shattering, mind-jolting, <i>The Mind's I</i> is a searching, probing nook--a cosmic journey of the mind--that goes deeply into the problem of self and self-consciousness as anything written in our time. From verbalizing chimpanzees to scientific speculations involving machines with souls, from the mesmerizing, maze-like fiction of Borges to the tantalizing, dreamlike fiction of Lem and Princess Ineffable, her circuits glowing read and gold, <i>The Mind's I </i> opens the mind to the Black Box of fantasy, to the windfalls of reflection, to new dimensions of exciting possibilities.<p>"Ever since David Hume declared in the 18th century that the Self is only a heap of perceptions, the poor Ego has been in a shaky conditions indeed...Mind and consciousness becomes dispensable items in our accounts of reality, ghosts in the bodily machine...Yet there are indications here and there that the tide may be tuming...and the appearance of <i>The Mind's I</i>, edited by Douglas R. Hofstadter and Daniel C. Dennett, seems a welcome sign of change."--William Barrett, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><h2>Geometry: A Comprehensive Course (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>"A lucid and masterly survey." &#x2014; <i>Mathematics Gazette</i>Professor Pedoe is widely known as a fine teacher and a fine geometer. His abilities in both areas are clearly evident in this self-contained, well-written, and lucid introduction to the scope and methods of elementary geometry. It covers the geometry usually included in undergraduate courses in mathematics, except for the theory of convex sets. Based on a course given by the author for several years at the University of Minnesota, the main purpose of the book is to increase geometrical, and therefore mathematical, understanding and to help students enjoy geometry.Among the topics discussed: the use of vectors and their products in work on Desargues' and Pappus' theorem and the nine-point circle; circles and coaxal systems; the representation of circles by points in three dimensions; mappings of the Euclidean plane, similitudes, isometries, mappings of the inversive plane, and Moebius transformations; projective geometry of the plane, space, and <i>n</i> dimensions; the projective generation of conics and quadrics; Moebius tetrahedra; the tetrahedral complex; the twisted cubic curve; the cubic surface; oriented circles; and introduction to algebraic geometry.In addition, three appendices deal with Euclidean definitions, postulates, and propositions; the Grassmann-Pluecker coordinates of lines in S3, and the group of circular transformations. Among the outstanding features of this book are its many worked examples and over 500 exercises to test geometrical understanding.</p><p></p><h2>Feed Zone Table: Family-Style Meals to Nourish Life and Sport (The Feed Zone Series)</h2><p><p><b>In their third cookbook, <em>Feed Zone Table</em>, chef Biju Thomas and Dr. Allen Lim offer over 100 all-new recipes to bring friends and family to the table in a way that nourishes life and sport.</b> </p><p><em>Feed Zone Table</em> will inspire your family-style dinners with a delicious line up of drinks, starters, main courses, side dishes, fresh sauces, and desserts.

And athletes aren't the only ones eating dinner alone: research shows that most people are not in the habit of consistently eating with others. Drawing from his work with professional cyclists, along with extensive research from a full line-up of scientists, sociologists, and psychologists, Dr. Lim makes the case that we are who we eat with. The simple act of eating together nourishes emotional health and in turn has a tremendous impact on how the body absorbs nutrients. In fact, for athletes this social fuel is as important as chemical fuel. It's a compelling call for athletes and nonathletes alike to return to the dinner table.</p><p>To inspire these family-style meals, Chef Biju Thomas delivers more than 100 all-new recipes.

Omer C. Stewart was one of the first anthropologists to recognize that Native Americans made significant impact across a wide range of environments. Most important, they regularly used fire to manage plant communities and associated animal species through varied and localized habitat burning. In Forgotten Fires, editors Henry T. Lewis and M. Kat Anderson present Stewart&#x2019;s original research and insights, presented in the 1950s yet still provocative today.</p><p>Significant portions of Stewart&#x2019;s text have not been available until now, and Lewis and Anderson set Stewart&#x2019;s findings in the context of current knowledge about Native hunter-gathers and their uses of fire. This volume shows that for thousands of years, the North American landscape has been regularly shaped and renewed by the land and fire management practices of North American Indians.</p></p><p><b>Omer C.

The only thing worse would be the wail of a bomb siren. I bit my lip and hurried to grab my bag.</p><p>I moved through the rooms of my grandmother&#x2019;s apartment one last time. My finger trailed over the edges of her furniture, my eyes absorbing the image of her beloved porcelains, her carved ornaments, and, lastly, the magnificent portrait of her over the mantel. The only possession of my grandmother&#x2019;s that I would take with me was hidden underneath the collar of my blouse, and feeling it against my skin gave me courage.</p><p>I learned so many things from my grandmother in the few short years I had recently come to know her. She taught me that when making a change in your life, never be sentimental and always be swift. So I took my final glances of all her precious things and reached into my satchel for the key.</p><p>As I pulled the heavy door behind me, I thrust the key in the lock. My grandmother&#x2019;s apartment and her belongings were left as she requested. The place was now sealed like a tomb.</p><p>My new life began the moment I closed the door of that apartment, as I locked my grandmother&#x2019;s secrets and personal treasures deep within.</p><p>It would become yet another buried story, in our family of reinventors and name changers, alchemists, and connoisseurs of beauty and love.</p><p>My father, a pharmacist, had grown up unaware of his true mother&#x2019;s existence until he himself was eighteen, when the soft-spoken woman who had raised him presented him a letter written in my grandmother&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&#x201c;I made a promise once,&#x201d; the woman whom he had always believed to be his mother informed him. &#x201c;And now I must tell you the truth.&#x201d;</p><p>The letter was on heavy, bonded paper, with a small gold butterfly embossed on the top. The return address read 2, Square La Bruy�re. The handwriting was flawless. A black fountain pen had rolled over the page in fluid peaks and arabesques.</p><p>My dear son, the letter began. By the time you read this, you will have turned eighteen. It&#x2019;s hard to believe that I had you so many years ago, when I was but a child myself. But it&#x2019;s important you know I exist. Do not fear, I will not demand you call me &#x201c;mother.&#x201d; Madame Franeau is the woman who will always deserve that title, and I make no apologies that I am hardly a shining example of maternal grace. But should you be curious, I am here, always available to meet you.</p><p>Her signature was large and marked with flourish. The name was wholly unfamiliar to him. Marthe de Florian.</p><p>He folded the paper, straightened his back, and made an effort to disguise his disbelief. It was almost impossible to comprehend that the woman who sat before him was not actually related to him. They both had small brown eyes, thin mouths, and dark hair. They had delicate digestions, and preferred their books and hobbies to the chore of making conversation. They found comfort in small animals, dogs, cats, and birds. And the fact that he chose to study pharmaceuticals seemed natural to all who knew him as a young boy. For he had always loved chemistry&#x2014;the glass beakers, the mixing, and the science of making things that had the capacity to heal.</p><p>Madame Franeau tried to adopt a face of stoicism as she put forth this unexpected revelation to him. Her eyes were wet and glassy as she watched him read the paper, but never once did her tears fall.</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t have children of my own,&#x201d; she finally began. He looked out the window, his face not bearing any expression, but she could see that his thoughts were far away.</p><p>&#x201c;I knew her from the first tailor shop where she worked. We were both seamstresses, and our days were colorless and bleak. We spent countless hours hemming trousers, and adjusting the lengths of sleeves. I was recently married to your father&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She stumbled over the words. The word &#x201c;father&#x201d; caught in her throat, as though after so many years of it being the truth, it was now suddenly a lie. &#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t married and had little means of support, and we were overjoyed to have a child to raise. Her only stipulation was that you learn the truth when you became of age.&#x201d; She paused and took a deep breath.</p><p>&#x201c;I will not be hurt if you want to meet her. She has since become so different than I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her voice trailed away. &#x201c;She belongs to another world. One difficult for me to explain.&#x201d;</p><p>He spent the next several days looking at the letter. He would withdraw it from his desk during breaks from studying and gaze at Marthe&#x2019;s full, scripted hand.</p><p>Only after he had finished the last of his entrance exams to the school of pharmacy did he decide to write her a reply.</p><p>His stationery was not as heavy, nor his handwriting as grand. On a simple sleeve of white paper he wrote:</p><p>Madame de Florian, I would like to visit you next Tuesday at four o&#x2019;clock. Please let me know if you might be free. As you know, I have recently learned it is a falsehood for me to use the last name &#x201c;Franeau.&#x201d; So I will close this letter with what Madame Franeau has informed me is in fact, my real last name.</p><p>Henri Beaugiron</p><p>When he called on her at her apartment, a housemaid opened the door and led him inside. The air was heavy with the fragrance of flowers, and the space was crowded with collections and curios from exotic lands. Even before she appeared, he felt ill at ease. There were just too many things. Too much velvet and satin. His childhood home had been a simple place: a bedroom with a wooden desk and bookshelves, and a living room with modest but tasteful furniture. A kitchen with a warm stove.</p><p>Now he felt as though he was entering a secret theater, one in which he clearly did not belong. Heavy drapes cascaded over the tall windows, which made it difficult to gauge whether it was night or day outside. His breathing began to escalate as he waited for her. He looked at the collections of Asian porcelains on the shelves, then the large portrait of a beautiful woman over the mantel painted with exuberant brushstrokes, and he was struck by its palette of sensual colors, its feeling of vibrancy and heat. He was about to move closer to examine it, when he became distracted by the sound of rustling silk and the striking of measured footsteps against the parquet floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Henri,&#x201d; a voice emerged. There, standing before him, was Marthe dressed in a soft pink dress, her neck roped in pearls.</p><p>They stood, several paces from each other. Her gaze was one of appraisal, as if she were looking at him as an object she may or may not choose to buy.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you look nothing as I had imagined!&#x201d; She let out a gentle laugh. &#x201c;But I suspect neither do I.&#x201d;</p><p>He was unable to reply.</p><p>If my calculations are correct, she must have been close to forty when my father first met her, though it is impossible for me to know that for sure. Even when I met Marthe years later, she claimed to be an age that would have been impossible given my father&#x2019;s age and my own. But this was certainly not the first step in her reinvention. As I would eventually learn from her, one needn&#x2019;t be born into a beautiful life in order to have one.</p><p>I met my grandmother in the last months of 1938, when I had just turned nineteen years old, a few years before everything in Europe would smolder under Hitler&#x2019;s torch. Her existence came as a complete surprise to me, like a hidden steamer trunk that was suddenly pulled down from an attic and opened to reveal a forgotten treasure.</p><p>My father spent most of his hours running his small pharmacy on Rue Jacob. Since my mother&#x2019;s death, he had struggled to find ways to occupy me, his only daughter. I had finished my schooling five months before, and now spent my days dreaming of adventures and writing down imagined stories and plays.</p><p>We were mutually frustrated with each other, and my restlessness only made it worse. At night, when he returned home from work, all he wanted was solitude, while I was eager for companionship. Our apartment was dark, the paint worn and the furniture practical. My mother&#x2019;s legacy was her books that lined the shelves. Every time I pulled a bound leather volume down from its resting place, a part of me ached, and my mourning felt like a fresh wound.</p><p>When I complained one evening about the lack of excitement in my life, he seemed to be on the brink of despair.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I can&#x2019;t be more entertaining.&#x201d; The exasperation in his voice was apparent, and it was clear he was unprepared for the trials of rearing a daughter on his own.</p><p>For a moment we sat across from each other without speaking, his eyes focusing on the tower of bookshelves before finally settling on me. At first, I thought he was thinking of my mother. The woman who had kept his house tidy, cooked his meals, and nurtured my love of books. But then, something unexpected happened.</p><p>The light in my father&#x2019;s eyes shifted. It was as though he had stumbled upon an elixir in a forgotten cabinet in his shop, and he believed this tonic might have the power to alleviate the ennui that plagued me.</p><p>&#x201c;I know someone I believe you&#x2019;ll find interesting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps she&#x2019;ll even give you some material for your writing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I haven&#x2019;t seen her in quite some time, but I will write and see if she will meet you.&#x201d;</p><p>Three days later he walked into my bedroom with a letter in his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Tomorrow, we&#x2019;ll visit someone you will not believe is actually related to me. But it&#x2019;s the truth,&#x201d; he said, as if he, too, could not quite believe the veracity of his statement.</p><p>&#x201c;And who might that be?&#x201d; I asked, perplexed.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll finally meet the woman who bore me. Marthe de Florian.&#x201d;</p><p>The next day, after our lunch, we set off for Chauss�e d&#x2019;Antin in the ninth arrondisement of Paris, where Madame de Florian&#x2019;s apartment was located. On the way, he told me he never thought of her as anything more than the woman who had given birth to him, as they had been estranged from each other most of his life.</p><p>&#x201c;The only thing we share is her original last name,&#x201d; he told me as he shook his head. &#x201c;But even that is something she&#x2019;s changed along the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And does she know about me?&#x201d; I asked him.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes . . . she knows. I took your mother to meet her before we married, and we later visited her again to announce we were expecting a child. But you will see when you meet her, Madame de Florian has little interest in marriages or births&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;What are her interests?&#x201d; I pushed him.</p><p>&#x201c;Things I find tiresome&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. her own comfort and pleasure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. her own beauty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. her belief that she is somehow above the banality of this world.&#x201d;</p><p>We had nearly reached her apartment.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s an actress of sorts, so be prepared,&#x201d; he warned. &#x201c;She enjoys an audience.&#x201d; He paused for a second and looked at me. I was dressed in my best clothes, a navy hat and wool coat, and one of my mother&#x2019;s dresses that I had taken in for the occasion.</p><p>&#x201c;She will like you very much, Solange. You&#x2019;re pretty enough to fit in amongst her things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you haven&#x2019;t seen her in so many years,&#x201d; I told my father. &#x201c;How do you know everything will still be beautiful?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I suspect that she has kept herself quite well preserved; that was very much her nature.&#x201d;</p><p>I think that upon our introduction, we both surprised each other. I know I certainly wasn&#x2019;t expecting to be greeted by a woman so elaborately dressed, with makeup camouflaging a face over sixty, and around her neck the most exquisite set of pearls.</p><p>And I believe she, too, appeared slightly amazed, for my face, although years younger than hers, so clearly resembled her own. I had the same pale skin and slate blue eyes, the long neck and Gallic nose.</p><p>My father introduced us coolly. It was evident by the way he stood in the hallway that her apartment made him nervous, and he had little tolerance for staying any length of time in her company.</p><p>He refused to call her &#x201c;mother,&#x201d; or introduce her to me as &#x201c;grand-maman..&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Madame de Florian,&#x201d; he said with great formality. &#x201c;Let me introduce you to my daughter, Solange.&#x201d;</p><p>Our arrival appeared to delight her. She didn&#x2019;t bother to reprimand my father for not having visited her in what must have been nearly twenty years. I would later learn that she didn&#x2019;t calculate time as most people did. For her it wasn&#x2019;t the minutes passed, but the moments exchanged.</p><p>&#x201c;A pleasure,&#x201d; she said to me, extending her long white hand. &#x201c;Will you both be staying? I can have Giselle prepare us some tea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be able to as I have work to do,&#x201d; my father said, making an excuse for himself. &#x201c;But Solange will, if that&#x2019;s acceptable.&#x201d; He looked at me, then back at this tall woman who seemed wholly unrelated to him. &#x201c;Since her mother died, she has been restless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She just finished school and tells me she wants to write plays, perhaps even try her hand at a novel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So I thought perhaps you might share some stories with her while I am at the pharmacy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But, of course, Henri,&#x201d; she said, reaching to touch my arm. &#x201c;I am not so busy anymore, and I would appreciate having the company of a beautiful girl to share my afternoons.&#x201d;</p><p>I stood there, rapt at her. Her voice was melodious. Her eyes were full of life.</p><p>&#x201c;Giselle, take her hat and coat.&#x201d; My wool coat and felt hat were given to the elderly maid in the black dress and white apron.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick her up at six,&#x201d; my father said.</p><p>With that he left us, and I was led inside.</p><p>I will never forget the parlor, with the large portrait that dominated the room. It was undoubtedly of her, created in a tornado of brushstrokes. Around her neck, the same necklace she now wore, a glimmering, perfect set of pearls.</p><p>She saw me look at the painting, and then the choker around her neck.</p><p>&#x201c;I have never seen so many beautiful things,&#x201d; I whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;Why, thank you,&#x201d; she retorted, ever so pleased. She then took a seat in one of the velvet chairs, as though it were her personal throne.</p><p>I believe she could sense my desire to study everything that surrounded us in the parlor, even though I tried hard to control my urge to stare. The collections of porcelain. The many objets d&#x2019;art. The painting over the mantel. Even her string of pearls.</p><p>I admitted to be most taken in by the painting. I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off it.</p><p>&#x201c;Who was the artist?&#x201d; I asked, pointing to her portrait. The body, depicted with great, artistic exuberance, seemed to give off a pulse within the room.</p><p>&#x201c;The artist?&#x201d; She was bemused. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the artist you should be asking about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No?&#x201d; I answered, perplexed.</p><p>She motioned for me to sit down.</p><p>Her eyes flickered and she reached to touch her necklace. Its clasp, a small green butterfly with emerald wings, slid forth.</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s the story behind it. Everything of value contains a story, Solange.&#x201d;</p><p>She touched the butterfly with a light caress of her fingers. I had never been in the company of someone who could so cap...</p></p><h2>Anthroposophy in Everyday Life: Practical Training in Thought - Overcoming Nervousness - Facing Karma - The Four Temperaments</h2><p>Four of Rudolf Steiner's best-loved lectures are collected in this book. They are some of the most accessible presentations of the anthroposophic approach to life available in English. Included are: <ul> <li> Practical Training in Thought </li><li> Overcoming Nervousness </li><li> Facing Karma </li><li> The Four Temperaments </li></ul> The first lecture concerns the fundamental human activity of thinking. Everything we do, we do through thinking. The first task, then, is to realize the reality of thinking. To help us do this, Steiner gives exercises that will allow us to experience the cognitive, even clairvoyant, power of thinking. <br><br> In "Overcoming Nervousness," Steiner shows us how exercises in thinking also give us the calm centered sense needed to lead purposeful, healthy lives. <br><br> "Facing Karma" takes us to the heart of life, where we experience suffering and happiness. The law of karma that determines life's experiences and encounters also helps us develop the self-knowledge required for self-transformation. <br><br> Finally, "The Four Temperaments" show us how the union of hereditary factors and our own inner spiritual nature shape our psychology. The guide here is the ancient classifications of sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic. Renewed understanding of these allows us to develop a truly modern spiritual psychology, which is the basis of all real inner development. <br><br> With its many practical exercises, mantras, and meditations, this book is a fundamental introduction for anyone beginning or needing encouragement along the path of inner development.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>What Darkness Brings (Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery)</h2><p><b>In this mystery in the Sebastian St. Cyr series, the aristocratic investigator is drawn into a sordid world of greed, desperation, and the occult when the husband of his former lover is accused of murder.&nbsp;</b><br><br><i>Regency England, September 1812</i>: After a long night spent dealing with the tragic death of a former military comrade, a heart-sick Sebastian learns of a new calamity: Russell Yates, the dashing, one-time privateer who married Kat Boleyn a year ago, has been found standing over the corpse of Benjamin Eisler, a wealthy gem dealer. Yates insists he is innocent, but he will surely hang unless Sebastian can unmask the real killer.<br><br>For the sake of Kat, the woman he once loved and lost, Sebastian plunges into a treacherous circle of intrigue. Although Eisler&#x2019;s clients included the Prince Regent and the Emperor Napoleon, he was a despicable man with many enemies and a number of dangerous, well-kept secrets&#x2014;including a passion for arcane texts and black magic. Central to the case is a magnificent blue diamond, believed to have once formed part of the French crown jewels, which disappeared on the night of Eisler&#x2019;s death. As Sebastian traces the diamond&#x2019;s ownership, he uncovers links that implicate an eccentric, powerful financier named Hope and stretch back into the darkest days of the French Revolution.<br><br>When the killer grows ever more desperate and vicious, Sebastian finds his new marriage to Hero tested by the shadows of his first love, especially when he begins to suspect that Kat is keeping secrets of her own. And as matters rise to a crisis, Sebastian must face a bitter truth&#x2014;that he has been less than open with the fearless woman who is now his wife.</p><p><b>C.S. Harris</b> has written more than a twenty novels, including the Sebastian St. Cyr mystery series; the C.S. Graham thriller series, co-authored with former intelligence officer Steven Harris; and seven award-winning historical romances written under the name Candice Proctor. A respected scholar of nineteenth century Europe, she is also the author of a nonfiction historical study of the French Revolution. She lives in New Orleans with her husband and two daughters.Eighth in Harris&#x2019; Sebastian St. Cyr series, this volume is perhaps the best yet, with its air of Regency intrigue and its abashed, somewhat bewildered hero. The story begins with newly married Sebastian, still grieving after the death of a friend, caught up in the murder of a wicked gem dealer whose demise is blamed on St. Cyr&#x2019;s acquaintance Russell Yates, now languishing in prison. Found bloodied and standing over the corpse, Yates needs Sebastian&#x2019;s sleuthing expertise, though it&#x2019;s Yates&#x2019; wife, Kat Boleyn, St. Cyr&#x2019;s former lover, who begs for help. It&#x2019;s a delicious, complicated tangle made even tastier by Sebastian&#x2019;s bride, the wise Hero, and by Harris&#x2019; tender treatment of the newlyweds&#x2019; affection and growing love for one another. Harris&#x2019; acute characterizations and her facility for portraying the complexities of human emotion are similar to Imogen Robertson&#x2019;s in Anatomy of Murder(2012), while her view of social niceties hiding dark motives conjures Anne Perry. --Jen Baker</p><h2>The Art of Fiction: Illustrated from Classic and Modern Texts</h2><p>The articles with which David Lodge entertained and enlightened readers of the <b>Independent on Sunday</b> and <b>The Washington Post</b> are now revised, expanded and collected together in book form.<p>The art of fiction is considered under a wide range of headings, such as the Intrusive Author, Suspense, the Epistolary Novel, Time-shift, Magical Realism and Symbolism, and each topic is illustrated by a passage or two taken from classic or modern fiction. Drawing on writers as diverse as Henry James and Martin Amis, Jane Austen and Fay Weldon and Henry Fielding and James Joyce, David Lodge makes accessible to the general reader the richness and variety of British and American fiction. Technical terms, such as Interior Monologue, Metafiction, Intertextuality and the Unreliable Narrator, are lucidly explained and their application demonstrated.</p><p>Bringing to criticism the verve and humour of his own novels, David Lodge has provided essential reading for students of literature, aspirant writers, and anyone who wishes to understand how literature works.</p><p></p></p><p>David Lodge is the author of twelve novels and a novella, including the Booker Prize finalists <b>Small World</b> and <b>Nice Work</b>. He is also the author of many works of literary criticism, including <b>The Art of Fiction</b> and <b>Consciousness and the Novel</b>.British novelist Lodge ( Paradise News ) retired in 1987 from Birmingham University's English faculty and swore off academic prose, but in 1991 he consented to contribute a series of columns "of interest to a more general reading public" to the London Independent . Each of these 50 essays begins with a brief fiction passage, addressed and interpreted topically by Lodge, who discusses point of view, the unreliable narrator, "the uncanny," "weather" and other aspects of writing. For example, in Chapter 19, "Repetition," he observes that while Hemingway is famous for the "charged simplicity" of his reiterated words or phrases, repetition brings a special flavor to the work of writers as various as Dickens, Lawrence and Martin Amis--and he proves it. The selections are varied, although perhaps slanted to favor gentility (Austen and Nabokov, not Meredith or Dreiser), and tend to verify the opinion that "the novel has always been centrally concerned with erotic attraction and desire." Lodge may be working a bit below full capacity here, but apart from serving as a genial companion, he defines terms of the novelist's craft so deftly and concisely that this pleasurable browse could rescue (or replace) many a college syllabus. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Deck of Spells: Hoodoo Playing Card Magic in Rootwork and Conjure</h2><p>Playing cards have a rich and mysterious history that is now revealed to you!

Alexi's babushka was telling him what Christmas was like when she was a girl - before the soldiers came. "Our church was as crowded as a pod full of peas. Candles made the church as bright as the sunniest day. Watching over us was the blessed icon of St. Nicholas." Alexi had many questions, including, "Why can't we celebrate Christmas tomorrow in St. Nicholas?" Babushka sadly replied that it would take a miracle after sixty years. Well, Alexi had heard enough. If there truly was such a thing as a miracle, why couldn't one happen here? And so unfolds a story which poignantly reveals how, though quiet and hidden, faith and hope can not be suppressed - by soldiers or by time. Beautifully illustrated with original four-color paintings on every page. A perfect Christmas present.</p></p><p></p><h2>Whiter Than Snow: Meditations on Sin and Mercy</h2><p><p>What do you do when you've really blown it? Is sin really as dangerous and is grace really as powerful as the Bible says they are? Is there such a thing as a new beginning?</p><p>Sin and grace-these are the two themes of our lives. We all blow it and we all need to start over again. In Psalm 51, David tells his story of moral failure, personal awareness, grief, confession, repentance, commitment, and hope. And because David's story is every believer's story, Psalm 51 is every believer's psalm. It tells how we, as broken sinners, can be brutally honest with God and yet stand before him without fear.</p><p>Whiter Than Snow unpacks this powerful little psalm in fifty-two meditations, reminding readers that by God's grace there is mercy for every wrong and grace for every new beginning. Designed for busy believers, these brief and engaging meditations are made practical by the reflection questions that conclude each chapter.</p></p><p><p><strong>Paul David Tripp</strong> (DMin, Westminster Theological Seminary) is a pastor, author, and international conference speaker.

The structure is most similar to <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, with <i>The Bone Clocks</i> pivoting around a central character: Holly Sykes. Each chapter/novella is narrated from the perspective of an intersecting character, with settings ranging from England in the 80s to the apocalyptic future. Each story could stand alone as a work of genius, as they slowly build on Holly&#x2019;s unwitting role in a war between two groups with psychic powers, culminating in a thrilling showdown reminiscent of the best of Stephen King.

She lives in Spring, Texas, where she's at work on her next novel.</p>Chapter One <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Kylie Galen looked up from the slice of pepperoni pizza on the fine china plate and tried to ignore the ghost swinging the bloody sword right behind her grandfather and great-aunt. Her newfound family members were&nbsp;&#x2026; good people, but a tad on the proper side. And proper people probably wouldn&#x2019;t appreciate an uninvited ghost getting their dining room walls bloody. <br>The spirit, a female, dark flowing hair, in her early thirties, stopped in mid-swing and stared directly at Kylie. <i>You kill or be killed. It&#x2019;s really rather simple.</i> The words reverberated in Kylie&#x2019;s head. They were communicating telepathically, and considering the topic being discussed, that was probably for the best. <br> <i>That&#x2019;s not simple,</i> Kylie shot back. <i>And I&#x2019;m trying to eat, so would you mind leaving?</i> <br> <i>That&#x2019;s rude,</i> the ghost said. <i>You&#x2019;re supposed to help spirits. You need to abide by your guidelines.</i> <br>Kylie twisted the cloth napkin she&#x2019;d placed in her lap. Okay, was there something written in the rule books about a ghost whisperer having to be polite to obnoxious spirits? <br>Oh, wait, she didn&#x2019;t have a freaking rule book, or guidelines. She was winging it. Winging everything, in fact: ghost whispering, being a supernatural, being someone&#x2019;s girlfriend. <br> <i>Being someone&#x2019;s ex-girlfriend!</i> <br>Lately it felt like she was winging her whole damned life, and making a fine mess of things, too. Like her decision to leave Shadow Falls, the camp/recently turned boarding school for paranormal teens. It had felt like the right thing to do at the time. <br> <i>Had.</i> <br>She&#x2019;d been here at the chameleons&#x2019; compound less than two weeks, and she wasn&#x2019;t so sure anymore. <br>True, she&#x2019;d had a good reason to come&#x2014;to discover more about her paranormal heritage. To get to know Malcolm Summers, her grandfather, and her great-aunt Francyne. <br>Months after learning she wasn&#x2019;t all human, she&#x2019;d finally discovered she was a chameleon, a rare species that had gone into hiding after an organized unit of the paranormal government, the Fallen Research Unit, the FRU, had used them as lab rats to try to explain their abilities. Kylie&#x2019;s own grandmother had died as a result. And now the same branch of the FRU wanted to take Kylie in for testing. That was so not happening! <br>However, Kylie&#x2019;s main motivation for leaving Shadow Falls didn&#x2019;t have anything to do with the FRU, or with finding out about her heritage. Nope. It had everything to do with running away. <br>Running away from Lucas, the werewolf she&#x2019;d fallen in love with. The werewolf who had promised his soul to another werewolf and expected Kylie to believe it meant nothing. How could he have done that? How could he have kissed Kylie with all that passion for the last month, yet every time he went to his dad&#x2019;s house, he was seeing that girl? How could Kylie stay at Shadow Falls and continue to face him? <br>The problem was, she might have run away from Lucas, but she&#x2019;d brought the heartbreak with her. And now, she wasn&#x2019;t just hurting over a certain werewolf; she was hurting because&nbsp;&#x2026; every cell in her body missed Shadow Falls. Okay, so maybe not really Shadow Falls, but she missed the people. Friends who had become as close as family: Holiday, the fae camp leader, who was like a big sister. Burnett, the stern vampire, the other camp leader who was a friend and sort of a father figure wrapped into one. Her two roommates, Della and Miranda, who&#x2019;d felt abandoned by Kylie when she left. And Derek, who&#x2019;d vowed his love to her, even when he knew she loved Lucas. <br>Oh God, she missed everyone so much. Amazingly, she was only a few miles away from Shadow Falls, tucked away in a secluded spot in what Texans referred to as the hill country, and yet it might as well have been across the world. <br>Sure, she&#x2019;d spoken to Holiday every day. At first, her grandfather had refused her this right, but her aunt had insisted he see reason. He&#x2019;d relented, but only if she used a certain phone and kept the conversations very short, so the calls couldn&#x2019;t be traced. And by no means could Kylie tell anyone where she was. <br>Because of the camp&#x2019;s affiliation with the FRU, her grandfather didn&#x2019;t trust anyone at Shadow Falls. And his distrust only added to Kylie&#x2019;s feelings of isolation from everyone she loved. Even her mom, who called to inform her that she was about to fly to England with John, her mom&#x2019;s new boyfriend, whom Kylie wasn&#x2019;t so sweet on. Sure, her granddad allowed her to call her mom back every time she called. So they had spoken twice. But only twice. <br>Kylie&#x2019;s throat knotted with tears, but she refused to cry. She had to be strong. Pull up her big-girl panties and be an adult. <br>&#x201c;Is the pizza to your liking?&#x201d; Francyne, her great-aunt, asked. <br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s great.&#x201d; Kylie watched the two older people slice into their piece of pepperoni pizza as if it were steak. She knew they served it just for her&#x2014;because after barely touching her meals these last few days, they&#x2019;d asked about her favorite foods. Feeling obligated, both to eat and to comply with their show of manners, she forced herself to cut a bite of pizza from her slice and slip it into her mouth. <br>She wasn&#x2019;t vampire right now, so she should be able to enjoy food. But nope. <br>Nothing tasted right. <br>Nothing felt right. <br>Not eating pizza with a fork off a fine china plate that looked old and rare enough to be in a museum. Not sitting at this fancy dining table with a formal place setting. And especially not feeling right was the spirit who now moved in closer to her grandfather and held the sword over his head. <br>Kylie stared at the spirit. <i>Either tell me exactly what you need, that doesn&#x2019;t involve murder, or go away.</i> <br>A drop of blood splattered onto her grandfather&#x2019;s forehead. Not that he could feel it or see it. But Kylie could. The spirit performed this show just to get Kylie&#x2019;s attention. <br>And it was working. <br> <i>Stop it! Leave</i>. Kylie shot a warning glance at the spirit. <br> <i>You are in a nasty mood, huh?</i> the ghost said. <br>Yeah, she was, Kylie admitted to herself. A broken heart would do that to you. It pretty much sucked the joy out of life. Or maybe what sucked the most was missing everyone. <br>Not that Kylie&#x2019;s time here had been in vain. She&#x2019;d discovered a lot about herself, about chameleons, these thirteen days. Chameleons had only come into being in the last hundred years. While they considered themselves a species, they were really a blend of all paranormals&#x2014;individuals who retained the DNA and powers of all the species. <br>Problem was, learning to control that power was a real bitch. Most chameleons didn&#x2019;t even master the feat until their mid-twenties. Not that there were a lot of young chameleons trying to master things. Chameleons were rare. Her grandfather said about a hundred compounds existed across the world, but in total there were less than ten thousand of her kind. And only one in ten chameleon couples had been able to produce a child. Hence the low population. <br>Kylie couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder if she&#x2019;d ever be able to have a child. But damn, she was sixteen, too young to start worrying about being infertile. <br>&#x201c;How did classes go today?&#x201d; her grandfather asked. <br>Kylie focused on the man. In his seventies, his hair held tight to its strawberry blond color, with only a few signs of graying. His eyes, a vivid light blue, matched hers and her father&#x2019;s. <br>Another drop of blood landed on his cheek. Kylie scowled at the smirking spirit who sliced the sword though the air only an inch above his head. <br> <i>I said, stop it!</i> Kylie tightened her eyes. <br>&#x201c;So it didn&#x2019;t go well?&#x201d; her grandfather asked, obviously reading Kylie&#x2019;s expression. <br>&#x201c;No, it went fine. I&#x2019;m&nbsp;&#x2026; I was able to switch my pattern from a werewolf to a fae.&#x201d; Supernaturals all had patterns that could be seen by other supernaturals. Chameleons had their own pattern, one they hid. And unlike any other supernatural they could change into any other species, and attain this species&#x2019; powers with the transformation. <br>Problem was, like their other powers, it wasn&#x2019;t easy to control. Classes here didn&#x2019;t involve so much English, math, and science, but training on how to control one&#x2019;s powers and to hide their true pattern from the world. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s amazing. Then why the long face?&#x201d; her grandfather asked. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&#x2026;&#x201d; <i>I&#x2019;m miserable here. I want to go back to Shadow Falls</i>. The words sat on the tip of her tongue, but she couldn&#x2019;t say them. Not until she knew for sure that she&#x2019;d given this a shot. And until she knew how she would survive facing Lucas. <br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t frowning at you. It&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Kylie has company,&#x201d; Francyne said. Her aunt wasn&#x2019;t a full-fledged ghost whisperer. She claimed she couldn&#x2019;t see them or hear them, but she could pick up on a spirit&#x2019;s presence easily. <br>The ghost held the sword up, pointing it at the ceiling as if making some big declaration. <i>You&#x2019;re about to have more company.</i> <br>Kylie didn&#x2019;t know what that was supposed to mean, but she focused on her confused-looking grandfather now and not the spirit. <br>&#x201c;Company?&#x201d; Her grandfather looked at his sister-in-law. &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; He tensed. Then his eyes widened. &#x201c;Is it my wife, or my son, Daniel?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Kylie wished Daniel, her father, who&#x2019;d died before she was born, would come for a visit. She could use some TLC, and her father was really good at offering it. However, he&#x2019;d used all his allotted time on earth. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not them. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; someone else,&#x201d; Kylie answered. <br>Someone who had yet to explain what she wanted or needed. Well, except to tell Kylie she needed her to kill someone. What did the spirit think Kylie was? A killer for hire? <br>The spirit leaned down close to her grandfather&#x2019;s ear. <i>It&#x2019;s a shame you can&#x2019;t see me. You&#x2019;re kind of cute.</i> She proceeded to lick the blood from his cheek. Slowly. And she looked at Kylie when she did it. <br>Kylie dropped her fork. &#x201c;Stop licking my grandfather, right now!&#x201d; <br>The spirit brought her tongue back into her mouth and stared at Kylie. <i>Stop fighting your fate. Accept what you must do. Let me teach you how you must kill him.</i> <br>&#x201c;Kill who?&#x201d; Kylie blurted out, and then flinched when she realized she&#x2019;d been speaking aloud. <br>&#x201c;Lick? Kill? What?&#x201d; her grandfather asked. <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Kylie insisted. &#x201c;I was talking&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She was talking to the spirit, I think,&#x201d; her aunt said, her brows pinched in worry. <br>&#x201c;About killing someone?&#x201d; her grandfather asked, and shot Kylie a direct look. <br>When Kylie didn&#x2019;t answer, Malcolm glanced around the room as if nervous. His expression of fear reminded her so much of the other supernaturals at Shadow Falls. <br>That&#x2019;s when a thought hit. She&#x2019;d come here thinking she&#x2019;d fit in, and yet, even living on a compound of about fifty acres in Texas hill country, with about twenty-five other chameleons, she still didn&#x2019;t fit in. And it wasn&#x2019;t just the ghost whispering, but the fact that she was so much further advanced than the four other teens here. And they weren&#x2019;t overly thrilled to be shown up by the newbie, either. <br>The elders of the group&#x2014;which included her grandfather and great-aunt and about four others&#x2014;guessed that Kylie&#x2019;s early development was because she was also a protector, a supernatural with amazing strength. While that sounded pretty cool, she would argue with that definition for so many reasons. <br>Topping those reasons was that she could only use those powers to protect others, and never herself. Which to Kylie didn&#x2019;t make a lick of sense. If she was in charge of protecting others, wasn&#x2019;t it important that she kind of stay alive? Who the heck had made that rule? <br>Kylie sighed, a sigh that felt as sorrowful on the inside as it sounded leaving her lips. Was it simply her destiny to always be a misfit? <br>Her grandfather leaned forward and set his silver fork and knife beside the expensive piece of china. &#x201c;Kylie, I hate to intrude with your&nbsp;&#x2026; spirit matters, but why would a spirit be conversing with you about killing someone?&#x201d; <br>Kylie bit down on her lip and tried to find a way to explain without completely freaking them out. Especially when it freaked her out. She opened her mouth to say something, but was saved by a bell. A very loud bell, more like a siren. The lights in the chandelier over the table started flickering. <br>Her grandfather, his frown deepening, pulled out a cell phone from his perfectly pressed white dress shirt, punched one button, and held it to his ear. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Who?&#x201d; he snapped, and cut his eyes to Kylie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right there!&#x201d; <br>He turned the phone off and shot up from his chair, and then faced his sister-in-law. &#x201c;You and Kylie disappear. Hide out in the barn. I&#x2019;ll be there shortly.&#x201d; <br>By disappear, Kylie surmised he meant vanish, another thing a chameleon could do. Vanish. Like into thin air. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Kylie asked, remembering the ghost saying she was about to get company. <br>&#x201c;We have intruders.&#x201d; His deep, matter-of-fact tone sounded deeper, more serious. <br>&#x201c;Intruders?&#x201d; Kylie asked. <br>His eyes tightened. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the FRU! Now vanish.&#x201d; <br>Her aunt came around the table and reached for Kylie&#x2019;s hand. Then the woman vanished, and in a fraction of a second, Kylie looked down and her own legs had disappeared. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Christie Craig <br></p><h2>The Chrysalids (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><i>The Chyrsalids </i>is set in the future after a devastating global nuclear war. David, the young hero of the novel, lives in a tight-knit community of religious and genetic fundamentalists, always on the alert for any deviation from the norm of God&#x2019;s creation. Abnormal plants are publicly burned, with much singing of hymns. Abnormal humans (who are not really human) are also condemned to destruction&#x2014;unless they succeed in fleeing to the Fringes, that Wild Country where, as the authorities say, nothing is reliable and the devil does his work. David grows up ringed by admonitions: KEEP PURE THE STOCK OF THE LORD; WATCH THOU FOR THE MUTANT.<br><br>At first he does not question.

In 1924 he turned to writing, and within a number of years he was selling short stories, mostly science fiction, to pulp magazines in America, as John Beynon or John Beynon Harris. During World War II, he served behind the lines in the British army, and in 1951 he published <i>The Day of the Triffids</i>, his first novel as John Wyndham, and a tremendous success.

It edits our thoughts, controls our behavior, and inhibits our actions. It thinks it is protecting us from being hurt or feeling abandoned, but all it really does is reinforce our feelings of shame and guilt, sabotage our intimate relationships, and incline us to self-destructive behaviors. <em>Conquer Your Critical Inner Voice</em> presents a revolutionary new strategy for dealing with the inner critic: externalizing it. This subtle, powerful technique turns internal self-criticisms into 'you' statements that can be evaluated objectively and exposed as the gross exaggerations, unfair comparisons, or flat out lies they really are. This book takes you through the step-by-step process of learning how to keep track of your negative thoughts, analyze their reality, and recognize how they impact your life. Learn to use a variety of techniques to help release your inner critic's stranglehold and combat its subversive effect on your career achievement, intimate relationships, and sexuality. A final chapter of the book offers parents simple ways to help their children avoid forming a tyrannical inner critic.</p></p><p><b>Robert W.

Wielding a confident knife, she diligently pared and sorted Provence&#x2019;s springtime treasures&#x2014;�baby carrots, peas and artichokes so tender they could be served raw, topped by thinly sliced lemons sweet enough to eat with their rinds on.&nbsp;<br><br>She was working briskly and a delicate sheen of sweat made her sensitive to that sudden change in the wind as it rustled significantly through the pine tree&#x2019;s branches. Because Ondine had been raised to believe in nature&#x2019;s auspicious signs and warnings, she put down her knife, closed her eyes and lifted her head to greet the breeze as it skimmed across her face with an invigorating whiff of the sea.&nbsp;<br><br>She seldom got a quiet moment alone like this to think her own thoughts. So when a hazy premonition of a more exciting future somewhere far away began to shape itself in her mind, she struggled to capture it, as if reaching to grasp a firefly before the light disappeared.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Ondine!&#x201d; her mother shouted from the caf�&#x2019;s kitchen. &#x201c;Where is she? On-�dine!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine flinched as she heard her name reverberating against the huddle of pale stone buildings. She glanced up, and saw her mother&#x2019;s head framed by the window like a portrait of a formidable empress. Even though it was too late for breakfast and too early for the lunch service, there was never a lull in cooking chores to do in order to meet the caf�&#x2019;s high standards.&nbsp;<br><br>Everyone who worked in the Caf� Paradis knew his role, right down to the striped cat who patrolled for any mouse foolhardy enough to come near the kitchen, and the bulldog who stood guard against tramps skulking about for an easy handout or an unlocked window. As for Ondine, who was seventeen now, her job was to do whatever her mother told her.&nbsp;<br><br>Madame Belange peered out the kitchen window and finally spied her daughter. &#x201c;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing, lounging there in the garden like a pasha?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just finishing up, Maman!&#x201d; Ondine called, rising hastily and hoisting her vegetable basket on her hip as she hurried to the kitchen. By now the fortuitous wind had gone off on its inscrutable way without her. In its place came the usual busy odors of kitchen oil and truck fuel and wood-�burning from the farmers&#x2019; fields. Still, there was definitely a whiff of something special in the air today&#x2014;�her parents had been acting oddly all morning, murmuring to each other in hushed tones.&nbsp;<br><br>As she drew closer to the open kitchen window, Ondine&#x2019;s discerning nose picked up the first scents of the day&#x2019;s luncheon menu: onion-�and-�black-�olive tartes called pissaladi�re; a pork stew of red wine and myrtle; and, for the fish&#x2014;�could it be . . . ?&nbsp;<br><br>She burst inside and went straight to the old black stove seething in its corner with the collected heat of decades of well-�cooked meals. The fragrance wafting from a big kettle was unmistakable now.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Bouillabaisse!&#x201d; she exclaimed, wondering why her mother had chosen this special dish&#x2014;�which required a half-�dozen kinds of fish&#x2014;�instead of making a simpler and less expensive fish soup called bourride. Ondine lifted the pot&#x2019;s lid and inhaled rapturously. Celery, onion, garlic, tomato, fennel, pepper, parsley, thyme, bay and the distinctive orange rind used in the South of France; and something else especially rare and precious, which turned the broth to the color of gold.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you use P�re Jacques&#x2019; saffron today?&#x201d; Ondine asked, impressed.&nbsp;<br><br>Her busy mother glanced up and actually paused for a moment. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Madame Belange said, reaching for a tiny glass vial which she held up to the light and examined reverently. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s the last of it, all except this one strand which I could not bear to lose.&#x201d; Mother and daughter exchanged a look of awe as they gazed at the red thread of saffron, which imparted a mysterious taste that the old monk P�re Jacques described as a kiss between fresh-�mown hay and chestnut honey.&nbsp;<br><br>P�re Jacques had given this homegrown saffron to Ondine when she graduated from a convent boarding school in the hills above Nice. The meditative old monk who ran the abbey&#x2019;s kitchen was one of those rare elders that appreciated Ondine&#x2019;s curiosity instead of being irritated by it. Knowing that her family ran a caf�, he&#x2019;d allowed her to escape the usual convent chores to assist him in his calm, contemplative gardens, learning his ancient secrets of cuisine.&nbsp;<br><br>There is nothing on earth like French saffron, he&#x2019;d said proudly, showing her his field of mauve-�colored crocuses which he patiently tended until two rare days in October when they bloomed. Then, all the monks pitched in to pluck the delicate red pistils&#x2014;�only three per flower&#x2014;�which, when carefully dried, became those prized red threads that P�re Jacques put into glass vials. Ondine and her mother doled out these strands of saffron to make them last, using them only for special occasions, like Christmas custards and macarons.<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on today?&#x201d; Ondine asked, intrigued.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;We have an important new customer for lunch,&#x201d; her mother answered distractedly.&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine dipped a spoon to taste the bouillabaisse. &#x201c;Mmm. Wonderful! But, it could use more pepper,&#x201d; she suggested.<br><br>Madame Belange shook her head and said crisply, &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s fine as it is. I&#x2019;d rather err on the side of caution today.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine felt a wave of sympathy for her mother, who, unlike P�re Jacques, functioned as if on a knife&#x2019;s-�edge, her nerves taut as she constantly battled against time, supplies and cost, with scarcely a franc or a moment to spare. But despite her request for help, Madame Belange kept nudging her daughter out of the way impatiently, as if it were obvious that this small, cramped kitchen didn&#x2019;t really have room for two grown women.&nbsp;<br><br>Raising a flour-�dusted wrist to push aside a stray lock of hair, Madame Belange said, &#x201c;Vite, vite, get to work!&#x201d; But then she cried out warningly, &#x201c;Attention!&#x201d; as the back door was flung open by a local dairy boy who barreled in with a large crate of eggs, cheese and cream. Ondine ducked out of the way just in time.&nbsp;<br><br>While her mother paid the boy, Ondine unpacked his crate onto an enormous table in the center of the room. She&#x2019;d been awake since dawn, first to make hot chocolate for the quick breakfast she shared with her parents, then to serve the morning customers their brioche and coffee. After that, she got the stocks simmering gently on the stove before she went outside to pare her vegetables; now it was time to assemble all the salads for the lunch service.<br><br>Yet apparently her mother had much more unusual plans for Ondine today.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Just make one perfect salad, fit for our new Patron,&#x201d; Madame Belange commanded. &#x201c;And write down every ingredient we&#x2019;ve used in today&#x2019;s lunch for our records.&#x201d; With her hip she pushed a cupboard drawer shut. &#x201c;This man will be a regular customer, so we don&#x2019;t want to give him the same lunches again and again. Make notes, tout de suite&#x2014;�and put that convent schooling of yours to some real use!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine reached up to a shelf for one of the blank notebooks they used for such occasions&#x2014;�bound in butter-�soft maroon leather, they&#x2019;d been a gift from a stationer who ate his lunch at the caf� three times a week. She turned to the first page, which had a printed box framed by an illustration of bunched grapes on a twirling vine. Inside the box was a line designated for filling in a Nom. She imagined that this new Patron must be some rich banker or lawyer.&nbsp;<br><br>She paused. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his name?&#x201d; she asked curiously.<br><br>Her mother waved a ladle indifferently. &#x201c;Who knows? He&#x2019;s got money, that&#x2019;s all that matters!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>So Ondine simply wrote a large P for Patron. Then she turned to the next page and wrote 2 April 1936 at the top before she recorded today&#x2019;s meal, checking on which ingredients were used and how they were cooked. Her mother kept such records only for distinguished customers, and special events like catered meals or wedding banquets. Later she would add comments about the Patron&#x2019;s personal preferences and how the recipe might be better tailored to him.&nbsp;<br><br>Madame Belange looked up from the stove and said resolutely, &#x201c;All right now. Put away the notebook and let&#x2019;s pack up this meal!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Pack it?&#x201d; Ondine echoed in surprise.&nbsp;<br><br>Her mother wore an especially sober expression. &#x201c;This man has rented one of the villas at the top of the hill. Here&#x2019;s the address,&#x201d; she said, digging in her pocket for a scrap of paper and handing it to her. &#x201c;You will use your bicycle to bring him his lunch every weekday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What am I, a donkey?&#x201d; Ondine demanded indignantly. &#x201c;Since when do we deliver lunch to people&#x2019;s houses? Who is this man, that he can&#x2019;t come to the caf� to eat his lunch like everybody else?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Madame Belange said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s someone tr�s c�l�bre from Paris. He speaks French, but I&#x2019;m told he&#x2019;s a Spaniard. The nuns taught you Spanish at the convent, yes?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;A little,&#x201d; Ondine answered warily.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it might finally come in handy.&#x201d; Her mother glanced around decisively. &#x201c;Get me that nice striped pitcher for the wine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s your favorite!&#x201d; Ondine objected. Besides, the tall, hand-�painted pink-�and-�blue pitcher had been promised to her for her wedding trousseau&#x2014;�if she ever made it to the altar. Her unsentimental mother shrugged. Ondine muttered, &#x201c;I hope this fancy Spaniard appreciates it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>She had to move swiftly now; the meal was coming together quickly. They packed the lunch into an insulated metal hamper, wrapping each dish tightly in red-�and-�white cloths. Then Ondine went into the basement to an oaken barrel of house wine, from which she siphoned off enough white wine to fill a bladder made of pigskin which she brought upstairs. Madame Belange ordered one of the waiters to carry the hamper outside and securely clip it to the metal basket on Ondine&#x2019;s bicycle.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Alors! Listen carefully.&#x201d; Her mother fixed her with a stern look. &#x201c;You are to enter the Patron&#x2019;s house from the side door, which he will leave unlocked for you. Go straight into the kitchen. Heat up the food and lay it out for him. Then leave, right away. Do not wait for him to come downstairs to eat.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Madame Belange pinched her daughter on the arm. &#x201c;Do you hear me, Ondine?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; Ondine protested. She&#x2019;d been listening attentively and felt she didn&#x2019;t deserve that. But her exhausted mother sometimes just ran out of words, and punctuated the urgency of her commands with a quick slap if anyone in her kitchen asked too many questions. Madame Belange, in her own youth, had never witnessed mothers and daughters having the luxury of time to indulge in searching, philosophical chats. Children were like baby chicks whom one loved the way a mother hen did&#x2014;�you fed them, kept them warm, taught them how to fend for themselves, and pecked them with a nudge in the right direction whenever they wandered astray.<br><br>Madame Belange repeated, &#x201c;Go in quietly, prepare the food, lay it out, and leave. Do not call out to him or make noise. Later, you&#x2019;ll go collect the dishes, without making a sound.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine had a terrible urge to burst out laughing at these absurd orders to skulk around like a thief. But her mother was so very serious that Ondine recognized the weight of her responsibility.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I understand, Maman,&#x201d; she said, although her curiosity was thoroughly piqued now.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Take the daffodils from the dining room with you. Afterwards, on your way home, stop by the market to buy new flowers for the caf�,&#x201d; her mother said in a low voice, digging into her apron pocket for a few coins. &#x201c;Here.&#x201d; Then, with her elbow, she gave her daughter a shove. &#x201c;Go!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Ondine dutifully went through the swinging doors that led to the formal dining room, which was reserved for the night meal only. Breakfast and lunch were always served outside on the front terrace, rain or shine, since there was a sturdy white-�and-�grey awning that could be cranked overhead and withstood most bad weather.<br><br>The Caf� Paradis occupied the first floor of a limestone house that was the color of a honey praline. Ondine&#x2019;s family lived in the rooms above the caf�. The second floor had a master bedroom for her parents, and a smaller bedroom for occasional overnight lodgers. Her two older brothers once occupied that guest room, but both were killed in the Great War and now slumbered in the town cemetery, near their infant siblings who&#x2019;d been lost to scarlet fever before Ondine was born. The third and topmost floor had only one slope-�roofed room, originally made for servants, where Ondine had slept all her life.&nbsp; <br>1&nbsp;Ondine at the Caf� Paradis, Spring 1936&nbsp;A salty southwestern wind came rushing across the Mediterranean Sea with heraldic ceremony, driving a white-�capped tide against the rocks and jostling the fishing boats in the harbor of Juan-�les-�Pins before sweeping into the backyard of the Caf� Paradis, where Ondine was busy peeling her vegetables.&nbsp;She&#x2019;d escaped outdoors with her work on this sunny April morning because the caf�&#x2019;s kitchen was already a cauldron.

He lives in Washington, D.C., and the Dordogne. www.brunochiefofpolice.com<p><i>Chapter 1</i></p><p>Bruno Courr�ges, chief of police of the small French town of St. Denis, awoke a few seconds before six, just as the dawn was breaking. His cockerel, Blanco, named for a French rugby hero, greeted the new day as Bruno donned his tracksuit and running shoes. The morning jog through the springtime woods around his home in the P�rigord countryside was a delight as the sun cast long beams through the pale green of the new buds and leaves on the trees. The temperature was exactly as he liked it, not cold enough for gloves but crisp and fresh enough for him to enjoy warming up as he ran, his basset hound, Balzac, bounding along at his side.</p><p>Back at his home, its old stone walls glowing in the early light, Bruno fed his geese and chickens, watered his vegetable garden and took a look at the seedlings in the new greenhouse he had built from a kit. He placed his kettle on the stove for coffee and put one of his fresh eggs into a saucepan to boil while he checked his e--mails, then turned on the radio, tuned to France Bleu P�rigord. He grilled the last half of yesterday&#x2019;s baguette, shared it with Balzac and sliced his toast thin so he could dip it into the egg yolk. The national radio news ended and shifted to the local news. At the third item, Bruno pricked up his ears.</p><p><i>P�rigueux psychologist Marie--France Duteiller has filed a complaint with the </i>procureur<i> on the slow progress of the investigation into allegations of pedophilia at a church--run children&#x2019;s home near Mussidan some thirty years ago. She claims that the inquiry led by Chief Detective Jean--Jacques Jalipeau has been &#x201c;insensitive and dilatory&#x201d; and has denied justice to the victims who accused several local notables of abuse when they were orphans at the home. Commissaire Ja-li-peau said last night that inquiries continued, although the investigation was highly complex and controversial, since the allegations depended on memories that had been recovered during hypnosis by psychologist Duteiller.</i></p><p>His good mood of the morning evaporated as Bruno sighed in sympathy with his friend Jean--Jacques, known throughout the police as J--J. The investigation had been under way for months and evidently was not getting very far. This was unusual. Bruno might agree that at times J--J could be insensitive, but &#x201c;dilatory&#x201d; was one of the last words he&#x2019;d use to describe the big, untidy man whom he&#x2019;d come to admire on the occasions they had worked together. Such cases usually ended with a celebratory dinner, at which J--J played generous host, in recognition of the many times during the inquiry when he had lunched and dined at Bruno&#x2019;s table. J--J&#x2019;s cheerful personality matched his bulk, and he shared Bruno&#x2019;s fondness for good food and wine. Their warm relations had even survived a waspish newspaper cartoon after one recent terrorist case when Bruno had been portrayed as Ast�rix the Gaul and J--J as his gigantic and overfed friend Ob�lix. The cartoonist had come closer to reality when he portrayed each of them with a bottle of Bergerac wine, suggesting it was their equivalent of the magic potion Ast�rix swigged before battling the Roman legions.</p><p>Above all, and unlike many in the Police Nationale, J--J did not treat a municipal policeman like Bruno as a lower form of life. He&#x2019;d come to value Bruno&#x2019;s profound knowledge of the people of the commune of St. Denis, developed in part through years as an active member of the local tennis, rugby and hunting clubs. He accepted Bruno&#x2019;s idiosyncratic way of doing his job and recognized Bruno&#x2019;s role in ensuring that St. Denis had the lowest rate of reported crimes in the <i>d�partement</i> of the Dordogne. Bruno in return respected J--J as a relentless detective with a deceptively subtle way of navigating the politics of policing in France. Whatever the radio might be reporting, J--J was old enough and experienced enough to take care of himself. If he needed Bruno&#x2019;s help, he knew he would only have to ask.</p><p>Bruno planned this morning to go first to the riding school of his British friend Pamela to exercise his horse, Hector, before heading for his office in the <i>mairie.</i> Perhaps on horseback he&#x2019;d get some inspiration for a speech he had to give at a wedding at the end of the week. And perhaps I should think about getting some new clothes, Bruno thought as he scanned his wardrobe with the forthcoming event in mind.</p><p>Two--thirds of the hanging space was occupied by his official dress. There were police uniforms for summer and for winter, plus a full--dress parade uniform and an overcoat. At the back of the cupboard was a separate plastic bag holding his French army reserve uniform with its sergeant&#x2019;s chevrons, in which he was required to report if summoned back to duty. Hanging in the utility room, where he kept the washing machine and the secure cabinet with his guns, were a set of military camouflage that he used for hunting and the old army tracksuit he had just taken off to air after his morning jog.</p><p>Bruno had few civilian clothes. There was a dark blue wool suit he&#x2019;d bought when invalided out of the French army after taking a sniper&#x2019;s bullet in his hip during a tour of duty in Bosnia. He&#x2019;d long since lost the extra kilos he&#x2019;d gained during his months--long hospital stay and while convalescing, so it hung loosely on him these days. A dark blue blazer and a pair of gray slacks shared a wooden coat hanger. Khaki chinos hung with the dark red jacket that he wore over his uniform shirt and trousers when he wanted to look plausibly civilian. Its equivalent in black was kept in his official van. A pair of jeans was folded on the top shelf with his polo shirts, sweaters, his police k�pis and a blue UN peacekeepers&#x2019; helmet that he kept for sentimental reasons, despite its dents and scrapes.</p><p>Anyone could take one glance at my wardrobe, he mused, and tell the story of my life: the army and then the police, all the signs of a man more at home in uniform than in civilian dress. His modest collection of clothes suggested a man who was careful with his money, seeing no need to spend much on new garments when the French services took care of most of his needs. His dark suit was timeless, of a classic cut, paying no regard to the whims of fashion that dictated that this year trousers should be tight and ties and lapels narrow.</p><p>He knew this was a sparse wardrobe, even for a country policeman. I am a man, he thought, of little imagination and less style; or perhaps I simply have other priorities. Bruno disliked shopping for clothes, although he could spend many hours happily perusing hunting magazines for a new shotgun that he could not afford or a new rod for when he went fishing with the baron.</p><p>The good thing about weddings, he thought, was that people usually had eyes only for the bride. Nobody would care what he was wearing; the dark blue suit would do fine. The ceremony was to take place in the <i>mairie,</i> followed by a reception and dinner for close friends at the National Museum of Prehistory in Les Eyzies. The gallery of flints, with its life--size models of early humans wearing skins and holding spears, might be considered an unusual place to choose. Bruno thought it very suitable, since bride and groom were professional archaeologists of renown. Clothilde, the bride, was the museum&#x2019;s senior curator, and her husband--to--be, Horst, after retiring from his university post in Germany, had joined the museum as an adjunct professor responsible for archaeological digs. Most of the guests were in the same profession.</p><p>Idly, Bruno wondered if they might offer the fashionable Paleolithic diet of nuts and berries, fruit and charred meats, instead of the more traditional wedding feast. No, he concluded. Horst might be amused by such a meal, but Clothilde was a sensible Frenchwoman&#x2014;-she would understand that when guests came to the culinary heartland of France, they expected the classic food of the P�rigord.</p><p>As Horst&#x2019;s best man, Bruno was a little nervous about the speech he&#x2019;d have to give. He would obviously be expected to make some reference to his friend&#x2019;s distinguished career in archaeology, before an audience that would include some of Europe&#x2019;s top experts in the field. On Bruno&#x2019;s bedside table lay the latest issue of <i>Arch�ologie,</i> a popular magazine that contained Professor Horst Vogelstern&#x2019;s latest article, comparing the various small statues of women that had been found at prehistoric sites across Europe.</p><p>Long before he had become Horst&#x2019;s friend, Bruno had sub- scribed to the journal, fascinated by the wealth of cave art and prehistory that surrounded him in the valley of the River V�z�re. The cover of the magazine was arresting, a photograph of a woman fashioned from clay with gigantic hips, a prominent vulva and pendulous breasts. The caption was &#x201c;Miss Europa, 25,000 b.c.&#x201d; This Venus of Doln� V&#x11b;stonice, the place where she had been found in the modern--day Czech Republic, was the oldest ceramic known. It was just one of several illustrations accompanying Horst&#x2019;s fascinating piece.</p><p>Bruno had been intrigued to learn that just over a hundred of these statues, known as the Venus figurines, had been found. They had mostly been made between 28,000 and 20,000 b.c., in the early Paleolithic or Stone Age, and had emerged in caves and graves scattered from Spain through France and Germany to Siberia and south through Italy and the Balkans to Syria and Israel. If there was one outstanding element that could be said to have connected our direct ancestors among early Stone Age peoples, Horst argued, it was their fascination with amply proportioned women. Usually between five and twenty centimeters in height, the figurines were the first--known depictions of any human form, and they were highly stylized. The women had with rare exceptions enormous breasts, buttocks and thighs, a swollen stomach and a prominent pudendum. Some had complex and carefully carved hairstyles, or perhaps headdresses made of small shells, rather like the one that was on display in the Les Eyzies museum.</p><p>Inevitably they had been seen as fertility symbols, since they focused so much on the female breasts and reproductive organs. Countless bookshelves had been written on these figurines and their role in prehistoric culture. There was speculation on whether they signified an early matriarchal society, in which female fertility was the great mystery and object of worship. Some feminist scholars interpreted this to mean that women had ruled the families and perhaps also the tribes. Most scholars, however, sought to place these Venus figurines into the mysterious context of prehistoric art in general. Some tried to discern timeless concepts of beauty and proportion from these limited and somewhat blowsy foundations. But all could agree that these figurines appeared to coincide with the explosion of human creativity, between the first great work of cave art at Chauvet in France, some thirty thousand years old with its extraordinary depictions of horses and other beasts, and the masterpiece of the Lascaux cave in the V�z�re Valley, some seventeen thousand years old. Chauvet and Lascaux portrayed almost exclusively animals. The Venus figurines were palpably human.</p><p>The sudden flowering of art in this period had long fascinated historians, wondering what creative magic had begun suddenly to touch our ancestors. Why were these supposedly primitive creatures suddenly inspired to start making an art that is instantly appealing to modern humans, who recognize instinctively an aesthetic sensibility akin to our own?&nbsp;</p><p>All this, Bruno told himself, provided excellent material for a lighthearted and slightly teasing speech to be made at the wedding. He could talk of Horst&#x2019;s lifelong fascination with the Venus figurines and the female form and his endless pursuit of perfection in the shape of Clothilde. That gave Bruno a theme that would flatter both bride and groom and refer to their common passion for prehistory. He would also suggest that this marriage of the Frenchwoman Dr. Clothilde Daumier and a German symbolized all that was best of the new Europe.</p><p>Jotting down these notes, Bruno felt a weight lift from his shoulders. He dreaded having to give speeches and as a result put so much effort into preparing them that his friends kept pestering him to speak. At least this one was now sketched out, though he knew a few hours of careful drafting still awaited him, part of a busy day ahead. He was due to give evidence before a tribunal in Sarlat at ten, so Bruno checked his appearance in the bedroom mirror, summoned Balzac from his morning patrol of the garden and was about to set off to the riding school when his phone vibrated. It was Ahmed, one of the professional firemen who led the team of mostly volunteer <i>pompiers</i> in St. Denis. As well as fighting fires, they also acted as the region&#x2019;s emergency medical service.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got an urgent call to Commarque, that ruined ch�teau off the road to Sarlat,&#x201d; Ahmed began. &#x201c;A woman, possibly dead, fallen from the cliff or the castle wall. The guy who phoned it in runs the kiosk at the entrance, said his name was Jean--Philippe Fumel, and he&#x2019;ll be expecting you. Fabiola&#x2019;s on call today, and she&#x2019;s meeting us at the spot. Will we see you there?&#x201d;</p><p>Bruno said that he would join them at the ch�teau and then called the riding school to say that duty called; he could not exercise Hector this morning. Pamela replied that she&#x2019;d just heard the same news from Fabiola, and they&#x2019;d expect him for the evening ride instead.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Bisous,&#x201d;</i> she said as she hung up. It always slightly confused Bruno when Pamela used this affectionate French term, which meant &#x201c;kisses.&#x201d; Their affair had been over for some months, but the mutual attraction that remained reminded him that there was more than friendship between them. He had no time to think of that now. He phoned the <i>mairie</i> to leave a message explaining why he&#x2019;d been called away. Then he thumbed through his phone&#x2019;s address book to find a number for the Count of Commarque, a genial giant of a man who had for the past thirty years mounted an ambitious project of research, restoration and public education at the grandiose ruin his ancestors had built. The count, whom Bruno knew from the rugby club, deserved to know of the accident and might have some useful background to contribute. It was not long after seven in the morning, so Bruno was not surprised when there was no reply. He left a message.</p><p>Before he left, Bruno checked his mailbox at the end of the drive, on which he had painted pas de pub to tell the postman not to deliver the endless supermarket and other advertising brochures that would otherwise clog the box. There was a bank statement and a postcard from London showing an unimpressive modern building captioned as the police headquarters at New Scotland Yard. The message was simple: &#x201c;Wish you were here instead of me. Give Balzac a big hug and a kiss from me, and a little hug for you.&#x201d;</p><p>It was signed with the single initial <i>I,</i> which meant &#x201c;Isabelle,&#x201d; the woman who got away. No, Bruno thought, that wasn&#x2019;t right. When she left the P�rigord for a high--powered job on the staff of the minister of the interior in Paris, she had wanted him to join her. But Bruno could never see himself in some cramped apartment in Paris with no garden, where it...</p></p><h2>The Tempest (Cambridge School Shakespeare)</h2><p>An improved, larger-format edition of the Cambridge School Shakespeare plays, extensively rewritten, expanded and produced in an attractive new design.

Following the story from the Egyptians' prehistoric origins to their conquest by the Persians, Greeks, and Romans, this book resurrects a fascinating society replete with remarkable historical information. It investigates such subjects as the changing nature of life and death in the Nile valley to some of the earliest masterpieces of art, architecture, and literature in the ancient world. The authors--an international team of experts working at the cutting edge of their particular fields--outline the principal sequence of political events, including detailed examinations of the three so-called 'intermediate periods' which were previously regarded as 'dark ages' and are only now beginning to be better understood. They also examine cultural and social patterns, including stylistic developments in art and literature. Addressing the issues surrounding this distinctive culture, vividly relating the rise and fall of ruling dynasties, exploring colorful personalities, and uncovering surprising facts, <em>The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt</em> is certain to enrich our understanding of this endlessly intriguing civilization. <br> "Brimming with...intriguing facts...also provides a first-rate overview of <em>le progr�s Egyptien</em>--from the period when <em>Homo erectus</em> first stalked the land right up to Octavian's triumphant entry into Egypt in 30 BC."--<em>The Times</em> (London) (on the previous edition)<br></p><p>One of the most vexing problems in Egyptology is the question of establishing reliable chronologies, whether through relative methods such as stratigraphy and the dating of artifacts or through more absolute time horizons established by astronomical ephemera or radiometric dating. In this overview of ancient Egypt--meant for advanced students, but accessible to general readers with an interest in the area--Ian Shaw and 13 contributors pay close attention to issues of chronology, reconciling conflicts of dating that mark older scholarship.<p> While doing so, they address other problems in the study of ancient Egypt, such as the lack of material evidence of early humans in the region and the increasing destruction of sites in the face of contemporary urban growth. Elsewhere, they remark on the principal developments that distinguish periods in Egyptian prehistory, such as the Old Kingdom's use of large-scale building projects to consolidate power and "remind people of the greatness of pharaonic civilization," and the Middle and New kingdoms' apparent openness to foreigners, which lent Egypt a cosmopolitan, multicultural air that persisted for centuries during long periods of domination by outside powers such as Persia and Rome. Highly useful as a reference and survey, this handsomely illustrated book is a fine addition to any Egyptophile's collection. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br>Ian Shaw studied Archaeology and Egyptology at Cambridge University, gaining a PhD on the archaeological remains at Tell el-Amarna. He later undertook research into Egyptian quarrying and mining sites as a British Academy Research Fellow at New Hall, Cambridge.

First, it offers not just explanations, but a full course. Each of the twenty-five sessions begins with a discussion of a particular sort of circuit followed by the chance to try it out and see how it actually behaves. Accordingly, students understand the circuit&#39;s operation in a way that is deeper and much more satisfying than the manipulation of formulas. Second, it describes circuits that more traditional engineering introductions would postpone: on the third day, we build a radio receiver; on the fifth day, we build an operational amplifier from an array of transistors. The digital half of the course centers on applying microcontrollers, but gives exposure to Verilog, a powerful Hardware Description Language. Third, it proceeds at a rapid pace but requires no prior knowledge of electronics. Students gain intuitive understanding through immersion in good circuit design.</p><p>Turn to this book if you want to learn about different types of circuits and their behavior. You will gain a deep and intuitive understanding of circuit operation, be exposed to advanced circuit designs, and learn to build analog and digital devices from first principles using basic components.Tom Hayes reached electronics via a circuitous route that started in law school and eventually found him teaching Laboratory Electronics at Harvard, which he has done for twenty-five years.

Not the arenas of screaming fans, not Nirvana or the Foo Fighters, not the induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and certainly not her son, Dave, performing with Sir Paul McCartney at The White House. Theirs had always been a life full of music - the Grohl family sang together on long car trips, harmonising to Motown and David Bowie - yet Virginia never expected her son to become a musician. But when Virginia saw Nirvana play for the first time to crazed applause from thousands of screaming fans, she knew nothing would ever be the same. She was the mother of a rock star. And as Virginia watched her son&#39;s star rise, she often wondered about the other mothers who raised sons and daughters who became rock stars. Were they as surprised as she was about their children&#39;s fame? Virginia often wondered about the mystical force that urges some of us to listen, to play, to surround ourselves with music. She wanted to talk about it with the other mothers whose sons and daughters were sharing stages with Dave, and she decided to seek them out wherever they were. So began a two-year odyssey, where she had conversations with such women from all over the world as Verna Griffin, Dr Dre&#39;s mother, Carolyn Williams, Pharell William&#39;s mother, Janis Winehouse, Amy Winehouse&#39;s mother, Patsy Noah, Adam Levine&#39;s mother, Donna Haim, mother to the Haim sisters and Hester Diamond, Mike D of The Beastie Boys&#39; mother, to name just a few. From Cradle to Stage will appeal to mothers everywhere, but particularly to those with children who march (or play) to the beat of their own drum; and it&#39;s for those children who have their mothers to thank for everything. For music lovers and rock fans, it&#39;s the ultimate backstage pass-for anyone who has wondered what it&#39;s like to be on the inside...looking out at a packed arena. Featuring a foreword by Dave Grohl and exclusive family photographs, interviews are interwoven with the Grohl family story and the resultant book is a very intimate portrait of what makes a rock star.</p><p>Virginia Hanlon Grohl, the mother of Grammy-winning rock star Dave Grohl, retired from a thirty-year teaching career, then jumped on tour buses and planes to travel to rock shows throughout the U.S. and Europe with her son and the Foo Fighters.

She's now enjoying a quieter time in her Sherman Oaks, California home being constantly amazed by the gourmet meals her daughter and son entertain her with (a far cry from their PB &amp; J days) and the wondrous, every-changing beauty of her three granddaughters.Insightful * Daily Telegraph Music Books of the Year *</p><h2>How Catholic Art Saved the Faith: The Triumph of Beauty and Truth in Counter-Reformation Art</h2><p><p>Not long after Martin Luther's defiance of the Church in 1517, dialogue between Protestants and Catholics broke down, brother turned against brother, and devastating religious wars erupted across Europe.

Peter Wilson offers the first new history in a generation of a horrifying conflict that transformed the map of the modern world.</p><p>When defiant Bohemians tossed the Habsburg emperor&#x2019;s envoys from the castle windows in Prague in 1618, the Holy Roman Empire struck back with a vengeance. Bohemia was ravaged by mercenary troops in the first battle of a conflagration that would engulf Europe from Spain to Sweden. The sweeping narrative encompasses dramatic events and unforgettable individuals&#x2015;the sack of Magdeburg; the Dutch revolt; the Swedish militant king Gustavus Adolphus; the imperial generals, opportunistic Wallenstein and pious Tilly; and crafty diplomat Cardinal Richelieu. In a major reassessment, Wilson argues that religion was not the catalyst, but one element in a lethal stew of political, social, and dynastic forces that fed the conflict. </p><p>By war&#x2019;s end a recognizably modern Europe had been created, but at what price? The Thirty Years War condemned the Germans to two centuries of internal division and international impotence and became a benchmark of brutality for centuries. As late as the 1960s, Germans placed it ahead of both world wars and the Black Death as their country&#x2019;s greatest disaster.</p><p>An understanding of the Thirty Years War is essential to comprehending modern European history. Wilson&#x2019;s masterful book will stand as the definitive account of this epic conflict.</p><p>For a map of Central Europe in 1618, referenced on page XVI, please visit the book feature.</p></p><p>Peter H. Wilson is Chichele Professor of the History of War at the University of Oxford.&#x201c;In his monumental study of the causes and the consequences of the Thirty Years War, Wilson challenges traditional interpretations of the war as primarily religious. He explores instead the political, social, economic as well as religious forces behind the conflict...Wilson then provides a meticulous account of the war, introducing some of its great personalities: the crafty General Wallenstein; the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, who preserved his state through canny political treaties and military operations; and Hapsburg archdukes Rudolf and Matthias, the brothers whose quarrels marked the future of Bohemia, Austria and Hungary. By the war's end, ravaged as all the states were by violence, disease and destruction, Europe was more stable, but with sovereign states rather than empires, and with a secular order. Wilson's scholarship and attention to both the details and the larger picture make his the definitive history of the Thirty Years War.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Among continental Europeans, the Thirty Years War is etched in memory...A definitive account has been needed, and now Peter Wilson, one of Britain's leading historians of Germany, has provided it. <i>The Thirty Years War: Europe's Tragedy</i> is a history of prodigious erudition that manages to corral the byzantine complexity of the Thirty Years War into a coherent narrative. It also offers a bracingly novel interpretation. Historians typically portray the Thirty Years War as the last and goriest of Europe's religious wars--a final bonfire of the zealots before the cooler age of enlightened statecraft. Mr. Wilson severely qualifies this conventional wisdom. It turns out that the quintessential war of religion was scarcely one at all...Wilson's masterful account of the Thirty Years War is a reminder that war, and peace, are almost never the offspring of conviction alone.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeffrey Collins</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Only in retrospect did the strife acquire coherence as the Thirty Years' War, and Wilson incisively cuts through its several phases to recount the objectives and options of the warring parties...Confidently argued, clearly written, Wilson's history is superb coverage of this pivotal period in European history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gilbert Taylor</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Peter Wilson's book is a major work, the first new history of the Thirty Years' War in a generation.

It is huge both in its scene-setting and its unfolding narrative detail...It is to Wilson's credit that he can both offer the reader a detailed account of this terrible and complicated war and step back to give due summaries. His scholarship seems to me remarkable, his prose light and lovely, his judgments fair. This is a heavyweight book, no doubt. Sometimes, though, the very best of them have to be.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul Kennedy</b><b>, </b><b><i>Sunday Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Wilson's monumental study captures both the complexities of the political and military transformations and the level of brutality that the endemic struggles unleashed...This will be the defining study of the Thirty Years War for the next generation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>P.

Volume I lays out the vision of the forest garden and explains the basic ecological principles that make it work. In Volume II, Dave Jacke and Eric Toensmeier move on to practical considerations: concrete ways to design, establish, and maintain your own forest garden. Along the way they present case studies and examples, as well as tables, illustrations, and a uniquely valuable "plant matrix" that lists hundreds of the best edible and useful species.</p> <p>Taken together, the two volumes of <em>Edible Forest Gardens</em> offer an advanced course in ecological gardening-one that will forever change the way you look at plants and your environment.</p> <p><strong>What is an edible forest garden?</strong><br> An edible forest garden is a perennial polyculture of multipurpose plants. Most plants regrow every year without replanting: perennials. Many species grow together: a polyculture. Each plant contributes to the success of the whole by fulfilling many functions: multipurpose. In other words, a forest garden is an edible ecosystem, a consciously designed community of mutually beneficial plants and animals intended for human food production. Edible forest gardens provide more than just a variety of foods. The seven F's apply here: food, fuel, fiber, fodder, fertilizer, and "farmaceuticals," as well as fun. A beautiful, lush environment can be a conscious focus of your garden design, or a side benefit you enjoy</p></p><p>"...this book will define the intellectual territory of its subject for at least a generation...Dave Jacke has knit an indigenous practice at once ancient and renascent with the mainstream of scientific exploration.

In its way this book--the first of two volumes--is a sequel to the wonderful Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture (1929) by J. Russell Smith.... Edible Forest Gardens offers a vision of the garden that reaches well beneath its aesthetic surface and into its ecological depths. It reminds us that whatever gardens are an oasis from, they can never be an oasis from the natural world or our own underlying economic needs." --Verlyn Klinkenborg The New York Times Book Review June 5, 2005</p><p>Dave Jacke has been a student of ecology and design since the 1970s, and has run his own ecological design firm&#x2014;Dynamics Ecological Design Associates&#x2014;since 1984.

S. Lewis contemplates the central event at the heart of the Christian faith&#x2014;Jesus&#x2019; crucifixion&#x2014;arguing that the Protestant Reformation did not go far enough in transforming our understanding of its meaning.</p><p>In <em>The Day the Revolution Began</em>, N. T. Wright once again challenges commonly held Christian beliefs as he did in his acclaimed <em>Surprised by Hope</em>. Demonstrating the rigorous intellect and breathtaking knowledge that have long defined his work, Wright argues that Jesus&#x2019; death on the cross was not only to absolve us of our sins; it was actually the beginning of a revolution commissioning the Christian faithful to a new vocation&#x2014;a royal priesthood responsible for restoring and reconciling all of God&#x2019;s creation. </p><p>Wright argues that Jesus&#x2019; crucifixion must be understood within the much larger story of God&#x2019;s purposes to bring heaven and earth together. <em>The Day the Revolution Began</em> offers a grand picture of Jesus&#x2019; sacrifice and its full significance for the Christian faith, inspiring believers with a renewed sense of mission, purpose, and hope, and reminding them of the crucial role the Christian faith must play in protecting and shaping the future of the world.</p></p><p><p>When Jesus of Nazareth died the horrible death of crucifixion at the hands of the Roman army, nobody thought him a hero. His movement was over. Nothing had changed. This was the sort of thing that Rome did best. Caesar was on his throne. Death, as usual, had the last word.</p><p>Except that in this case it didn&#x2019;t. As Jesus&#x2019;s followers looked back on that day, they came up with the shocking, scandalous, nonsensical claim that his death had launched a revolution. That by 6:00 p.m. on that dark Friday the world was a different place. They believed that with this event the one true God had suddenly and dramatically put into operation his plan for the rescue of the world. They saw it as the day the revolution began.&#x201d;</p><p>Leading Bible scholar, Anglican bishop, and bestselling author N. T. Wright argues that the church has lost touch with the revolutionary nature of the cross. Most Christians have been taught a reduced message that the death of Jesus was all about &#x201c;God saving me from my &#x2018;sin&#x2019; so that I could &#x2018;go to heaven.&#x2019;&#x201d; According to Wright, this version misconstrues why Jesus had to die, the nature of our sins, and what our mission is in the world today. </p><p>In his paradigm-shifting book <em>Surprised by Hope,</em> Wright showed that the Bible&#x2019;s message is not that heaven is where we go in the future; rather, the Bible sees the primary movement as heaven coming down to earth, redeeming the world, beginning now. In this companion book, Wright shows how Christianity&#x2019;s central story tells how this revolution began on a Friday afternoon two thousand years ago and continues now through the church&#x2019;s work today. Wright seeks to wake up the church to its own story, to invite us to join in Jesus&#x2019;s work of redeeming the world&#x2014;to join his revolution.</p><p>N. T. Wright, one of the world&#x2019;s leading Bible scholars, is the chair of New Testament and Early Christianity at the School of Divinity at the University of St. Andrews, an Anglican bishop, and bestselling author.

When she opened her storefront that morning and saw a line around the block, she realized she had a more immediate problem: <i>had she made enough pie?</i> The shop closed early that day, but it has been churning out plenty of the Chicago's most delectable pies ever since.<br><br>Since starting her career as a pastry chef at Trio, one of Chicago's top fine-dining restaurants, Haney dreamed of opening her own pie shop. Exhilarating and exhausting days spent creating fabulous new desserts to keep up with the restaurant's head chef--a then-unknown Grant Achatz, who would go on to culinary superstardom--left Haney in search of classic comfort food on her days off. Her disappointment in being unable to find a good slice of pie in all of Chicago led her to one conclusion: she needed to open her own store.<br><br>Specializing in hand-made, artisanal pies that only use locally sourced and in-season ingredients, Hoosier Mama Pie Company has become a local favorite and a national destination gaining praise from <i>Bon Appetit</i>, the Food Network, and <i>Food &amp; Wine</i> as one of the top pie shops in the country. Now, <i>The Hoosier Mama Book of Pie</i> delivers all the sumptuous secrets of buttery crusts, fruity fillings, creams and custards, chess pies, over-the-top pies, and even the stout and hearty savory pie. The practically oriented, easy-going, and accessible style of this book will help bakers both new and old make the perfect pie for every occasion.<br><br>On top of all of this, <i>The Hooser Mama Book of Pie</i> also includes tips on technique, fascinating historical anecdotes, and an emphasis on special seasonal recipes, as well as quiches, hand pies, and scones. This beautifully photographed and designed book has the classic retro feel of the mid-20th century golden age of pie, and all the warmth and personality of the Hoosier Mama Pie Co.'s cozy Chicago storefront. The focus on using local produce and employing the farm-to-table philosophy gives the book a contemporary twist, helping home bakers make the freshest, most delicious pies imaginable. Now readers can take a little piece of the Hoosier Mama Pie Company anywhere they go.</p><p><b>Paula Haney</b> founded Hoosier Mama Pie Company in 2005.

He has shared in two Pulitzer Prizes, first for the <i>Post</i>&#x2019;s coverage of the Watergate scandal with Carl Bernstein, and second in 2003 as the lead reporter for coverage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He has authored or coauthored eighteen books, all of which have been national nonfiction bestsellers. Twelve of those have been #1 national bestsellers.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Scott Armstrong</b> is executive director of the Information Trust. A former reporter for <i>The Washington Post,</i> he founded the National Security Archive and was a senior investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee.<b>Prologue</b> <p> Earl Warren, the Chief Justice of the United States, hailed the elevator operator as if he were campaigning, stepped in and rode to the basement of the Supreme Court Building, where the Court limousine was waiting. Warren easily guided his bulky, 6-foot-1-inch, 220-pound frame into the back seat. Though he was seventy-seven, the Chief still had great stamina and resilience. </p><p> Four young men got into the car with him that fine November Saturday in 1968. They were his clerks, recent law graduates, who for one year were his confidential assistants, ghost writers, extra sons and intimates. They knew the "Warren Era" was about to end. As Chief Justice for fifteen years, Warren had led a judicial revolution that reshaped many social and political relationships in Amer-ica. The Warren Court had often plunged the country into bitter controversy as it decreed an end to publicly supported racial discrimination, banned prayer in the public schools, and extended constitutional guarantees to blacks, poor people, Communists, and those who were questioned, arrested or charged by the police. Warren's clerks revered him as a symbol, the spirit of much that had happened. The former crusading prosecutor, three-term governor of California, and Republican vice-presidential nominee had had, as Chief Justice, a greater impact on the country than most Presidents. </p><p> The clerks loved their jobs. The way things worked in the Chief's chambers gave them tremendous influence. Warren told them how he wanted the cases to come out. But the legal research and the drafting of Court opinions -- even those that had made Warren and his Court famous and infamous -- were their domain. Warren was not an abstract thinker, nor was he a gifted scholar. He was more interested in the basic fairness of decisions than the legal rationales. </p><p> They headed west, downtown, turned into 16th Street and pulled into the circular driveway of the University Club, a private eating and athletic club next to the Soviet Embassy, four blocks north of the White House. The staff was expecting them. This was a Saturday ritual. Warren was comfortable here. His clerks were less so. They never asked him how he could belong to a club that had no black members. </p><p> With his clerks in tow, Warren bounded up the thick-carpeted steps to the grill. It was early for lunch, not yet noon, and the room was empty. Warren liked to start promptly so they would have time for drinks and lunch before the football game. They sat in wooden captain's chairs at a table near the television and ordered drinks. The Chief had his usual gimlet. He was pensive. They ordered another round. Warren reminisced, told political stories, chatted about sports, and then turned to the recent past, to Richard Nixon's election. The Chief thought it was a catastrophe for the country. He could find no redeeming qualities in his fellow California Republican. Nixon was weak, indirect, awkward and double-dealing, and frequently mean-spirited. Throughout the 1968 presidential campaign, Nixon had run against Warren and his Court as much as he had run against his Democratic rival, Senator Hubert Humphrey. Playing on prejudice and rage, particularly in the South, Nixon had promised that his appointees to the Supreme Court would be different. </p><p> It was unlikely that a Nixon Court would reverse all the Warren Court's decisions. Though Justices John Harlan, Potter Stewart and Byron White had dissented from some of the famous Warren decisions, each of them had strong reservations on the matter of the Court's reversing itself. They believed firmly in the doctrine of <i>stare decisis --</i> the principle that precedent governs, that the Court is a continuing body making law that does not change abruptly merely because Justices are replaced. </p><p> But as Warren and his clerks moved to lunch, the Chief expressed his frustration and his foreboding about a Nixon presidency. Earlier that year, before the election, Warren had tried to ensure a liberal successor by submitting his resignation to President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Senate had rejected Johnson's nominee, Associate Justice Abe Fortas, as a "crony" of the Presi-dent. All that had been accomplished was that Nixon now had Warren's resignation on his desk, and he would name the next Chief Justice. </p><p> Warren was haunted by the prospect. Supreme Court appointments were unpredictable, of course. There was, he told his clerks, no telling what a President might do. He had never imagined that Dwight Eisenhower would pick him in 1953. Ike said he had chosen Warren for his "middle of the road philosophy." Later Eisenhower remarked that the appointment was "the biggest damned-fool mistake I ever made." Well, Warren said, Ike was no lawyer. The clerks smiled. But Richard Nixon was, and he had campaign promises to fulfill. He must have learned from Eisen-hower's experience. He would choose a man with clearly defined views, an experienced judge who had been tested publicly on the issues. The President would look for a reliable, predictable man who was committed to Nixon's own philosophy. </p><p> "Who?" asked the clerks. </p><p> "Why don't we all write down on a piece of paper who we think the nominee will be?" Warren suggested with a grin. </p><p> One clerk tore a sheet of paper into five strips and they sealed their choices in an envelope to be opened after Nixon had named his man. </p><p> Warren bent slightly over the polished wooden table to conceal the name he wrote. </p><p> <i>Warren E. Burger.</i> </p><p> Three months later, on the morning of February 4, 1969, Warren Burger, sixty-one, was in his spacious chambers on the fifth floor of the Court of Appeals on Pennsylvania Avenue, almost midway between the White House and the Supreme Court. President Nixon, who had been in office only two weeks, had invited him to swear in several high-ranking government officials at the White House. When he arrived at the mansion, Burger was instantly admitted at the gate. </p><p> Nixon and Burger first met at the Republican National Convention in 1948. Nixon was a freshman Congressman and Burger was floor manager for his home-state candidate, Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen. At the next convention, four years later, Burger played an important role in Eisenhower's nomination. He was named assistant attorney general in charge of the Claims Division in the Justice Department, and in 1956 he was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On that famously liberal court, Burger became the vocal dissenter whose law-and-order opinions made the headlines. He was no bleeding heart or social activist, but a professional judge, a man of solid achievement. </p><p> Now at the White House, the ceremonial swearings-in lasted only a few minutes, but afterward the President invited Burger to the Oval Office. Nixon emphasized the fact that as head of the Executive Branch he was deeply concerned about the judiciary. There was a lot to be done. </p><p> Burger could not agree more, he told the President. </p><p> Nixon told him that in one of his campaign addresses he had used two points from a speech Burger had given in 1967 at Ripon College in Wisconsin. <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> had reprinted it under the title "What to Do About Crime in U.S." The men agreed that <i>U.S. News</i> was the country's best weekly news magazine, a Republican voice in an overwhelmingly liberal press. Burger had brought a copy of the article with him. </p><p> In his speech Burger had charged that criminal trials were too often long delayed and subsequently encumbered with too many appeals, retrials and other procedural protections for the accused that had been devised by the courts. </p><p> Burger had argued that five-to-ten-year delays in criminal trials undermined the public's confidence in the judicial system. Decent people felt anger, frustration and bitterness, while the criminal was encouraged to think that his free lawyer would somewhere find a technical loophole that would let him off. He had pointed to progressive countries like Holland, Denmark and Sweden, which had simpler and faster criminal justice systems. Their prisons were better and were directed more toward rehabilitation. The murder rate in Sweden was 4 percent of that in the United States. He had stressed that the United States system was presently tilted toward the criminal and needed to be corrected. </p><p> Richard Nixon was impressed. This was a voice of reason, of enlightened conservatism -- firm, direct and fair. Judge Burger knew what he was talking about. The President questioned him in some detail. He found the answers solid, reflecting his own views, and supported with evidence. Burger had ideas about improving the efficiency of judges. By reducing the time wasted on routine administrative tasks and mediating minor pretrial wrangles among lawyers, a judge could focus on his real job of hearing cases. Burger also was obviously not a judge who focused only on individual cases. He was concerned about the system, the prosecutors, the accused, the victims of crime, the prisons, the effect of home, school, church and community in teaching young people discipline and respect. </p><p> The President was eager to appoint solid conservatives to federal judgeships throughout the country. As chairman of a prestigious American Bar Association committee, Burger had traveled around the country and must know many people who could qualify. The President wanted to appoint men of Burger's caliber to the federal bench, including the Supreme Court. Though the meeting was lasting longer than he had planned, the President buzzed for his White House counsel, John Ehrlichman. </p><p> Ehrlichman came down from his second-floor office in the West Wing. Nixon introduced them. "Judge Burger has brought with him an article that is excellent. Make sure that copies are circulated to others on the White House staff," Nixon said. He added that Burger had constructive, solid ideas on the judicial system as well as for their anticrime campaign. Judge Burger was a man who had done his homework. "Please make an appointment with him to talk," the President said, "and put into effect what he ...</p></p><h2>Violet Flame: Alchemy for Personal Change</h2><p>Four-Color Paperback:<br><br><br>Mrs. Prophet shares how we can harness the power of the violet flame through practical and effective spiritual techniques that can help to restore health, balance and harmony and aide in creating positive and lasting changes in our lives, the lives of our loved ones and the world around us. <br><br></p><p>Elizabeth Clare Prophet is a pioneer of modern spirituality and an internationally renowned author.

Best-selling author, Edward Rutherfurd has lived in Dublin for the past decade; with the help of some of Ireland&#39;s leading historians, he has researched this epic and groundbreaking novel of the city. Rutherfurd managed to encapsulate the drama of Salisbury, Moscow, London and the New Forest in one volume in his previous best-sellers &#34;Sarum&#34;, &#34;Russka&#34;, &#34;London&#34; and &#34;The Forest&#34;. But such was the wealth of new material uncovered for this volume, Rutherfurd has taken the unprecedented step of splitting the hardback publication in two. The first of the two books, &#34;Dublin: Foundation&#34;, will take us from prehistory, the High Kings of Tara, the Viking invasion, the machinations of Henry II and the greed of Henry VIII to the burning of the saint&#39;s relics in front of Christchurch cathedral in 1538. At the end of this majestically sweeping narrative, Rutherfurd effectively closes the story of the &#39;Irish&#39; Irish: the descendants of Fingall and Cuchulainn, the princes and Kings of Tara of Brian Boru and the spiritual descendants of Patrick himself. The second novel, &#34;Dublin: Ascendancy&#34; taking the story of Dublin from the 16th Century will appear in 2006 and in 2007. The two volumes will be combined in a single volume in Arrow paperback.</p><p>Edward Rutherfurd was born in England, in the cathedral city of Salisbury. Educated locally, and at the universities of Cambridge, and Stanford, California, he worked in political research, bookselling and publishing. After numerous attempts to write books and plays, he finally abandoned his career in the book trade in 1983, and returned to his childhood home to write Sarum. Four years later, when the book was published, it became an instant international bestseller, remaining 23 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List. Since then he has written seven more bestsellers: Russka, a novel of Russia; London; The Forest, set in England&#39;s New Forest which lies close by Sarum; two novels which cover the story of Ireland from the time just before Saint Patrick to the twentieth century; New York; and Paris.

Pennebaker uses his groundbreaking research in computational linguistics-in essence, counting the frequency of words we use-to show that our language carries secrets about our feelings, our self-concept, and our social intelligence. Our most forgettable words, such as pronouns and prepositions, can be the most revealing: their patterns are as distinctive as fingerprints.</p><p>Using innovative analytic techniques, Pennebaker X-rays everything from John McCain's tweets to the Federalist Papers.

Or that a world leader's use of pronouns could reliably presage whether he will lead his country into war?

A very comprehensive boatbuilding book and highly recommended.</i><br> -- Water Craft </p><p> <i>A</i> Woodworking Magazine <i>Top 40 Book</i> </p><p> Now revised and expanded with 32 pages of color and an updated resources section, this 70,000-copy international bestseller, known as the 'Bible of canoe building' is back, bigger and better than ever. </p><p> Ted Moores is a master builder of woodstrip/epoxy canoes. Over four decades teaching wooden-boat construction, he discovered that the same dream motivates all of his students, no matter their age: to build something beautiful and functional. </p><p> <i>Canoecraft</i> is the road map to that dream. Moores offers comprehensive instructions for the first-time builder, and for the second-time builder. He adds a variety of canoe plans, each presented as a traditional table of offsets. There is also a series of builder's tips and techniques, and an entire chapter on carving a paddle, the perfect accompaniment to a handcrafted canoe. </p><p> Whether the goal is to build a general-purpose recreational canoe, or an efficient modern tripping canoe, or a full-decked fast-cruising canoe with walnut veneer, <i>Canoecraft</i> is the ideal guide to making it happen successfully. </p></p><p><p> Ted Moores is a best-selling author. In 1972, Moores pioneered the woodstrip/epoxy boatbuilding system for canoes and, since then, has promoted the fine art of wooden-canoe and kayak construction. He is the author of <i>Kayaks You Can Build</i>. </p><p>Introduction to the Second Edition</p> <p>I saw my first woodstrip canoe in 1971, over 40 years ago. I was working as a freelance commercial artist in downtown Toronto, Ontario, and was looking for a way out of the city and out of the job. Every weekend, I would drive north, up Highway 11, and as I drove through the little village of Trout Creek, I'd see a couple of beautiful wooden canoes stretched out on the lawn of a fellow I eventually came to know, Ross Ellery. Ross had started out building strip-planked/polyester-resin/ fiberglass-reinforced marathon canoes for his own use, and before he knew it, he was in the canoe business. </p> <p>Being a dreamer, I didn't find it hard to visualize a peaceful life in cottage country, building beautiful boats for people who would line up at the door, with money in hand, begging for one of my swift little craft. It pays to be naive: a person can do a lot when he doesn't know any better. </p> <p>I began building boats in 1972 in Gravenhurst, Ontario, but after only two years of life at Sundance Canoes, where I discovered the hard reality of operating a labor-intensive craft business on my own, I sold the business to Greavette Boats and escaped even farther from the big city to a hilltop, known as Bear Mountain, on the northern edge of Algonquin Park. </p> <p>When I sold Sundance, I was already having worries about the instability of the polyester-resin system I was using, but I hadn't lost the boatbuilding dream. Perhaps it was the blood of seafaring ancestors in my veins. It certainly wasn't my upbringing: I was a city boy who had worked every summer since the age of 9, missing out on the usual Canadian boy's introduction to canoes at summer camp. </p> <p>After learning about the epoxy resins being developed by the Gougeon Brothers and reading in John Wilson's <i>Woodenboat Magazine</i> about the wooden-boat revival in the eastern United States, I decided to give boatbuilding another try. My partner Joan Barrett and I were still looking for a way to earn a satisfying living in the country working for ourselves. We built a stone house with a workshop attached and named the business the Bear Mountain Boat Shop, a name that has stuck through half a dozen moves, first to Bancroft, then south to Peterborough, the heartland of Canada's historic canoebuilders. </p> <p>I started as a builder of canoes and added boat restoration as I became more and more interested in the history of the craft. Now I spend my time building 30-foot racing canoes, producing plans for amateur builders, preparing books, teaching wooden-boat building and helping out at the Canadian Canoe Museum. Over the years, I have met a lot of amateur builders, both those who have bought <i>Canoecraft</i> and those who have signed up to build a boat with me. </p> <p>When I think about it, the faces of so many of these people come back to me: the airline pilot who was scheduled for a second triple bypass and wanted to leave something of himself to each of his five daughters; the administrator of a juvenile correctional institution who started building a boat in his office to relieve the stress and, before long, was approached by his rebellious clients, who crowded into his office, asking questions, offering to help; the family that came, three generations at once, to build a boat together. I've taught people as young as 11 and as old as 87, and if I've learned anything, it's that anyone with the proper attention span can do it. </p> <p>Most of these builders are motivated, at least in part, by a dream. Many have been harboring the urge to build something beautiful for decades, while they raised children and pursued careers, and only now, at retirement age, are they in the position to do something for themselves. </p> <p>I am always amazed at the number of people who find the decision to build a small boat a pivotal point in their lives. Maybe this is because building a good boat has all the components of a life under control. Working through the building, step-by-step, from thoughtful preparation and careful execution to the reward of a finished boat is a pattern of living that makes sense. Learning to respond to and to work in harmony with materials can tell us something about getting along with ourselves and others. Finding a fair curve requires looking at a line from many different perspectives before making up your mind -- not a bad life lesson either, when you think about it. </p> <p>Because of the attention to detail I recommend in these pages, a reader might be inclined to take me for a perfectionist. But the truth is that after more than 27 years of building wooden boats, I have yet to build one that wouldn't be different next time. Perfection is a journey. The point for me--and I hope for you--is to take pleasure in where you are today, believing that it will be somewhere else tomorrow. </p> <p>Looking back over the years, I can see that my initial inexperience has in many ways proved an asset. I started building boats with a technique that was still in the experimental stage. I had no woodworking or boatbuilding experience, which meant that the learning curve was slow and frustratingly steep at times; but the solutions I eventually worked out for myself were ones that produced good results in the shortest time, using common sense and simple tools. Had I been a boatbuilder by trade, or an engineer, the system I developed would not have been as accessible to amateur builders like myself. </p> <p>The rightness of my approach lies in this book, which has been continuously in print for more than 40 years. It was ahead of its time when I first wrote it with my friend and northern neighbor Merilyn Mohr. When <i>Canoecraft</i> was published in 1983, little information was available on building woodstrip /epoxy canoes. The book quickly became the most used and most respected text on this method of canoe construction, accepted internationally as "the Bible of canoebuilding." It sold more than 100,000 copies in North America and in 1996 was translated into German. </p> <p>Although it was updated regularly with each reprinting (the first edition went through 10 reprints), I eventually felt the need to update the text with new materials and tools and the techniques that I have learned over the years. I know a lot more about the craft of canoebuilding now than I did in 1983, and after a decade of teaching workshops, I have learned a few things myself. </p> <p>Casual boatbuilders are better educated and more sophisticated than they used to be. Teaching kayak- and canoebuilding to about 100 students every year has given me a better idea of the skill level of the typical builder. A growing number of potential builders are about 50 years old, with the majority of these being professionals who need to occupy their time as their careers wind down. These people want concise information presented in a language they can understand. Even though their standards are high and they expect a lot of themselves, this is a vulnerable period in their lives. Instructions, I've discovered, must be complete enough that the boat they build will be of professional quality the first time. </p> <p>In preparing this second edition, I have tried to offer something for the second-time builder too. I have included a larger variety of plans, many of them different from those in the first edition. To avoid confusion, plans are now presented as a traditional table of offsets. I have added a series of builder's tips--tricks of the trade that those familiar with basic woodworking will especially appreciate. I have also included some new techniques--such as building a stapleless boat--and a whole new chapter on carving a paddle, the perfect accompaniment to your handmade canoe. Fans of the original <i>Canoecraft</i> will also notice that the book has been redesigned for easier reading and that the photographs have been reshot and now follow a single boat--a 16-foot Redbird--through every stage of construction. </p> <p>I started building canoes with the assumption that a person can get professional results if good materials are used and simple steps are performed with care in the proper orde</p></p><h2>What Works: Gender Equality by Design</h2><p><p><b>Shortlisted for the <i>Financial Times</i> and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award</b><br><b>A <i>Financial Times</i> Best Business Book of the Year</b><br><b>A <i>Times Higher Education</i> Book of the Week</b><br><b>Best Business Book of the Year, 800-CEO-READ</b></p><p>Gender equality is a moral and a business imperative.

Though Jolicoeur claims that his work is appropriate for the amateur cider maker, his perspective as a mechanical engineer results in a book that is far too technical, dense, and text heavy for a novice. However, its accuracy and tone will be of value for serious hobbyists and small-scale professional cider makers."</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Booklist-</strong></em> "Jolicoeur is a mechanical engineer who delights in the details of cider-making, from calculations and formulas to spreadsheets. Based in Quebec, he 'discovered' cider in 1988 after finding rows of abandoned apple trees on newly acquired land. His vocation and avocation combine to bring readers a step-by-step guide with a number of color photographs. It starts simply enough, with an overview of the process, apple growing and selection, and seven principles for producing the best, from 'good cider needs great apples&#x201d; to &#x201c;remember what you did.' After a careful review of dozens of regional apple varieties (and a few pears, to make the cider equivalent called perry), complete with notes on sugar, acidity, tannin, juice yield, harvest date, and pressing season, he dives into the more difficult processes, including juice extraction, fermentation, and troubleshooting. Some good chemistry basics help, as do an 'I can build it' mentality and competency."</p></p><h2>Red Queen (The Chronicles of Alice)</h2><p><b>The author of <i>Alice</i> takes readers back down the rabbit hole to a dark, twisted, and fascinating world based on the works of Lewis Carroll...</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> The land outside of the Old City was supposed to be green, lush, hopeful.

He sat in a parlor covered in roses and this little man was small and neat, his head covered in golden-brown ringlets and his eyes bright and green like a rose&#x2019;s leaves. He wore a velvet suit of rose red and he urged a cup of tea on his visitor, a wide-eyed girl who looked about her in wonder. She was not certain how she&#x2019;d gotten here, only that this strange little man had helped her when she thought she was lost.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you like stories?&#x201d; the little man asked.</p><p>He was called Cheshire, and the girl thought that was a very odd name, though this room and his cottage were very pretty.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. She was very young still, and did not know yet what Cheshire had saved her from when he came upon her wandering in the streets near his cottage. She was lucky, more than lucky, that it was he who found her.</p><p>&#x201c;I like stories too,&#x201d; Cheshire said. &#x201c;I collect them. I like this story because I have a part to play in it&#x2014;a small part, to be sure, but a part nonetheless.</p><p>&#x201c;Once, there was a girl called Alice, and she lived in the New City, where everything is shining and beautiful and fair. But Alice was a curious girl with a curious talent. She was a Magician. Do you know what a Magician is?&#x201d;</p><p>The girl shook her head. &#x201c;But I have heard of them. They could do wonders but the ministers drove all the Magicians out of the City long ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Cheshire said, and winked. &#x201c;They thought they did, but a few Magicians remained. And Alice was one of them, though she did not know it yet.</p><p>&#x201c;She had magic, and because of that she was vulnerable, and a girl who was supposed to be Alice&#x2019;s friend sold her for money to a very bad man called the Rabbit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was a rabbit?&#x201d; the girl asked, confused.</p><p>&#x201c;Not really, though he had rabbit ears on a man&#x2019;s body,&#x201d; Cheshire said. &#x201c;The Rabbit hurt Alice, and wanted to hurt her more, wanted to sell her to a man called the Walrus who ate girls for their magic.&#x201d;</p><p>The wide-eyed girl put her cup of tea on Cheshire&#x2019;s rose-covered table and stared. &#x201c;Ate? Like really eat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes, my dear,&#x201d; Cheshire said. &#x201c;He ate them all up in his belly. But Alice was quick and clever and she got away from the Rabbit before he could feed her to the Walrus. The Rabbit marked Alice, though, marked her with a long scar on her face to say she was his. My resourceful Alice marked him too&#x2014;she took his eye out.</p><p>&#x201c;But little Alice, she was broken and sad and confused, and her parents locked her away in a hospital for confused people. There she met a madman with an axe named Hatcher, a madman who grew to love her.</p><p>&#x201c;Hatcher and Alice escaped from the hospital, and traveled through the Old City in search of their pasts and in search of a monster called the Jabberwocky who made the streets run with blood and corpses.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl shuddered. &#x201c;I know about him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then I should tell you that Alice, clever Alice, turned him into a butterfly with her magic so that he could never hurt anyone again, and she put that butterfly in a jar in her pocket and there he is till this day&#x2014;unless he is dead, which is entirely possible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what of the Rabbit and the Walrus?&#x201d; the girl asked. &#x201c;What became of them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing good, my dear,&#x201d; Cheshire said. &#x201c;Nothing good at all, for they were bad men and bad men meet bad ends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As they should,&#x201d; the girl said firmly. &#x201c;What about Alice? Did she have a happy ending?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Cheshire said.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>Part One</p><p>The <br>Forest</p><p></p><br><p>Alice was a Magician, albeit one who did not know very much about her own magic. She was escaping a City that hated and feared Magicians, which was one of the reasons why she didn&#x2019;t know so very much about it. Alice was tall and blue-eyed and a little broken inside, but her companion didn&#x2019;t mind because his insides were more jumbled than hers could ever be.</p><p>Hatcher was a murderer, and he knew quite a lot about it. Alice thought that Hatcher knew so much about it that he ought to be capitalized too&#x2014;a Magician and her Murderer. He was tall and grey-eyed and mad and dangerous but he loved her too, and so they stayed together, both stumbling toward a future that would let them leave their past in the past.</p><p>She wished she could do something magical like in a fairy story&#x2014;make a carpet to fly on, or summon up a handy unicorn to ride. It seemed very useless to be a Magician without spectacular tricks at hand.</p><p>At the very least she would have liked to be able to summon a bicycle, though the thought of Hatcher balancing on two wheels while holding his axe made her giggle. Anything would be better than this tunnel, an endless, narrow semidarkness with no relief in sight. She never would have entered it had she known it would take so long to get out again&#x2014;three days at least, by her reckoning.</p><p>Alice thought it must be close to that long, although they had no true way to determine the passage of time.</p><p>They slept when they were tired, ate what little provisions they had left in the sack Hatcher carried. Soon enough they were hungry and thirsty, though it had become a familiar feeling and therefore just another discomfort. Food and water never seemed to be a regular occurrence since their escape from the hospital and its regular delivery of porridge morning and night.</p><p>During the long walk Alice dreamed of the open fields and trees that she would find at the end, a beautiful verdant land described by Pipkin, the rabbit they rescued from the Walrus&#x2019; fight ring. Anything, she thought, would be better than the crushing fog and darkness of the Old City.</p><p>Hatcher, in his own Hatcher way, alternated between moody silence and fits of mania. When not brooding he would run ahead of Alice and then back again over and over until he was white and breathless. Sometimes he stopped to box with the walls until his hands were bloody, or take chunks out of the wall with his axe. It seemed to Alice that there was more brooding and less running about than usual, though to be fair he had more to brood on.</p><p>He&#x2019;d just remembered he had a daughter, more than ten years after she&#x2019;d been sold to a trader far to the East. It wasn&#x2019;t really his fault that he&#x2019;d forgotten her, because the events of that day had turned him from Nicholas into the mad Hatcher he was now. Alice suspected that there was guilt and anger and helplessness all churned up inside him, and these feelings mixed with his dreams of blood and sometimes she saw all of this running over his face but he never spoke of it.</p><p>And, Alice thought, he&#x2019;s probably a bit angry with me for putting him to sleep when it was time to face the Jabberwocky.</p><p>Alice didn&#x2019;t regret the decision, though she knew it didn&#x2019;t suit Hatcher&#x2019;s notion of himself as her protector. Hatcher had a tendency to swing his axe first and think later, and as it happened, no blood-spilling had been required to defeat the ancient Magician.</p><p>She felt the reassuring weight of the little jar in her pants pocket, deliberately turned her mind away from it. Soon enough the Jabberwocky inside would be dead, if he were not already.</p><p>The tunnel, which proceeded along level ground since the initial entry into the Old City, sloped abruptly upward. It was then that Alice noticed the lanterns set at intervals had disappeared and that the interior of the cave was lightening.</p><p>Hatcher trotted up the steep incline while Alice labored after him, tripping several times and clawing in the dirt to push her body upright. Everything always seemed much harder for Alice, who was not as strong nor as graceful as Hatcher. Occasionally it seemed that her body was actively working against her progress.</p><p>When they finally emerged, blinking in the sunlight, Alice decided her disposition was not well suited to a life underground.</p><p>She crawled over the lip of the cave entrance, half blind after days underground and squinting through slitted eyes, expecting the soft brush of grass beneath her fingers. Instead there was something that felt like very fine ash, and a few scrubby grey plants poking brave faces toward the sun.</p><p>Alice forced her eyes to open wide. It took much more effort than it ought to; her eyes did not want all that glaring light and kept stubbornly closing against her will.</p><p>Hatcher ran ahead, already adjusted and seemingly glorying in the freedom after the constraint of the tunnel. She was aware of him as a half-formed shadow through her partially closed lids. He stopped suddenly, and his stillness made Alice struggle to her feet and take a proper look around. Once, she had she almost wished she hadn&#x2019;t, for this wasn&#x2019;t an improvement over their recent tunnel life.</p><p>They had emerged on the side of a hill that faced what must have once been an open meadow, perhaps dotted with wildflowers and trees and filled with tall grasses. Now there was nothing before them but a blackened waste stretching for miles, broken only by the occasional mound or hill.</p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t what we expected,&#x201d; Hatcher said.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Alice said, her voice faint. &#x201c;What happened here?&#x201d;</p><p>Hatcher shrugged. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no one around to ask.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice fought down the tears that threatened as she looked at the blight all around them. There was nothing to cry about here&#x2014;no criminals kidnapping women, no streets lined with blood and corpses, no Rabbit to steal her away.</p><p>It&#x2019;s only a wasteland. There&#x2019;s no one here to hurt you or Hatcher. You can survive this. This is nothing.</p><p>Perhaps if she repeated this to herself often enough she could make it true. This is nothing, nothing at all.</p><p>But the promise of paradise beyond the walls of the City had sustained her, the dream of a mountain valley and the lake and a sky that was actually blue instead of grey. To have been through so much and discovered only this burned-out land seemed such a poor reward that crying seemed the only reasonable option. She let a few disappointed tears fall, saw them drop into the ash beneath her feet and immediately disappear. Then she scrubbed her face and told herself that was enough of that, thank you very kindly.</p><p>Alice walked around the hill to see what lay in the other direction. The New City sparkled in the distance, its high walls and tall white buildings shimmering on the horizon. Caught within the ring of the New City was the blackened sore of the Old City, completely encircled by its neighbor.</p><p>&#x201c;I never realized it was so big,&#x201d; Alice said as Hatcher joined her. His burst of energy had passed and he was subdued again, though by his troubles or by the landscape Alice did not know.</p><p>The combined Cities were a vast blot upon the landscape, stretching into the horizon. Of course it must be tremendous, Alice thought. It took them many days to cross from the hospital to the Rabbit&#x2019;s lair, and still they had seen only a fraction of the Old City. The close-packed structures of the Old City had, somehow, made it seem smaller.</p><p>&#x201c;Now what to do?&#x201d; Alice muttered, returning to the cave entrance. Hatcher trailed behind her, silent, his mind obviously elsewhere.</p><p>They had counted upon being able to forage for food and water once they escaped the tunnel, but that seemed impossible now.</p><p>&#x201c;There must be a village or town somewhere,&#x201d; she said to Hatcher. &#x201c;Not everyone in the world comes from the City. And there must be something beyond this blight, else Cheshire and the other Magicians would not have been interested in maintaining the tunnel.&#x201d;</p><p>Hatcher crouched and ran his fingers through the dark substance that covered the ground. &#x201c;It was all burned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Alice agreed. &#x201c;But burned unnaturally, somehow. That doesn&#x2019;t seem like ordinary fire ash.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Magic?&#x201d; Hatcher asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But why would a Magician want to burn all the land in sight? And how recently has all this occurred? It seems the burning goes right up to the edge of the New City. How was it that the City was not burned too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever happened, you can be certain that no one in the City was told of it,&#x201d; Hatcher said.</p><p>&#x201c;But the residents of the New City,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;How could such a thing occur without their notice?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You once lived in the New City,&#x201d; Hatcher said. &#x201c;Did you notice anything that you weren&#x2019;t told to notice by the ministers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Alice admitted. &#x201c;But then, I was a child when I lived there. I didn&#x2019;t notice much beyond my own garden, and my governess, and my family.&#x201d;</p><p>And Dor, she thought, but she didn&#x2019;t say it aloud. Little Dor-a-mouse, scuttling for the Rabbit. Dor, who had sold Alice to a man who&#x2019;d raped her, who&#x2019;d tried to break her. Dor, her best friend in all the world.</p><p>Thinking of Dor made Alice remember their tea party with the Rabbit and the Walrus, and the enormous plate of cakes, beautiful cakes with high crowns of brightly colored frosting. She&#x2019;d give anything for a cake right now, although not one of the Rabbit&#x2019;s cakes, which had been filled with powders to make her sick and compliant.</p><p>For a moment she wished for one of Cheshire&#x2019;s magic parcels filled with food, but then remembered that such a thing would require a connection to Cheshire that she didn&#x2019;t want.</p><p>She might be able to summon up food for them. Her only excuse for not doing such a thing before was that she wasn&#x2019;t yet accustomed to the idea of being a Magician. Perhaps, when they were far from the City, she could search for another Magician, one who might teach her. They couldn&#x2019;t all be terrible, couldn&#x2019;t all be like the Caterpillar and the Rabbit and Cheshire and the Jabberwocky.</p><p>She must stop thinking of the Jabberwocky. The wish had said she would forget him, and he would die because of that. So she needed to forget, because she never again wanted to see the results of the Jabberwocky&#x2019;s rage. The streets of the Old City lined with bodies and rivers of blood, those streets utterly silent, nothing living remaining except her and Hatcher.</p><p>Much like this, really, Alice thought. Just her and Hatcher and the burned land.</p><p>Sitting in the ruins of what was probably magical fire, remembering the horrors committed by those men in the Old City, the belief of the existence of a good Magician seemed na�ve.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe power corrupts them,&#x201d; Alice said.</p><p>It was a frightening thought, one that made her suddenly reluctant to try any magic at all. She&#x2019;d spent years under the influence of drugs that made her think she was insane. She was only just learning who Alice was, what it was like to be her own self. She would rather use no magic at all than become someone unrecognizable.</p><p>&#x201c;Power corrupts who?&#x201d; Hatcher asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Hm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said, &#x2018;Maybe power corrupts them.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Magicians,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve yet to meet a decent one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Hatcher agreed. &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t mean they don&#x2019;t exist. In the story Cheshire told us, a good Magician saved the world from the Jabberwocky. At least for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d forgotten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to forget the good things,&#x201d; Hatcher said, and this statement seemed to set off another fit of brooding. He sat back in the ash and began idly drawing with the point of one of the many knives he carried.</p></p><h2>Why We Left An Anthology of American Women Expats</h2><p>Millions of Americans dream about living in Mexico - and millions more do!

The silent cat in Here Comes the Easter Cat has, and he&#x2019;s a bit put off by it. Communicating with a patient narrator through signage, facial expressions, and body language, the cat reveals that he plans to take over the Easter Bunny&#x2019;s job, roaring along on his motorcycle and delivering those Easter eggs himself (the narrator helpfully suggests that delivering hairballs might not be the way to go). Until, that is, he finds out that the exhausting egg-delivery schedule doesn&#x2019;t include time for his customary seven naps. Nevertheless, he manages to find a way to lend a helping hand and contribute to the holiday after all. Underwood (The Quiet Book, 2010) offers a hilarious give-and-take between feline and narrator that will work across a wide age range, as she imbues the cat with a prickly but eager personality, without having him utter a word. Rueda gets the joke, enhancing the fun with soft, warm tones; a great &#x201c;performance&#x201d; from the cat; and plenty of clever sight gags.

In elegant National Geographic style, hundreds of illustrations, maps, photographs, and artwork lay bare the bloody conflicts between Native Americans and European encroachment. <br><br>Five stirring chapters reveal the five major types of conflicts involving Native Americans: the wars of resistance, the wars between empires, the wars betweeen the tribes, the wars of conquest, and the wars of survival. Within each chapter, vivid accounts of each battle tell the gripping stories of the major players, the point of combustion, and the tragic results. <br><br>Readers will also get to know each tribe as distinct people, ranging from the so-called "civilized tribes" to the more aggressive warrior cultures. Rarely seen photographs and illustrations paint a vivid portrait of the time, featuring such notable figures as Kit Carson and Sitting Bull. <br><br>Filled with original National Geographic maps, informative timelines, and a complete index, this extraordinary book captures one of the most significant moments in American history.</p><p>ANTON TREUER, professor of Ojibwe language and culture at Minnesota's Bemidji State University, is editor of <i>Oshkaabewis Native Journal</i>, the world's sole journal of the Ojibwe language.

He has received awards from the National Science Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Bush Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, and more."The book is as visually impressive as it is dense with information. Historical photographs, artwork, maps, and timelines help the reader envision what life &#x2014; and war &#x2014; was like during these conflicts that seem so long ago." --<i>Cowboys &amp; Indians</i></p><h2>Bear and Wolf</h2><p><p>Bear and Wolf become unlikely companions one winter's evening when they discover each other out walking in the falling snow.<br>They're young and curious, slipping easily into friendship as they amble along together, seeing new details in the snowy forest. Together they spy an owl overhead, look deep into the frozen face of the lake, and contemplate the fish sleeping below the surface. Then it's time to say goodbye: for Bear to go home and hibernate with the family and for Wolf to run with the pack. Daniel Salmieri's debut as author/illustrator is a beautifully rendered story of friendship and the subtle rhythm of life when we are open to the world and to each other.</p></p><p>Daniel has this to say about his new book: This book was four years in the making and it&#x2019;s very close to my heart.

Over the course of twenty years and thousands of missions, he's fought desperately for his life, rescued hostages, killed and captured terrorist leaders, and seen his friends maimed and killed around him. <i>All Secure</i> is in part Tom's journey into a world so dark and dangerous that most Americans can't contemplate its existence. It recounts what it is like to be on the front lines with one of America's most highly trained warriors. As action-packed as any fiction thriller, <i>All Secure</i> is an insider's view of "The Unit." Tom is a legend even among other Tier One special operators. Yet the enemy that cost him three marriages, and ruined his health physically and psychologically, existed in his brain. It nearly led him to kill himself in 2014; but for the lifeline thrown to him by an extraordinary woman it might have ended there. Instead, they took on Satterly's most important mission-saving the lives of his brothers and sisters in arms who are killing themselves at a rate of more than twenty a day. Told through Satterly's firsthand experiences, it also weaves in the reasons-the bloodshed, the deaths, the intense moments of sheer terror, the survivor's guilt, depression, and substance abuse-for his career-long battle against the most insidious enemy of all: Post Traumatic Stress. With the help of his wife, he learned that by admitting his weaknesses and faults he sets an example for other combat veterans struggling to come home.</p><p><b>Tom Satterly</b> is a highly decorated combat veteran who was portrayed in the Oscar-winning 2001 film <i>Black Hawk Down</i>.

Sadly for his countless admirers, he hitched his own ride to the great beyond much too soon. Culled posthumously from Adams&#x2019;s fleet of beloved Macintosh computers, this selection of essays, articles, anecdotes, and stories offers a fascinating and intimate portrait of the multifaceted artist and absurdist wordsmith. <br><br>Join Adams on an excursion to climb Kilimanjaro . . . dressed in a rhino costume; peek into the private life of Genghis Khan&#x2014;warrior and world-class neurotic; root for the harried author&#x2019;s efforts to get a Hitchhiker movie off the ground in Hollywood; thrill to the further exploits of private eye Dirk Gently and two-headed alien Zaphod Beeblebrox. Though Douglas Adams is gone, he&#x2019;s left us something very special to remember him by. Without a doubt.<br><b><br>&#x201c;Worth reading and even cherishing, if only because it&#x2019;s the last we&#x2019;ll hear from the master of comic science fiction.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Star-Ledger </i></b></p><p>Adams authored five novels in the Guide, two Dirk Gently novels, and several other books.&#x201c;Above all, of course, Douglas Adams was a transcendent, multi-faceted, comic genius. What made Douglas&#x2019;s work unique, I think, were the wildly contradictory attributes he displayed in his writing. He seamlessly blended world-class intelligence&#x2014;and a daunting knowledge about an impossible variety of subjects (literature, computers, evolution, pop culture, genetics, and music, to name but a few)&#x2014;with transcendental silliness; technophobia with a lust for, and fascination with, every high-tech toy imaginable; deep cynicism about virtually everything with an effusively joyful spirit; and one of the quickest wits on the planet with a relentless perfectionism in pursuing his craft.&#x201d; &#x2014;From the Introduction by Christopher Cerf<br><br>&#x201c;The bottom drawer of recently deceased writers is often best left firmly locked and bolted. In the case of Douglas, I am sure you will agree, the bottom drawer (or in his case, the nested subfolders of his hard drive) has been triumphantly well worth the prising open. There are those who write from time to time and do it well, and then there are Writers. Douglas Adams, and it is pointless to attempt here an explanation or anatomisation, was born, grew up, and remained a Writer to his too-early dying day. <br>&#x201c;You are on the verge of entering the wise, provoking, benevolent, hilarious, and addictive world of Douglas Adams. Don&#x2019;t bolt it all whole&#x2014;as with Douglas&#x2019;s beloved Japanese food, what seems light and easy to assimilate is subtler and more nutritious by far than it might at first appear.&#x201d; &#x2014;Stephen Fry, author of <i>The Liar</i> and <i>Making History: A Novel</i></p><h2>Active Parenting: A Parent&#39;s Guide to Raising Happy and Successful Children</h2><p>Dr. Michael Popkin&#x2014;one of the nation's foremost experts on parent education&#x2014;explains positive discipline and communication techniques to help your family run more smoothly.

Lost in thought, or lost in translation, her head was down as she scribbled furiously in her notebook.</p><p>Ten pairs of eyes swung to her, to her pale face and long lashes, her thin white fingers clutching a pen. Then ten pairs of eyes swung back to the professor, who stood perfectly still and began to scowl. His scathing demeanor contrasted sharply with the overall symmetry of his features, his large, expressive eyes, and full mouth. He was ruggedly handsome, but in that moment bitterly severe, which rather ruined the overall pleasing effect of his appearance.</p><p>&#x201c;Ahem.&#x201d; A modest cough to her right caught the woman&#x2019;s attention. She glanced in surprise at the broad-shouldered man sitting next to her. He smiled and flicked his eyes to the front of the room, back to the professor.</p><p>She followed his gaze slowly, looking up into a pair of angry, peering blue eyes. She swallowed noisily.</p><p>&#x201c;I expect an answer to my question, Miss Mitchell. If you&#x2019;d care to join us.&#x201d; His voice was glacial, like his eyes.</p><p>The other graduate students shifted in their seats and stole furtive glances at one another. Their expressions said what crawled up his ass? But they said nothing. (For it is commonly known that graduate students are loath to confront their professors with respect to anything, let alone rude behavior.)</p><p>The young woman opened her mouth minutely and closed it, staring into those unblinking blue eyes, her own eyes wide like a frightened rabbit.</p><p>&#x201c;Is English your first language?&#x201d; he mocked her.</p><p>A raven-haired woman seated at his right hand tried to stifle a laugh, smothering it into an unconvincing cough. All eyes shifted back to the frightened rabbit, whose skin exploded into crimson as she ducked her head, finally escaping the professor&#x2019;s gaze.</p><p>&#x201c;Since Miss Mitchell seems to be carrying on a parallel seminar in a different language, perhaps someone else would be kind enough to answer my question?&#x201d;</p><p>The beauty to his right was only too eager. She turned to face him and beamed as she answered his question in great detail, making a show of herself by gesturing with her hands as she quoted Dante in his original Italian. When she had finished, she smiled acidly at the back of the room, then proceeded to gaze up at the professor and sigh. All that was lacking from her display was a quick leap to the floor and a rubbing of her back on his leg to show that she would be his pet forever. (Not that he would have appreciated the gesture.)</p><p>The professor frowned almost imperceptibly at no one in particular and turned his back to write on the board. The frightened rabbit blinked back tears as she continued scribbling, but mercifully she did not cry.</p><p>A few minutes later, as the professor droned on and on about the conflict between the Guelfs and the Ghibellines, a small square of folded paper appeared on top of the frightened rabbit&#x2019;s Italian dictionary. At first she didn&#x2019;t notice it, but once again, a soft ahem drew her attention to the good-looking man beside her. He smiled more widely this time, almost eagerly, and glanced down at the paper.</p><p>She saw it and blinked. Carefully watching the back of the professor as he drew endless circles around endless Italian words, she brought the paper to her lap where she quietly unfolded it.</p><p>Emerson is an ass.</p><p>No one would have noticed because no one was looking at her, except for the man at her side. As soon as she read those words, a different kind of flush appeared on her face, two pink clouds on the curve of her cheeks, and she smiled. Not enough to show teeth or what could be dimples or a laugh line or two, but a smile nonetheless.</p><p>She raised her large eyes to the man next to her and looked at him shyly. A wide, friendly grin spread across his face.</p><p>&#x201c;Something funny, Miss Mitchell?&#x201d;</p><p>Her brown eyes dilated in terror. Her new friend&#x2019;s smile quickly disappeared as he turned to look at the professor.</p><p>She knew better now than to look up at the professor&#x2019;s cold blue eyes. Instead, she put her head down and worried her plump lower lip between her teeth, back and forth and back and forth.</p><p>&#x201c;It was my fault, Professor. I was just asking what page we were on,&#x201d; the friendly man interceded on her behalf.</p><p>&#x201c;Hardly an appropriate question from a doctoral student, Paul. But since you asked, we began with the first canto. I trust you can find it without Miss Mitchell&#x2019;s help. Oh, and Miss Mitchell?&#x201d;</p><p>The frightened rabbit&#x2019;s pony tail trembled ever so slightly as she lifted her gaze.</p><p>&#x201c;See me in my office after class.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Dream of a Common Language: Poems 1974-1977</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Certain lines had become like incantations to me, words I&#x2019;d chanted to myself through sorrow and confusion&#x201d; &#x2015;Cheryl Strayed, <em>Wild</em></strong></p> &#x201c;<em>The Dream of a Common Language</em> explores the contours of a woman&#x2019;s heart and mind in language for everybody&#x2015;language whose plainness, laughter, questions and nobility everyone can respond to. . . .

All through the winter at Valley Forge, Molly watched and listened. Then in July, in the battle at Monmouth, she would show how much she had learned.

She's Mary (better known as Molly) Hays, and in 1777 she followed her husband to war and straight into the annals of American history. After surviving a winter at Valley Forge, Molly continued on with the remaining soldiers to the Battle of Monmouth (N.J.), fought on a sweltering June day. Molly spends the day fearlessly dodging cannon and musket fire to bring pitchers of water to heat-stricken soldiers and, later, manning the cannon left by her injured husband. Without sacrificing the dramatic momentum, the author also assesses the Americans' military tactics and training (or lack thereof) versus British expectations and mores (despite temperatures approaching 100 degrees, British soldiers wore fur hats and heavy wool suits). Rockwell finds opportunities for humor (in later life, it seems, the only fault her employers ever found with her was that she swore like a soldier) and for her own opinions (after Washington honors Molly, no soldier sneered at the thought of a woman being a sergeant in his army). Von Buhler (Little Girl in a Red Dress with Cat and Dog) works in a folk-art style, and flat perspectives, sturdy brushwork and light crackling effects give her paintings a colonial look. The type, unfortunately, can be difficult to read, set on a rustic, linen-like background a minor flaw in a memorable book.

What she doesn't realize is that the girls are about to set off a torrent of false accusations leading to the imprisonment and execution of countless innocent people. Susanna faces a painful choice. Should she keep quiet and let the witch-hunt panic continue, or should she "break charity" with the group--and risk having her own family members named as witches?<br> Reader's guide included.<br></p><p><p><b>ANN RINALDI</b> is an award-winning author best known for bringing history vividly to life. A self-made writer and newspaper columnist for twenty-one years, Ms. Rinaldi attributes her interest in history to her son, who enlisted her to take part in historical reenactments up and down the East Coast. She lives with her husband in central New Jersey.&nbsp;</p>Why, in 1692, did Salem execute 22 citizens accused by hysterical girls? Various causes--political, economic, scientific--have been advanced; Rinaldi makes a plausible case for a combination of these with the repression of a society with few amusements, late marriages, and young adults treated as children. As a wise old woman says here, ``...the spirit it took to tame this wilderness is so strong it would not bow to the authority of the Puritan covenant...They see this...as a failure of their vision. So they seek to lay blame.'' Rinaldi chooses as narrator Susanna English, ancestor of Nathaniel Hawthorne, fictionalizing her role of a fascinated, horrified observer who's told, early on, by ringleader Ann Putnam that the girls are deliberately seeking attention and power; Susanna keeps silent lest her own family be accused. The device works well as Susanna tries to negotiate with Ann; sees her parents accused despite her promise; falls in love with Magistrate Hathorne's son and persuades him of the ``witches' '' innocence; is taken in by Joseph Putnam, who is secretly encouraging opposition; and finally shares her knowledge, only to have her certainty challenged by prophecies that, amazingly, come true: ``...the line is thin between what is fanciful and what is real.'' Rinaldi's characterizations aren't subtle, but she has done her research well and fashioned an enthralling, authentic story that makes the results of compounding malicious lies with false confessions of terrified victims tragically believable. Fine historical fiction; Rinaldi at her best. Bibliography; excellent note sorting out fact and fiction. (Fiction. 11-17) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

While the US was trying to quell extremists, a highly secretive and compartmentalized wing of I.S.I., known as "Directorate S," was covertly training, arming, and seeking to legitimize the Taliban, in order to enlarge Pakistan's sphere of influence. After 9/11, when fifty-nine countries, led by the U. S., deployed troops or provided aid to Afghanistan in an effort to flush out the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the U.S. was set on an invisible slow-motion collision course with Pakistan.<br><br>Today we know that the war in Afghanistan would falter badly because of military hubris at the highest levels of the Pentagon, the drain on resources and provocation in the Muslim world caused by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and corruption. But more than anything, as Coll makes painfully clear, the war in Afghanistan was doomed because of the failure of the United States to apprehend the motivations and intentions of I.S.I.'s "Directorate S". This was a swirling and shadowy struggle of historic proportions, which endured over a decade and across both the Bush and Obama administrations, involving multiple secret intelligence agencies, a litany of incongruous strategies and tactics, and dozens of players, including some of the most prominent military and political figures. A sprawling American tragedy, the war was an open clash of arms but also a covert melee of ideas, secrets, and subterranean violence. <br><br>Coll excavates this grand battle, which took place away from the gaze of the American public. With unsurpassed expertise, original research, and attention to detail, he brings to life a narrative at once vast and intricate, local and global, propulsive and painstaking. <br><br>This is the definitive explanation of how America came to be so badly ensnared in an elaborate, factional, and seemingly interminable conflict in South Asia.

Just a bit here a bit there, that sort of thing. There have been a few books about the Allman Brothers over the year, and they all seem to tell one of two stories&#x2014;either we were all out there sowing our wild oats, or we were constantly surrounded by tragedy. None of them really got the feeling of the band right, and that was what I set out to do. </p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> What impact have your health struggles over the last few years had on the way you think about your life and history?</p> <p><strong> Allman:</strong> Well, as I said, I&#x2019;ve been working on this book for a while, but my health being what it has been over the last couple of years gave me an extra push to get the whole story down on paper. Last fall I was pretty sick, and I had this thought that it just wasn&#x2019;t my time yet. I&#x2019;ve still got more songs in me, more stories to tell. I guess this is one of &#x2018;em.</p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> Was it hard to make yourself think about the darker times in your life?</p> <p><strong> Allman:</strong> It was. I wanted to be as honest as I could, but at the same time, looking back like this was tough. Facing the past isn&#x2019;t easy. I threw down though, and didn&#x2019;t hold back. I didn&#x2019;t want anything colored up. </p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> What do you hope an Allman Brothers fan would learn about you from this book?</p> <p><strong>Allman:</strong> As I said before, for years, when people have talked about the band, they&#x2019;ve tended to focus on the tragedy or the insanity of our history. Make no mistake, those are in the book and they&#x2019;re very real. But a lot of people don&#x2019;t understand just how much fun we had&#x2014;especially in the beginning. I tried hard to include the good as well as the bad.</p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> Has spending this time looking back at the band's history given you a different appreciation for what the Allman Brothers have accomplished?</p> <p><strong> Allman:</strong> I&#x2019;m not so sure it&#x2019;s a different appreciation so much as just amazed and proud that we&#x2019;re still here today. In the book, I talk about when my brother first called me about being in the band he said he had these two drummers and two lead guitarists, and I remember thinking that sounded like a train wreck. But somehow it worked then and it&#x2019;s worked ever since. It&#x2019;s an incredible band, filled with incredible musicians, and I&#x2019;ve been very lucky to be a part of it. </p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> Do you think that your kids will learn about you from reading this story? How about your bandmates?</p> <p><strong>Allman:</strong> Sometimes when you&#x2019;re on the road with someone, it&#x2019;s easy to lose sight of just how far you&#x2019;ve come. I&#x2019;ve lived with these stories for a long time, but having them together, all in one place, is something else. Everyone always takes something different away from what they read. I can&#x2019;t say what people will learn, but my hope is they have some fun along the way. </p><p>As one of the greatest rock icons of all time, Gregg Allman has lived it all and then some. For almost fifty years, he's been creating some of the most recognizable songs in American rock, but never before has he paused to reflect on the long road he's traveled. Now, he tells the unflinching story of his life, laying bare the unvarnished truth about his wild ride that has spanned across the years. </p><p>The story begins simply: with Gregg and his older brother, Duane, growing up in the South, raising hell with their guitars, and drifting from one band to another. But all that changed when Duane and Gregg came together with four other men to forge something new&#x2014;a unique sound shaped by soul, rock, and blues and brimming with experimentation; a sound not just of a band, but of a family. </p><p>Bringing to life the carefree early days of the Allman Brothers Band, Gregg holds nothing back&#x2014;from run-ins with the law to meeting girls on the road, from jamming at the Fillmore East to experimenting with drugs. Along the way, he goes behind the scenes of some of greatest rock music ever recorded, without shying away from the infamous and painful deaths of his brother, Duane, and Allman Brothers bassist Berry Oakley. Speaking for the first time about the profound impact that his brother's death had on him, Gregg offers a tribute to Duane that only a younger brother could write, showing how, to this day, he still confronts the grief of losing his big brother, even as Duane continues to guide and inspire him. </p><p>Setting the record straight about the band's struggles in the face of death, Gregg shows how the decision to persevere came with a heavy price. While the rock and roll excesses of drugs, alcohol, and personality clashes led to a series of breakups that culminated with the band's permanent reunion in 1989, Gregg fought his own battle with substance abuse, going to rehab no less than eleven times and floating through a string of failed marriages, including his tabloid-frenzied relationship with Cher, before finally cleaning up once and for all. </p><p>Capturing the Allman Brothers' ongoing, triumphant resurgence as well as his own recent fight against hepatitis C and featuring over one hundred photos from throughout the band&#x2019;s history, Gregg presents a story as honest as it is fascinating, providing a glimpse inside one of the most beloved and notorious bands in the history of rock music and demonstrating how, through it all, the road goes on . . . forever. </p></p><h2>The Whites: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>By the co-writer of the HBO miniseries <i>The Night Of</i></b></p><p><b>Richard Price's<i> New York Times </i>bestseller,<i> The Whites</i>, is an electrifying tale of a New York City police detective under siege-by an unsolved murder, by his own dark past, and by a violent stalker seeking revenge.</b></p><p>Back in the run-and-gun days of the mid-1990s, when a young Billy Graves worked in the South Bronx as part of an aggressive anti-crime unit known as the Wild Geese, he made headlines by accidentally shooting a ten-year-old boy while struggling with an angel-dusted berserker on a crowded street. Branded as a loose cannon by his higher-ups, Billy spent years enduring one dead-end posting after another. Now in his early forties, he has somehow survived and become a sergeant in Manhattan Night Watch, a small team of detectives charged with responding to all post-midnight felonies from Wall Street to Harlem. Mostly, his unit acts as little more than a set-up crew for the incoming shift, but after years in police purgatory, Billy is content simply to do his job.</p><p>Then comes a call that changes everything: Night Watch is summoned to the four a.m. fatal slashing of a man in Penn Station, and this time Billy's investigation moves beyond the usual handoff to the day tour. And when he discovers that the victim was once a suspect in the unsolved murder of a twelve-year-old boy-a savage case with connections to the former members of the Wild Geese-the bad old days are back in Billy's life with a vengeance, tearing apart enduring friendships forged in the urban trenches and even threatening the safety of his family.</p><p>Razor-sharp and propulsively written, <i>The Whites</i> introduces Harry Brandt--a new master of American crime fiction.</p></p><p><b>Harry Brandt</b> is the pen name of acclaimed novelist Richard Price, whose novels-including <i>Clockers</i> and <i>Lush Life</i>-have won universal praise for their vividly etched portrayals of urban America.

Here's the real magic trick: The Whites is a serious book, with serious points to make, and at times it's almost unbearably sad. But it's also, often, very funny and deeply satisfying.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Seattle Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;An excellent novel.... Price has the novelistic equivalent of perfect pitch: he can create any variety of human character, put him in any situation and record his actions and speech with complete authenticity.... He manages to do it with compassion, with a sense that we're all bewildered, wounded creatures whose actions are a mystery to ourselves.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Denver Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;Richard Price is indeed a master... <i>The Whites</i> is full of the rich characters, spot-on dialogue, grim humor and distinctive insights that animate his other novels, including <i>Clockers</i> and <i>Lush Life</i>.... Price is a New York writer to the core; the raw power of this great city seeps into the lives of his characters as they struggle with grief, betrayal and shame.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Houston Chronicle</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Whites</i> grips a reader as firmly as any cable or pay-cable cop show you can think of - plus it offers the rich texture of Price's deeply informed writing.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Whites</i> is a crackling good crime novel, one that you will stay up all night to finish. Its themes of family, honesty and the price of loyalty are beautifully done.... The writing is superb, definitely a cut above most crime thrillers. Fans of <i>The Wire</i> should pick up <i>The Whites</i>; it's a great follow-up.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Auburn Citizen (Cayuga County)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Price enriches this story of a half-feral band of cops bonded by vengeance with depth, melancholy, and those famously keen eyes and ears.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;Extraordinary... A riveting crime tale thoroughly steeped in gritty cop irony, cop slang, cop attitudes and cop justice.... <i>The Whites</i> is especially good at capturing New York City's peculiar brand of violent crime.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Newsday</i></p><p>&#x201c;Seven years is too long for New Yorkers to wait for the next book from Richard Price but he's finally here again with a stunning NYPD novel...<i>The Whites</i> is grippingly immersive, its characters and the world they move through, indelible.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Daily News</i></p><p>&#x201c;A gripping, gritty, Greek tragedy of cops, killers, and the sometimes-blurry line between them... Price is one whale of a storyteller by any name... The author skillfully manipulates [his] multiple story lines for peak suspense, as his arresting characters careen toward a devastating final reckoning.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is going to be a strong contender for best crime novel of 2015.... With one-of-a-kind characters and settings so real you can smell them, Brandt plunges us into the chaos of domestic life, the true agony of a parent's grief, the cost of secrets kept and revealed. He does it all with indelible phrasing that captures both the black humor of the on-the-job cop and the give-and-take of longtime married couples. While the finely tuned story engine accelerates, it's supercharged with complications...In the end, <i>The Whites </i>isn't about cops and killers so much as it is about the damage we all carry [and] the sins we've all committed.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Fasten your seat belt... Old tragedies combine with fresh ones in Brandt's steely-jawed, carefully constructed procedural. Few crime novelists are as good at taut storytelling as Richard Price ... In the wake of rage and sorrow, ordinary people respond by going crazy and screwing up. In this far-from-ordinary novel, Price/Brandt explores the hows and whys.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Whites</i> is the crime novel of the year--grim, gutsy, and impossible to put down. I had to read the final 100 pages in a single sitting. I began being fascinated, and ended being deeply moved. Call him Price or Brandt, he knows everything about police life, and plenty about friendship: what your friends do for you...and what they sometimes do to you.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Stephen King</i></p><p>&#x201c;Whether you call it a crime novel or a mystery novel or a giraffe with polka dots is largely irrelevant--<i>The Whites</i> is, simply put, a great American novel.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dennis Lehane</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is high-octane literature, with the best of Richard Price and his souped-up pseudonym Harry Brandt. Price/Brandt gets to the heart of those stories that everyone else refuses to tell. <i>The Whites</i> manages to patrol New York and deepen our sense of the city and all its dark corners.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Colum McCann</i></p><p>&#x201c;Richard Price isn't fooling anybody with this Harry Brandt business; only he could have written <i>The Whites</i>. It has everything that makes his novels so wonderful--the dark humor, the intricate interleaving of character and plot, the deep research into the science of the streets, the moral gravity and the flawless, magical dialogue. Indeed the only credible thing to be said about Harry Brandt is that he has written one of Richard Price's best books yet.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Chabon</i></p></p><h2>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance</h2><p><p>God cares that we know who he is, and he longs for us to understand him better.

By virtually any assessment, it was the most important religious event of the twentieth century, with repercussions that reached far beyond the Catholic church. Remarkably enough, this is the first book, solidly based on official documentation, to give a brief, readable account of the council from the moment Pope John XXIII announced it on January 25, 1959, until its conclusion on December 8, 1965; and to locate the issues that emerge in this narrative in their contexts, large and small, historical and theological, thereby providing keys for grasping what the council hoped to accomplish. </p><p> <i>What Happened at Vatican II</i> captures the drama of the council, depicting the colorful characters involved and their clashes with one another. The book also offers a new set of interpretive categories for understanding the council&#x2019;s dynamics&#x2014;categories that move beyond the tired &#x201c;progressive&#x201d; and &#x201c;conservative&#x201d; labels. As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the calling of the council, this work reveals in a new way the spirit of Vatican II. A reliable, even-handed introduction to the council, the book is a critical resource for understanding the Catholic church today, including the pontificate of Benedict XVI. </p></p><p>John W. O&#x2019;Malley is University Professor at Georgetown University.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Novak The Second Vatican Council, which held 10-week sessions every autumn between 1962 and 1965, is almost universally regarded as the single most significant religious event of the 20th century. It was probably also the single largest meeting of active decision-makers in the history of the human race -- between 2,400 and 2,800 bishops, their theological advisers and other participants gathered each year in the huge nave of St. Peter's Cathedral. Its ceremonial splendor was irresistible to world television. Thousands of journalists descended on Rome to witness the intense, passionate arguments about a new opening of the church, a thaw in world affairs, a thorough reform of one of the world's oldest institutions. And the debate has never stopped. Over the last two or three decades, a huge argument has erupted among theologians, journalists and intellectuals about what "Vatican II" actually did. Conservatives tend to argue that the council took several false and damaging turns, leading unintentionally from the confident Roman Catholic Church of the 1950s to the empty churches (in Western Europe) today. As the great progressive Jesuit Gustave Weigel, who loved irony, once predicted during the council, swirling a splash of scotch in a plastic cup at a party: "All good things, given enough time, go badly." Progressives tend to argue that the council reaffirmed ancient traditions even as it made significant reforms: clearing the way for the Mass to be said in native languages, endorsing the search for heartfelt cooperation and doctrinal dialogue with other Christians and, above all, encouraging deeper self-understanding and warm relations with Jews. In other words, progressives say now (as some did then) that the council's essential purpose was conservative in nature, rooted in lessons from the pre-medieval church. They wanted, for instance, to resume the ancient tradition of speaking of the church as a "people" -- the "people of God" -- and of bishops and priests as "servants" of the people of God. They argued that celebrating Masses in vernacular languages and small, informal settings was more in keeping with the practices of the early church. Well, then, what was really new? Going back to the documentary record to answer this question, the Rev. John W. O'Malley set himself a Herculean task. The council's proceedings alone, without commentary, fill 32 hefty volumes. During the intervening years, hundreds of memoirs, insiders' amateur reportage (such as letters by bishops to their dioceses), diaries and memoranda have come to light. It is impressive how much of this material O'Malley, a Jesuit priest and professor of theology at Georgetown, has studied in the original languages and analyzed in his new book, What Happened at Vatican II. O'Malley also tells a good story. Though his main effort is to interpret what took place at this immensely complex event, he recounts the surprise announcement of the council by John XXIII ("good Pope John") in 1959. He details the three years of preparations and thoroughly chronicles each of the council's four sessions. For some readers, O'Malley's interpretive framework may be slow going, since he uses theological terms unfamiliar even to many Roman Catholics. But, in essence, he argues that the council was trying to do three things: bring new openness to Catholic thinking; update its teaching to face contemporary questions; and return to St. Augustine, St. John Chrysostom and other ancient sources richer than those of the post-Enlightenment era. His main point is that Vatican II differed in its way of thinking from every other doctrine-setting gathering in the church's history, from the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. to the First Vatican Council in 1869. His preferred word for this is "style," though sometimes he says "method," "approach" or "language." Vatican II was distinctive, he contends, in its attention to the liberty of the human person and to the connectedness of the human community. The new spirit was to affirm, not condemn; to be open, not closed; to focus on ideals to live by, not things forbidden. "Vatican II was unprecedented," he writes, "for the notice it took of changes in society at large and for its refusal to see them in globally negative terms as devolutions from an older and happier era." He says the council underscored the authority of bishops while, at the same time, trying to make them "less authoritarian." For bishops, priests and everybody in authority, it recommended the ideal of the servant-leader. It upheld the legitimacy of modern methods in the study of the Bible. It condemned anti-Semitism and discrimination "on the basis of race, color, condition in life, or religion." It called on Catholics to cooperate with people of all faiths, or no faith, in projects aimed at the common good. And it supplied "the impetus," O'Malley writes, "for later official dialogues of the Catholic Church with other churches." O'Malley is quite fair to the conservative minority of bishops at the council (who were startled to learn that they were the minority, after so many decades of precedence and power). He takes pains to show the reasonableness of their claims and their insight into the ill effects of some of the work of the council, including the departure of thousands of priests and nuns, a general confusion about what the Catholic Church is bound to teach, and the danger of a church so "open" it stands for nothing. Yet there is no doubt that O'Malley's heart lies with the progressive majority. This bias is also fair; after all, the progressives did win nearly all votes by impressive margins, often two-to-one. But many of today's progressives think that the church has lost its nerve since the council and has not gone far enough to adapt to the modern day, particularly in respect to the role of women. On these claims, O'Malley is silent. Reading the book, I remembered meeting O'Malley in 1963 at one of the U.S. bishops' daily press conferences after the council's morning events. A young scholar, he was working on a book on the Augustinian reformer Giles of Viterbo (1469-1532) under a prestigious fellowship at the American Academy in Rome. I was covering the council as a freelance journalist and later published a book on the Second Session (1963) under the title The Open Church. I report this only to make two points: Based on my experience of the same events, O'Malley does a truly superior job of reporting the crucial details and capturing the moods and passions of that time. Secondly, he has the advantage of many testimonies not known to us back then. These, too, he handles deftly. But to my thinking, O'Malley's approach is a little too lacking in irony, a little too blind to the council's negative effects and much too blind to errors committed by progressives in pursuit of noble goals: Translations of council documents (and important texts of the Scriptures) were so ideologically cast that they distorted the meaning. The abruptness of changes in the sacred liturgy unloosed a sense of instability and make-it-up-yourself theology. In some places, there followed a "me decade" of "cafeteria Catholics" who felt they could pick and choose from church doctrines. O'Malley mentions that Joseph Ratzinger, then in his 30s, was among the leading progressive theologians at the council. Meanwhile, he overlooks a long memo from Krakow's young Bishop Karol Wojtyla urging the council to focus on two questions -- What do we mean by "the human person"? And what is the nature of human "community"? -- which is exactly what the council did. O'Malley's study would have benefited from a section on Wojtyla and Ratzinger, who became the intellectually powerful Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Both were champions of the progressive cause during the council, while in later years also unmasking the deficiencies in the progressive view. Since they became the council's chief interpreters for the next four decades, a chapter on their critiques would have given What Happened At Vatican II a sharper focus. Nonetheless, O'Malley's book is a splendid introduction to a story of longed-for change, its good consequences and its sometimes depressing, unintended ones. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Through extensive new research that included records saved by the Monuments&nbsp;Men themselves&#x2014;Anders Rydell tells the untold story of Nazi book theft, as he himself joins the effort to return the stolen books. When the Nazi soldiers ransacked Europe&#x2019;s libraries and bookshops, large and small, the books they stole were not burned. Instead, the Nazis began to compile&nbsp;a library of their own that they could use to wage an intellectual war on literature and history. In this secret war, the libraries of Jews, Communists, Liberal politicians, LGBT activists, Catholics, Freemasons, and many other opposition groups were appropriated for Nazi research, and used as an intellectual weapon against their owners. But when the war was over, most of the books were never returned. Instead many found their way into the public library system, where they remain to this day.<br><br> Now, Rydell finds himself entrusted with one of these stolen volumes, setting out to return it to its rightful owner. It was passed to him by the small team of heroic librarians who have begun the monumental task of combing through Berlin&#x2019;s public libraries to identify the looted books and reunite them with the families of their original owners. For those who lost relatives in the Holocaust, these books are often the only remaining possession of their relatives they have ever held. And as Rydell travels to return the volume he was given, he shows just how much a single book can mean to those who own it.</p><p><b>Anders Rydell </b>is a journalist, editor, and author of nonfiction.

A Fire That Consumes the World</b><br><br> Berlin<br><br>"Where books are burned, in the end people will be burned too." -Heinrich Heine, 1820<br><br> These words are engraved on a rusty red metal plate sunk into the cobblestones of Bebelplatz in Berlin. Berlin's summer tourists wander past the square, situated between Brandenburger Tor and Museumsinsel, on their way to see one of the city's more grandiose sights. The location still holds symbolic tension. In one corner of the square stands an elderly woman with tousled white hair. She has wrapped herself in a big Israeli flag-the Star of David across her back. Another war has broken out in Gaza. Some thirty people have gathered to demonstrate against the anti-Semitic sentiments that, seventy years after the Second World War, are once more reawakening in Europe.<br><br> On the other side of the broad, fashionable thoroughfare of Unter den Linden, trestle tables have been put out in front of the gates of Humboldt University. For a few euros one can buy well-thumbed copies of books by Thomas Mann, Kurt Tucholsky, and Stefan Zweig-all authors whose works were thrown into the fire here in May 1933. In front of the tables is a row of cobblestone-size metal plates. Each plate bears a name: Max Bayer, Marion Beutler, Alice Victoria Berta, all of whom once studied at the university. After each name is a date, with a place-name that needs no further explanation: "Mauthausen 1941," "Auschwitz 1942," "Theresienstadt 1945."<br><br> Heinrich Heine's words, actually a line of dialogue from the play Almansor, have since the Second World War been seen as an insightful prophecy of what came to pass here, and the catastrophe that would follow. On May 10, 1933, in Bebelplatz, which at that time was known as Opernplatz, history's most famous ceremony of book burning was staged-an event that has remained a powerful symbol of totalitarian oppression, cultural barbarism, and the merciless ideological war waged by the Nazis. The flames of the book-burning pyre have also come to symbolize the intimate connection between cultural destruction and the Holocaust.<br><br> Earlier that same spring, the Nazis had assumed power in Germany using another fire-the Reichstag fire in February 1933-as a pretext. The Nazis claimed it was the work of Communists and that Germany was threatened by a "Bolshevik plot," and set in motion the first extensive wave of terror, arresting Communists, Social Democrats, Jews, and others in political opposition. These accusations were fueled by the Nazi Party newspaper, the V&#x161;lkischer Beobachter, which had been stirring and agitating for years against Jewish, Bolshevik, pacifist, and cosmopolitan literature, setting the stage for the Nazis' ascendance.<br><br> The Nazis had been sabotaging cultural events since before 1933-everything from "displeasing" film screenings to exhibitions of so-called degenerate art came under attack. In October 1930, Thomas Mann, who had won the Nobel Prize the previous year, attacked the prevailing mood in an open reading held at the Beethoven Hall in Berlin. Joseph Goebbels, tipped off about what was in the offing, had sent twenty Brownshirts from the party's SA storm troops to the reading, all in black tie to blend in with the audience, a group that included some right-wing intellectuals. Mann's speech was met with applause from some sections of the audience, and heckling from the saboteurs. Eventually the atmosphere grew so inflamed that Mann was forced to leave the premises by the back entrance.<br><br> Threats were even more widespread. The Mann family and writers such as Arnold Zweig and Theodor Plievier had been receiving a constant stream of threatening telephone calls and letters. The homes of writers were vandalized with graffiti. And selected writers were subjected to individual monitoring by SA patrols that waited outside their houses and followed them wherever they went.<br><br> Lists of objectionable literature were produced. In August 1932, the V&#x161;lkischer Beobachter published a blacklist of writers who should be banned once the party assumed power. Early that same year, a declaration had been published in the same newspaper, supported by the signatures of forty-two German professors, demanding that German literature should be protected against "cultural Bolshevism." In the winter of 1933, when the Nazis took power, the focus attack against objectionable literature shifted away from the street and into the machinery of state. In February 1933, President Paul von Hindenburg signed a law "for the protection of people and state," which imposed restrictions on printed publications-further amendments in the spring of the same year imposed more controls on freedom of expression. The first casualties were Communist and Social Democrat newspapers and publishers. Hermann G&#x161;ring was charged with leading the battle against so-called dirty literature: Marxist, Jewish, and pornographic books.<br><br> It was this attack on literature that led up to the book burnings in May-but in fact the initiative did not come from the Nazi Party, but rather from the Deutsche Studentenschaft-an umbrella organization of German student federations. Several of these student federations had more or less openly been supporting the Nazis since the 1920s. It was not the first time in the interwar period that German right-wing conservative students had made book pyres. In 1922 hundreds of students gathered at the Tempelhof airfield in Berlin to burn "dirty literature," and in 1920 students in Hamburg burned a copy of the Treaty of Versailles, the terms of surrender that Germany had been forced to sign after the First World War.<br><br> The Nazi Party's attack on literature fed into attacks already being carried out by groups of conservative, right-wing students. For these student groups, book burnings were a German tradition of defiance and resistance going back to the days of Martin Luther and the Reformation. In April 1933 the Deutsche Studentenschaft announced an action against "un-German literature," casting Adolf Hitler as a new Luther. To evoke the Ninety-five Theses with which Luther began the Reformation, the student federation published its own "theses" in the V&#x161;lkischer Beobachter-twelve theses "Wider den undeutschen Geist!" (Against the un-German Spirit).<br><br> The students argued that language held the true soul of a people and that German literature for this reason had to be "purified" and liberated from foreign influence. They stated that the Jew was the worst enemy of the German language: "A Jew can only think in a Jewish way. If he writes in German he is lying. The German who writes in German but thinks in an un-German way is a traitor." The students demanded that all "Jewish literature" should be published in Hebrew and "the un-German spirit eradicated from public libraries." German universities, according to the students, should be "strongholds for the traditions of the German people."<br><br> Their proclamation was the beginning of a national action to clean out "un-German" literature. Student associations subordinated to Deutsche Studentenschaft at German universities and formed "war committees" to organize coordinated book burnings all over Germany. The book burnings were to be manifested as celebratory events, and the committees were exhorted to market their events, sign up speakers, collect wood for the fires, and seek support from other student federations and their local Nazi leadership. Those who opposed this work, especially teachers, were threatened. The war committees also put up posters with slogans such as "Today the writers, tomorrow the professors."<br><br> But the primary task of the war committees was to collect "unclean" literature for burning. Students were ordered to begin the cleanup in their own private libraries, later expanding to public libraries and local bookshops, many of whom cooperated willingly. In the spring of 1933 a more general blacklist of books and authors also began to be compiled. Wolfgang Herrmann, a librarian who had involved himself with right-wing extremist student groups as early as the 1920s, had been working for several years on a list of literature "worthy of being burned." The first draft only listed 12 names, but this was soon expanded to 131 writers, subdivided into various categories. They included Communists, ranging from Trotsky and Lenin to Bertolt Brecht; pacifists like Erich Maria Remarque; Jewish intellectuals like Walter Benjamin; and many other literary and intellectual figures who had gained prominence during the Weimar Republic.<br><br> Quite apart from critics of nationalism, historians were also blacklisted when their perspective on history did not coincide with that of the Nazis, particularly in books on subjects including the First World War, the Soviet Union, and the Weimar Republic. There were also some thinkers whose global view was utterly rejected by the Nazis, such as Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein. Both were attacked on the basis of advancing "Jewish science."<br><br> In addition to "cleaning" their own libraries, the students asked public libraries and local bookshops to make a contribution by giving up their own holdings of "dirty literature." In many instances, university registrars and teachers collaborated with the students to clean out the school libraries.<br><br> But the war committees also applied more violent methods, aided by local police and storm troopers from the SA, to get their hands on books. A few days before the book burnings, in early May, the students attacked lending libraries and Communist book dealers. The former were especially hated by conservative forces and were described by Wolfgang Herrmann as "literary brothels" spreading dirty, Jewish, decadent literature among decent, ordinary people. Libraries had become extremely popular since the First World War. On account of the economic depression and inflation in Germany during the interwar years, fewer and fewer Germans could afford to buy their own books. Traditional libraries could not provide for the great demand for books, which led to more than fifteen thousand small lending libraries being set up. These libraries provided a low-cost book-lending service, and bought large volumes of the best sellers of the time such as the works of Thomas Mann. These "people's libraries" were easy victims for the students, while the SA troops also raided private libraries. One much-publicized raid was carried out against an apartment building in Berlin owned by Schutzverband deutscher Schriftsteller, an organization working to protect German writers actively opposing censorship and other forms of state intervention in literature. Some five hundred of the association's members living in the building had their apartments searched and vandalized. Suspicious books were confiscated or destroyed on the scene, and writers caught with "socialist" literature were detained.<br><br> The most notorious raid was carried out a matter of days before the book burnings, when about a hundred students attacked Institut f&#x178;r Sexualwissenschaft (Institute of Sexual Studies), situated in Tiergarten in Berlin. The institute, founded by the medical doctors Magnus Hirschfeld and Arthur Kronfeld, conducted groundbreaking research into sexuality and also worked to promote the rights of women, homosexuals, and transsexuals. For three hours the students went berserk in the building, pouring paint over carpets, breaking windows, covering the walls in graffiti, and destroying paintings, porcelain, and other household goods. They took away books, the institute's archive, and a large collection of photographs along with a bust of the founder Magnus Hirschfeld.<br><br> Already in 1932, many Jews and Communists, who could see where the political winds were blowing, had begun to clear out their private libraries and destroy photographs, address books, letters, and diaries. The Communists had sent out warnings to their members that if they were carrying "dangerous" documents they had to be prepared to swallow them. In this way there were also thousands of lesser book pyres, where people set fire to their own libraries in stoves, fireplaces, and backyards. They would soon find out that it was easier said than done: burning books is a time-consuming activity. Instead, many people chose to dump their libraries in forests, rivers, or abandoned streets-others posted them anonymously to nonexistent addresses.<br><br> After 1933, a large number of German authors chose exile, of their own accord or under duress. Apart from Thomas Mann, they included his brother Heinrich Mann, Bertolt Brecht, Alfred D&#x161;blin, Anna Seghers, Erich Maria Remarque, and hundreds of others. By 1939 some two thousand writers and poets had felt compelled to leave Nazi Germany and Austria. Many of them would never return. But a large number also chose to stay. Some writers who were not expressly political went into what has later been referred to as "interior exile." They stayed in their German sphere, or "Heimat," but made the decision not to publish. Alternatively, they released books that were accepted by the board of censors: children's books, poetry, and historical novels. Others were prevented from publishing their works, because membership in the National Chamber of Literature, a division of Joseph Goebbels's Ministry of Public Education and Propaganda, was required before one could be published.<br><br> But there was also another group of writers that joined ranks with the regime. In October 1933 a series of German newspapers published a proclamation signed by eighty-eight German writers and poets under the headline Gel&#x161;bnis treuester Gefolgschaft, a sort of oath of allegiance. The proclamation was in direct support of Germany's recent decision to leave the League of Nations. Among the signatories were authors such as Walter Bloem, Hanns Johst, and Agnes Miegel, now mainly forgotten, as their rise and fall is so intimately associated with the regime to which they swore their loyalty.<br><br> At the time, great rewards lay in store for authors who embraced National Socialism. Positions previously closed to them in Germany's most respected literary academies, foundations, and associations began to open. They also laid claim to new groups of readers, once the regime assumed control of the nation's foremost book clubs. In 1933 the Nazi-run book club Buchergilde Gutenberg had 25,000 members, whereas a few years later its membership had increased to 330,000. By relying on book clubs like this, the regime was able to efficiently distribute everything from Goethe and Schiller to nationalist, conservative, and Nazi writers to millions of readers.<br><br> The propaganda ministry instigated a literary and political drive that has never been equaled in German history-and probably not in modern history either. The ministry awarded more than fifty literary prizes annually.<br><br> Over the course of the 1930s, Goebbels's propaganda ministry took complete control of the German book industry, including some 2,500 publishers and 16,000 book dealers and secondhand bookshops. One of the first measures was to weed out "Jewish influence" in the world of books by gradually excluding Jews from academies, literary associations, writers' professional bodies, publishers, book dealers, and printers. Jewish publishers, printers, and book dealers were "Aryanized"-transferred to Aryan owners. Some of these Jewish publishing houses were among the largest in the industry. For instance, Julius Springer was the world's largest publisher in the field of scientific publishing. It was a step-by-step process that continued throughout the 1930s. Initially the takeovers of Jewish companies and the exclusion of Jews were cautiously handled, to avoid companies losing value or the disruption of international relations. Jewish owners were simply persuaded to sell, and if they refused...</p><h2>The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism</h2><p>...a major work for our times. --Irving Kristol, The Public Interest</p><p>This book is a personal but not and egocentric accout of how the author has come to reject the socialist teachings which have encumbered the political philosophy of theologians for whom he has clearly a profound respect.</p><h2>Leadership</h2><p><p>"To some historians Professor Burns is a fine political scientist.

When she later discovers that Darcy has involved himself in the troubled relationship between his friend Bingley and her beloved sister Jane, she is determined to dislike him more than ever. In the sparkling comedy of manners that follows, Jane Austen shows the folly of judging by first impressions and superbly evokes the friendships, gossip and snobberies of provincial middle-class life. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print".

I mean, there are heights involved here, and you&#x2019;re not as young as you used to be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am <i>not</i> thinking of doing it myself, but I&#x2019;m certainly in good enough shape to,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;What kind of heights are we talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The roof of a six-story town house, shooting through a conveniently located skylight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is no such thing as a conveniently located skylight, if you&#x2019;re the one doing the climbing,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d need someone . . . spry,&#x201d; Eggers said, &#x201c;and the term hardly applies to the cops and ex-cops you mingle with.&#x201d;</p><p>At that moment, as if to make Eggers&#x2019;s point, Stone&#x2019;s former partner from his NYPD days, Dino Bacchetti, walked through the front door and headed for Stone&#x2019;s table.</p><p>&#x201c;If you see what I mean,&#x201d; Eggers said.</p><p>Stone held up a hand, stopping Dino in his tracks, then a finger, turning him toward the bar.</p><p>&#x201c;I get your point,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see who I can come up with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have a lot of time,&#x201d; Eggers said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s at nine o&#x2019;clock tomorrow night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s at nine o&#x2019;clock tomorrow night?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The assignation.

Nighty-night.&#x201d; He slapped Dino on the back as he passed the bar on his way to the door.</p><p>Dino came over, licking Scotch off his hand, where Eggers had spilled it. He flopped into a chair. &#x201c;So what was that about?&#x201d; he asked, pointing his chin at Eggers&#x2019;s disappearing back.</p><p>&#x201c;Dirty work,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Dino patted the rest of the spilled Scotch off his hand with a cocktail napkin. &#x201c;Is there any other kind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure there is, and they give me plenty of it,&#x201d; Stone said defensively.</p><p>&#x201c;How dirty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just slightly grubby; I don&#x2019;t have to kill anybody.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And who are you going to get to do it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Teddy&#x2019;s dead, so I guess I&#x2019;d better call Bob Cantor,&#x201d; Stone said, digging out his cell phone and switching it on.</p><p>&#x201c;Bob&#x2019;s your man, as well as your uncle,&#x201d; Dino observed.</p><p>Stone dialed the number and got a recording. He left a message, then dialed Cantor&#x2019;s cell phone.</p><p>It was answered instantly. &#x201c;Speak to me!&#x201d; Cantor&#x2019;s voice shouted over a babble of voices and steel-band music.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Stone.

You wouldn&#x2019;t believe the women.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d believe them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What d&#x2019;ya need, that you would interrupt a man&#x2019;s drinking?&#x201d;</p><p>Stone looked around and cupped a hand over the cell phone. &#x201c;I need a second-story man who&#x2019;s good with a camera.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You running a badger game?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Close, but not quite.

He&#x2019;s young and bold and agile, and he&#x2019;s a pretty good photographer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The light may not be very good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It never is in those situations, is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p><p>Cantor gave Stone the number, and he wrote it on a cocktail napkin. &#x201c;Tell him I sent you and not to screw it up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does he make a habit of screwing up?&#x201d; Stone asked. But Cantor had punched off and returned to his pi�a coladas.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard that,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;but I didn&#x2019;t hear it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Stone said, punching in the number Cantor had given him. The phone rang five times before it was picked up.</p><p>&#x201c;What!&#x201d; a young man&#x2019;s voice said, panting.</p><p>&#x201c;Herbie Fisher?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who wants to know? Jesus, can&#x2019;t a guy get laid anymore?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My name is Stone Barrington. Your uncle Bob said to call you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gimme your number, I got something to finish here.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone gave him the number, and he hung up.</p><p>&#x201c;I think I interrupted him,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;In the saddle?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what it sounded like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;These kids!&#x201d; Dino said, laughing. &#x201c;Nobody would ever have caught you or me doing that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; Stone agreed. Then he looked toward the door and froze. &#x201c;Look over your shoulder and tell me if I&#x2019;m seeing what I think I&#x2019;m seeing,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Dino looked over his shoulder. &#x201c;Carpenter!&#x201d;</p><p>She was standing there in a beautiful cashmere coat that set off her dark brown hair, looking around, looking lost; she hadn&#x2019;t seen him. Stone grabbed Michael, the headwaiter, as he passed. &#x201c;The lady at the door,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Go over there and say, &#x2018;Miss Carpenter? Mr. Barrington is expecting you.&#x2019; Then bring her here.&#x201d;</p><p>Michael nodded and went to his work. Stone watched her face; no sign of surprise. Carpenter had never given much away. Michael led her back toward the table, and Stone and Dino stood up.</p><p>&#x201c;What took you so long?&#x201d; Stone said, embracing her and kissing her on the cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;I came as fast as I could,&#x201d; she said, her British accent smooth and creamy. &#x201c;Dino, how are you?&#x201d; She hugged him.</p><p>&#x201c;Better now,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>Stone took her coat, hung it up, and held a chair for her, then he sat down and waved Michael over again. &#x201c;What would you like to drink, Carpenter?&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t know her first name, nor her last name, for that matter. Carpenter was a handle, a moniker, a code name. They had met in London the year before, when he had gotten himself into a mess that required the assistance of British intelligence. Dino had been there, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Bourbon, please,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;no ice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You get that, Michael?&#x201d;</p><p>Michael nodded and went away.</p><p>&#x201c;Since when does a limey girl drink bourbon?&#x201d; Dino asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Since Stone extolled its virtues,&#x201d; she replied. A glass was set before her, and she sipped appreciatively.</p><p>&#x201c;And what brings you to New York?&#x201d; Stone asked. &#x201c;Besides me, I mean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said drolly, &#x201c;you were the most important consideration, of course, but there is a little job I have to do with an agency of your government that will require every waking moment that I can tear myself away from your presence.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see that there are not many of those moments,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Dare I ask which agency of my government?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The FBI,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes, they would be the folks who are roughly analogous to your own outfit, wouldn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; she said coolly.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Stone, she&#x2019;s not going to tell you anything,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>Elaine came back and pulled up a chair.</p><p>&#x201c;Elaine Kaufman,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;let me introduce . . .&#x201d; He waited for Carpenter to fill in the blank.</p><p>&#x201c;Felicity,&#x201d; Carpenter said, offering her hand to Elaine and shooting Stone an amused glance.</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes,&#x201d; Carpenter replied.</p><p>Stone&#x2019;s cell phone rang.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>Stone stood up. &#x201c;Excuse me for a moment,&#x201d; he said to Carpenter. He walked toward the kitchen and turned into the empty dining room that Elaine used for parties and overflow. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is Herbie Fisher. You called?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I spoke to your uncle Bob a few minutes ago, and he recommended you for a job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of job?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It involves a camera.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m up for photography,&#x201d; Herbie said. &#x201c;Tell me more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The job&#x2019;s tomorrow evening, so clear your schedule. Come to my office tomorrow morning at ten.&#x201d; Stone gave him the address. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the professional entrance of the house, lower level.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it pay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll talk to you tomorrow morning.&#x201d; Stone hung up and went back to his table. Elaine had moved on to somebody else&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201c;Late date?&#x201d; Carpenter asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Business,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, business.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How long are you in town for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A few days, unless I can think of a reason to stretch my stay.&#x201d;</p><p>Dino stood up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave you two to work on some reasons.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good night, Dino,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I hope I&#x2019;ll see you again while I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Count on it,&#x201d; Dino said, then he left.</p><p>&#x201c;Sweet man,&#x201d; Carpenter said.</p><p>&#x201c;If you say so. Felicity, huh? I like it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just as well; I&#x2019;m not going to change it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you had dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had a business dinner earlier.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you staying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With friends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where, with friends?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the East Forties.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very near me. Will you come to my house for a nightcap?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d;</p><p>They got into their coats and, outside, Stone started to hail a cab.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I have a car, courtesy of my firm.&#x201d; She nodded toward a black Lincoln idling at the curb.</p><p>&#x201c;All the better,&#x201d; Stone said, opening the door for her. He gave the driver his address.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s in Turtle Bay,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;You know Turtle Bay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can read a map and a guidebook, I know all about it. Does your house open onto the common garden?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, it does.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;ll show me the garden tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; Stone replied, though he wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what she meant.</p><p>&#x201c;How does one afford a house of one&#x2019;s own, what with property prices the way they are in New York these days?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Easy. One has a great-aunt who dies and wills him the house. Then one works one&#x2019;s ass off renovating it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to see it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to wait, we&#x2019;re here.&#x201d; He opened the door, and she slid across the seat. She leaned back into the car. &#x201c;You can go,&#x201d; she said to the driver.</p><p>Stone liked the sound of that. He led her up the steps, unlocked the front door, and hung their coats in the front hall closet. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you had any friends in New York,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Business friends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. And I suppose their front hall closet has a selection of cloaks and daggers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Stone switched on some lights from the master panel in the foyer.</p><p>Carpenter walked into the living room. &#x201c;This is very handsome,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Did you choose the furniture, or did you have a designer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Most of the furniture came with the house.

Hornby lives outside of London in the English countryside with her partner and top recipe taster Ross.</p>Starred Review. UK food writer Hornby's voluminous compendium of culinary classics deserves to make the short list for novice cooks interested in learning how to make the basics from scratch. Over the course of the book's 400-plus pages, Hornby guides readers through everyday favorites like Huevos Rancheros, Lasagna, Paella, chicken wings and blue cheese dip, and apple pie. Though there are the occasional minor variations on classic recipes (a bay leaf is added to milk simmering for mac and cheese), Hornby's by-the-book approach to everyday eating is a terrific resource for those with a taste for tradition. Each dish is accompanied by step-by-step photos, ensuring those cooking along with the author will be able to pull off Cinnamon Rolls, a Chocolate Truffle Cake, or Shrimp Pad Thai with confidence. While thoughtful, this approach can veer into the extreme (assembling an antipasti plate or making a BLT?), but it's a vital component of creating more complicated fare like Eggs Benedict or Roast Beef &amp; Yorkshire Puddings (she is British, after all). More experienced cooks are likely to find the dishes rather elementary, but those curious about how to prepare a Margherita pizza or beef stew will find this a terrific guide.</p><h2>Mystic Christianity</h2><p>Strange rumors reached the ears of the people of Jerusalem and the surrounding country.

Edison Prize in 1956Grade 1-3?First released in book form in 1946, this story has since appeared in numerous editions. It tells of a small angel who simply can't get with the program no matter how hard he tries until an understanding elder realizes that he is homesick and is able to retrieve a box of his most treasured possessions from "back home." When it comes time for Jesus to be born on Earth, the Littlest Angel gives his precious box to the Baby, but he is worried that God will think his gift too humble. However, God is pleased indeed, and transforms the box into the Star of Bethlehem. The writing style is rather ornate and full of grandiose words and phrases, but some children will love to hear it read aloud. The oil paintings are muted and full of texture, and not at all sentimental. The celestial choir is multicultural, and the Littlest Angel has red shorts peeking out of his robe. Paul Micich's version (Ideals, 1991) has a glossier "greeting-card" look. This reincarnation of the story will be as popular as its predecessors.?EM<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Knitting Answer Book: Solutions to Every Problem You&#39;ll Ever Face; Answers to Every Question You&#39;ll Ever Ask</h2><p>Every avid knitter has faced this dilemma: deep into a project at midnight, just trying to finish one more row, and, then . . . oh no, a dropped stitch three rows back!

Strap yourself in.&#x201d; &#x2014;Slash<br> <br>&#x201c;Rocking Joe Perry &#x2018;rocks&#x2019; again!&#x201d; &#x2014;Jimmy Page<br><br>Before the platinum records or the Super Bowl half-time show or the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Joe Perry was a boy growing up in small-town Massachusetts. He idolized Jacques Cousteau and built his own diving rig that he used to explore a local lake. He dreamed of becoming a marine biologist. But Perry&#x2019;s neighbors had teenage sons, and those sons had electric guitars, and the noise he heard when they started playing would change his life. <br> <br>The guitar became his passion, an object of lust, an outlet for his restlessness and his rebellious soul. That passion quickly blossomed into an obsession, and he got a band together. One night after a performance he met a brash young musician named Steven Tyler; before long, Aerosmith was born. What happened over the next forty-five years has become the stuff of legend: the knockdown, drag-out, band-splintering fights; the drugs, the booze, the rehab; the packed arenas and timeless hits; the reconciliations and the comebacks. <br> <br><i>Rocks</i> is an unusually searching memoir of a life that spans from the top of the world to the bottom of the barrel&#x2014;several times. It is a study of endurance and brotherhood, with Perry providing remarkable candor about Tyler, as well as new insights into their powerful but troubled relationship. It is an insider&#x2019;s portrait of the rock and roll family, featuring everyone from Jimmy Page to Alice Cooper, Bette Midler to Chuck Berry, John Belushi to Al Hirschfeld. It takes us behind the scenes at unbelievable moments such as Joe and Steven&#x2019;s appearance in the movie of <i>Sgt. Pepper&#x2019;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> (they act out the murders of Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees). <br> <br>Full of humor, insight, and brutal honesty about life in and out of one of the biggest bands in the world, <i>Rocks</i> is the ultimate rock-and-roll epic. In Perry&#x2019;s own words, it tells the whole story: "the loner&#x2019;s story, the band&#x2019;s story, the recovery story, the cult story, the love story, the success story, the failure story, the rebirth story, the re-destruction story, and the post-destructive rebirth story."</p><p>Lead guitarist Joe Perry and singer Steven Tyler wrote the majority of the songs that form the backbone of Aerosmith&#x2019;s catalogue. In 2013, they were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.<br><br>David Ritz is a songwriter who has collaborated with stars like Janet Jackson and Marvin Gaye, as well as a renowned ghostwriter who has authored more than fifty books for some of the biggest stars in music: Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, Lenny Kravitz, Joe Perry, Smokey Robinson, Don Rickles, and Willie Nelson, to name a few.

I&#x2019;m swimming through an ocean of startling clarity. I&#x2019;m seeing a thousand varieties of fish; I&#x2019;m feeling like a fish myself, aware that at any moment a bigger fish might swim my way&#x2014;a shark or a barracuda. The thought is more exhilarating than frightening. I&#x2019;m not scared of the possibility of danger. I almost welcome the encounter. I welcome surprise. Nature is nothing but surprise, a world of water whose vastness allows me to disappear into pure beauty.<br> <br>The lure of the woods is its primitive beauty. My dream life in the woods has me lost in a grove of ancient trees. If I keep walking long enough I&#x2019;ll find my way out, but I&#x2019;m not sure I want out. Being lost in the wilds has a certain comfort. There is no destination, no home. I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s around the bend&#x2014;a wolf, a wildcat, a venomous snake. I like not knowing. I like the dense undergrowth, the sharp smells of the forest, the songs of the birds, the ever-changing weather, the dark clouds, the quickening of my heartbeat as I suddenly realize that I and I alone am responsible for my survival. For the rest of my life I will stare into the unknown.<br> <br>In the water and the woods I face danger and discovery. In my real life, as a boy born on September 10, 1950, and raised in the small, quiet town of Hopedale, Massachusetts, I keep going back to the water and the woods. That&#x2019;s where I seek anonymity. It&#x2019;s where I can disappear into wordless, endless wonder.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not saying that I&#x2019;m able to completely disappear from the emotional ups and downs that characterize every childhood. I&#x2019;m saying that I want to. My earliest memories all involve being drawn deep into nature, where I welcome, rather than fear, getting lost. I welcome the mysteries that lurk at the bottom of the sea and live inside the dark forest of night.<br> <br>My parents were good and honorable people. They cared for their two children&#x2014;my younger sister, Anne, and myself&#x2014;with loving concern. My mother, Mary, was a graduate of Boston University with a master&#x2019;s degree. She taught physical education in the public schools. Her mind was both curious and brilliant. She was always reading about everything from the earth&#x2019;s chakras to the metaphysics of quantum theory to John Steinbeck&#x2019;s Travels with Charley. She wore her hair short and exuded great confidence. As a strong and proud working mom of the 1950s, she was a woman of the future&#x2014;a liberated woman decades before the movement began.<br> <br>My father, Tony, was equally upstanding. He had gone to Kent State and graduated from Boston&#x2019;s Northeastern University with a major in accounting. He had grown up in Lowell, Massachusetts, where his dad, a Portuguese immigrant from the island of Madeira off the coast of Morocco, worked in the factories and later owned a funky little grocery store. My dad was born in Lowell and when he was two the family moved back to Madeira where my dad spent his childhood before moving back to the States. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Forces at the end of World War II, Dad graduated from college and began working as an accountant, taking his first steps toward self-reinvention. The family name&#x2014;Pereira&#x2014;was shortened to Perry by his father. And rather than stay in Lowell, Dad moved to Hopedale, some thirty miles outside Boston, where the American dream had been set out in the form of suburban perfection. Hopedale was where my father entered the upper middle class.<br> <br>Founded in 1842, Hopedale was one of the country&#x2019;s first utopian communities. It began as a picture-perfect Norman Rockwell village of industrious dreams. In the 1850s the Draper Corporation, manufacturer of power looms for the textile industry, took over the town. In the 1950s my dad went to work for Draper as a cost accountant. He and Mom bought a duplex in Bancroft Park and rented out the other side.<br> <br>Mom&#x2019;s parents, the Ursillos, hailed from Naples, Italy, and would have loved to see their daughter enter a nunnery. She rejected most of their old-world notions about womanhood, but she accepted their Catholicism&#x2014;at least to the point of attending Sunday mass and making sure that her husband and children did the same.<br> <br>In our household there were few if any remnants of my parents&#x2019; Italian and Portuguese backgrounds. Only English was spoken. No philosophy but American pragmatism was practiced. Do what works. Adapt to reality. Improve your circumstances by applying yourself. I was raised inside the solid ethos of the Eisenhower 1950s. My mother&#x2019;s child-raising bible was Dr. Spock&#x2019;s Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care. The Perrys were all about common sense. Mom taught generations of children the benefits of exercise. Because of his common sense and sterling reputation, Dad was elected town treasurer. Mary and Tony were a well-respected couple. At home, they spoke to one another fondly. They were affectionate; they hugged; they kissed; they were girlfriend and boyfriend. Together, they comprised a formidable tennis doubles team.<br> <br>I see them in their whites, out on the court during a fine New England afternoon in May, whacking the ball with studied determination. I am not part of their game but, standing close by, I feel their confidence.<br> <br>I see them flying high in the cloudless sky in a seaplane that my father is piloting. I am not with them, but from the ground below, I feel their exhilaration as Dad buzzes the local baseball field to get a look at the score. The town officials chastise him for flying too low. He&#x2019;s contrite but I know he doesn&#x2019;t regret his joyride. Straitlaced accountants don&#x2019;t break laws, even minor ones, but I&#x2019;m glad to see that my dad, whose laces are always supertight, has some sense of rebellion.<br> <br>He was the first guy in Hopedale to buy a Volkswagen Bug. Later he bought a BMW before anyone had heard of BMWs. The color, I remember well, was bright orange.<br> <br>I also remember Dad talking about his buddies and World War II like it had just ended. He told stories about being a waist gunner on a B-17, the heavy-duty bomber, during the last months of the war. I pictured him standing at an open window on the side of a plane tearing through the sky at two hundred miles an hour, thirty-two thousand feet above the ground. The wind&#x2019;s coming at an outside temperature of -32�. Dad&#x2019;s face is covered by an oxygen mask and his chest protected only by a sheepskin jacket as he fires away at enemy aircraft. He realizes that such missions end with a 40 to 50 percent fatality rate. Yet he does what he has to do, a nineteen-year-old with balls of steel.<br> <br>As a little boy, I would study a tattered black-and-white photo of his crew, amazed that my dad was once so young. He and his fellow soldiers looked into the camera with easy gazes. There was no fear in their eyes. They seemed relaxed about their mission, which, day after day, brought them to death&#x2019;s door.<br> <br>I saw my father as a man of quiet courage. His goal for his family was simple&#x2014;a better life. Postwar America was all about optimism and economic mobility. The war had been won and prosperity was at hand. But prosperity had to be earned through skills forged in discipline. It took discipline to become a professional accountant. It took hard work for a woman in the 1940s to graduate from college. My parents lived disciplined lives. They were neither doting nor overly affectionate with their children, but they were dutiful and always present. Dinner was served on time. Bills were paid on time. We didn&#x2019;t live beyond our means. We didn&#x2019;t live on borrowed money. Education was valued. Education was seen as the key to greater prosperity.<br> <br>My education became the first and greatest stumbling block, another reason why I longed to lose myself in the water and the woods. Like millions of other kids, I had a learning disability&#x2014;attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&#x2014;that was neither understood nor treated. Reading was the only subject at which I excelled. I would much rather be reading James Fenimore Cooper than dealing with participles in French.<br> <br>My poor school performance was puzzling because my parents saw that I possessed intelligence and curiosity. Marine biology became a passion. When I asked them to drive me to Boston to hear lectures by Jacques Cousteau, my first hero, they were happy to do so. They took me to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod, a paradise for a kid in love with water. I was obsessed with learning from those men who explored the deep. I wanted to go deep. I was told that if I kept up my grades I could come back one summer and intern at Woods Hole.<br> <br>That never happened.<br> <br>My grades were below average. That became the great mystery of my childhood: Why was I having such difficulty at school? I was deeply frustrated. I wanted to present my parents with good grades. I sensed their ambition for themselves and for me&#x2014;and I wanted to realize those ambitions. I wanted to please them. The fact that I scored high on IQ tests only made things worse. I didn&#x2019;t understand why I wasn&#x2019;t doing better, and neither did they. They hired tutors but the tutors didn&#x2019;t help. I read things three or four times without retaining a word. I was always told to try and focus, but that never worked. At school, I felt like I was living under a cloud.<br> <br>That cloud extended to another area of my childhood: my dad&#x2019;s health. The chronology is vague and the memories blurred, but the specter of cancer entered my childhood at an early date. Somewhere in my young years my father went to the hospital. He was gone for an extended time. The man who returned had a dark beard, and I didn&#x2019;t recognize him. When I realized the stranger was my father, I burst into tears. The ugly scar across his back where they had reached in to remove his cancerous kidney frightened me even more.<br> <br>Relief from my own struggles at school came from a dreamlike body of water set inside the woodsy landscape of western New Hampshire. Three hours north of Hopedale, Sunapee is a pure glacial lake, a natural wonder of luminous clarity and pristine beauty. The first time I faced the lake, my heart sang. I was a quiet kid, often shy, and not given to outward bursts of enthusiasm. But Lake Sunapee broke down my reserve and had me jumping for joy. To my young eyes, it was an undiscovered world to enter and explore. From the outside it was magnificent, but from the inside&#x2014;diving under and skiing over its mountain-clear waters&#x2014;it became even more miraculous. Sunapee became a refuge, a friend, a different and exciting second home, a place that turned my mundane world magical. Its magic turned my life around. Even now, writing from afar, I long to see it sparkling under the summer sun or frozen solid under a white winter moon. Eight miles long and a couple of miles wide, the lake is dotted with eight islands and a shoreline that extends some seventy miles. There are small peninsulas and little lake fingers and sandy beaches wherever you look. The outlying forest is dense with vegetation and animal life. On a night in fall, breathing in the crisp, cool air, you look up into a sky crowded with a hundred thousand stars. In the morning, with the rising sun, you see a hundred thousand trees whose leaves are shimmering gold.<br> <br>Coming to Sunapee as a child, I fell deeply and permanently in love. My love for the water and the woods never diminished. Later in life, I moved away, but I kept coming back. I couldn&#x2019;t stay away from the place where, for the first and only time, everything made sense. Everything was right&#x2014;the sky, the lake, the forest, the sense of calm, the feeling of natural order.<br> <br>My parents began talking about buying lakefront property to build a cabin. They proceeded with the usual Perry MO: Save until the money is there; do not buy on credit; do not live above your means. After carefully surveying the region, they chose a prime piece of property&#x2014;it featured a hundred feet of lake frontage, in an undeveloped area. It provided one of the best views on the lake. A foundation was poured. A shell was built. Because my grandfather also did some building, my dad used his tools to do a lot of the work himself. My parents were young and athletic and skilled at manual labor. My mom did the painting. It became a family project, and within a year or two we were living in the cabin. Because there was no water or heat, it served us only during the warm months. We closed it up during winter. But eventually we winterized it&#x2014;a complicated operation that required running a pipe thirty feet out to the lake. The pipe had to be buried four feet down, below the frost line. I helped Dad dig the ditch with a pick and shovel, a job I usually hated, but I loved this one. I loved anything that would enable us to spend more time at Sunapee and work alongside my dad.<br> <br>As a resort area, Lake Sunapee had a rich history. There had been many ups and downs. When I was old enough to hang out, I saw the remnants of the forties and fifties. Those were the old hotels that were bustling during and just after World War II&#x2014;the days when Benny Goodman&#x2019;s and Glenn Miller&#x2019;s big bands stopped off to play on their way from New York to Montreal. When I was a kid, those same resorts, in various stages of decay, were still around. There was a decrepit theater, an old skating rink, a variety of old buildings rotting away. At the same time, there was a feeling of excitement from a new generation of kids who hung out at the harbor. The hot spot was an ice cream parlor/burger joint packed wall-to-wall with teenagers, their hot rods parked outside. Some old-money kids cruised up in their parents&#x2019; classic Chris-Craft speedboats. The yacht club was still up and running and a focal point for Sunapee&#x2019;s high society.<br> <br>My mother, an instructor for the Red Cross, taught me to swim. I took to it immediately. It makes sense that water meant security, because Mom taught water safety and had certified most of the kids in our cove as open-water swimmers.<br> <br>Water-ski shows in the harbor attracted big crowds. In trying to imitate the fancy tricks, most times I&#x2019;d wind up on my ass with a nose full of water, but I would keep trying until I mastered it. I was able to pull off most every trick in the water-ski manual&#x2014;from two skis to one ski to no skis at all. Driving the boat as her son tried mastering these tricks, my mother demonstrated limitless patience. I saw water as the source of endless amusement. And then came that dark day when water became linked with death.<br> <br>Friends and I were watching a water-ski show filled with the kind of danger and daring that I loved. It was a weekend when my relatives had come to the lake for a family barbecue. The proceedings were interrupted by a loudspeaker announcement: &#x201c;There has been an accident. A doctor is needed. Will a doctor please come to the dock immediately?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t think much of it. No one in the show had suffered a fall. The accident must have happened somewhere else on the lake. After the show had ended, my sister and I went back to our cabin, where we saw a police car in our driveway. The atmosphere was quiet, cold. A crowd of people was down by the waterfront talking to my family&#x2014;my parents plus cousins, aunts, and uncles. Dad quickly took Anne and me aside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kids,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;something awful has happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to ask. I didn&#x2019;t want to know. I stayed silent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your grandfather had an accident. He fell from his boat. We&#x2019;re afraid he&#x2019;s drowned.&#x201d;<br> <br>I remember asking the ridiculous question &#x201c;Is he all right?&#x201d; and feeling stupid afterward.

In the abundant records extant from these hearings, we experience the passions and concerns of ordinary people, often in their own words, more than three centuries after the emotion-charged events that brought them to court. Rapaport is a lawyer and historian who, by drawing on these court records, has created an award-winning column for New England Ancestors, the journal of the New England Historic Genealogical Society.

She is the author of seven books, including <i>The Mythic Tarot Workbook, Understanding the Tarot, Mastering the Tarot</i> and <i>Beginner's Guide to Tarot.</i><p> Introduction </p><p> This Workbook is intended to help Tarot students to deepen and widen their knowledge of the cards. I have had the good fortune to teach many Beginners' Workshops in Tarot which often ended with the cry: 'Now that we know what the cards <i>mean</i> how do we <i>work</i> with them?' In answer to that cry I set up Advanced Workshops. This Workbook is intended to act as a substitute for work shops. It is a sequel to <i>The Mythic Tarot,</i> which provided background history for all forms of Tarot cards, and outlined the basic meanings in a mythological, psychological and divinatory sense. </p><p> Although the Workbook is designed with <i>The Mythic Tarot</i> cards in mind, it can be used equally well with any other Tarot deck with which readers may be more familiar. The mythic pictorial imagery differs from many traditional Tarot decks but the divinatory meanings of the cards remain the same. The exercises are therefore appropriate for use with any Tarot deck. The Workbook aims to help students to structure and increase their knowledge in using the Tarot more effectively in practice. So it concentrates on the two aspects essential to all effective Tarot readings: that readers come to know themselves better via the Tarot, and that they in turn use their knowledge to help interpreting it for other people. </p><p> The Workbook comprises four parts. The first deals with the Major Arcana and concentrates on developing a richer and deeper relationship with the mysterious twenty-two Major Trumps. Guided fantasy and therapeutic colouring exercises are demonstrated in order to enable you to establish a closer relationship with the images. Particular attention is paid to the cards' uses and their value in the search for self-awareness. The second section focuses on the Court Cards and their correlation with Astrology, in particular with zodiacal sun signs through the Knight, Queen and King. The third section offers a closer understanding of the everyday meanings of the Minor Arcana, and space is provided for exercises to help fix their message clearly in the reader's understanding. The fourth section looks at various aspects of Tarot reading, layouts and use of the Tarot therapeutically; whether professionally, for friends, or for personal self-improvement. </p><p> It is important to remember that your proficiency in Tarot readings will be directly linked with the amount of effort put into study. For this reason I have devised various exercises to help you to develop a greater understanding of interpretation. Methodical performance of these exercises will produce a deeper appreciation of the breadth and depth of this fascinating subject. The exercises are structured and set out in a form that encourages you to fill in the blanks and note pages. Keeping a conscientious record of your work over weeks, months and years will develop a continuity in study, as well as charting your progress. In attempting the colouring exercises it is a good idea to record the date and your mood at the time, so that in weeks or months ahead you can look back over your notes and see how your views have changed and developed. Similarly, keeping a record of the readings you perform on the blanks provided, will act as a reminder of the outcome of your own interpretations and those made for friends or clients. I recommend that you open a file to contain photocopies of the blank spreads to facilitate this. </p><p> The style and manner of your approach to reading Tarot will naturally be unique to you. Within the generally accepted principles and symbolism of Tarot, a spread of cards is capable of interpretation in many ways, depending upon one's personal experience. I can offer an insight into my own approach to interpretation, but it will not necessarily be the same as your own. Tarot reading is a deeply personal act which can only develop with time and effort and practice.</p></p><h2>Gotrek &amp; Felix: The Second Omnibus (Warhammer)</h2><p>With his companion Felix, Gotrek the dwarf trollslayer roams the wild, dark places of the Warhammer world, seeking a glorious death in battle.

Or that PMS may have evolved to get rid of boyfriends with unfit sperm? Behind the "fickle" differences in what women find sexy about men, or what they like to wear, there's a hidden adaptive intelligence that has been shaped over eons. <br><br>In this provocative and paradigm-shattering book, Martie Haselton, the world's leading researcher on sexuality and the ovulation cycle, takes a deep, revealing look at the biological processes that so profoundly influence our behavior and sets forth a radical new understanding of women's bodies, minds, and sexual relationships, one that embraces hormonal cycles as adaptive solutions to genuine biological challenges. At the core of Hasleton's new Darwinian feminism is her remarkable discovery that humans, like our animal cousins, possess a special phase of sexuality, called estrus, which comes with a host of physiological and behavioral changes.<br><br>Rigorously researched, entertaining, and empowering, <i>Hormonal</i> offers women deep new insights into their bodies, brains, relationships, and affairs, allowing them to make better-informed choices about sex, marriage, friendship, contraception, and more. Above all, <i>Hormonal</i> is a clarion call to appreciate and embrace the genius of female biology. <br></p><p><b>Martie Haselton, PhD, </b>is the world's leading researcher on how ovulatory cycles influence women's sexuality.

Finally, a feminist with the courage to discuss women not as victims of their hormones but as elegantly built captains of their minds and lives. In this solidly scientific yet graceful book, Haselton shows how women's evolved hormonal activities help them shop for Mr. Right, compete with rivals, and raise healthy, productive young. <i>Hormonal</i> also informs on vital current issues-from bearing babies in middle age to taking hormone supplements in later life. This is the real story of women. It's an honest, accurate, important, and captivating read.&#x2015;<b><i>Helen Fisher, author of <i>The First Sex</i> and <i>Why We Love </i><br></i></b><br><br>"Martie Haselton has written the book many of us have been waiting for: a genuinely feminist exploration of what we know about how our hormones shape the way we feel, love, and behave. I thought I knew a lot about the biology she covers, but Haselton gave me a much deeper understanding of our sexual and reproductive lives. Whether you're wanting to understand your hormonal teenager, your life as a college student, your desire to protect your babies, your sexual peaks and valleys, or how we women just keep developing sexually into our sixties and on, this is the book for you. With lively prose and healthy skepticism, Haselton takes us a fascinating tour of our hormones."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Alice Dreger, author of <i>Galileo's Middle Finger</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>Hormonal</i> is a brilliant book.

Required reading for all who seek to understand the hidden forces of hormones. It shows how all women are linked to a long and unbroken chain of wise ancestral mothers, and how modern women can control their own mating destinies."&#x2015;<b><i>David M.

Every night I was so worried that meant she was going to die and I'd never see her again.<br><br>When people tell me to lighten up, that things aren't so bad, it makes me feel much worse. They must think I actually like being this way.<br><br><i>Views from parents:</i><br><br>It is very hard to see my daughter in pain and so scared. Before we got treatment, I felt there was nothing I could do to alleviate her pain. I felt so helpless, being the parent and not knowing what to do; that was the worst feeling.<br><br>Teachers think I'm nuts because my daughter is picture perfect at school. She's the model student--never a problem. But at home she totally falls apart, her anxiety is so intense, it makes normal life impossible for us. I wish they could see her at home so they would understand what I'm talking about.<br>Anxiety in Children: Too Much of a Good Thing?<br><i>"Don't run into the street, stop climbing on that, careful, that will break." </i>These are words that most parents have to say over and over again, but that most parents of anxious children will probably never have to utter. In fact, parents may find themselves kept in check by their worrying child--<i>"Did you lock the door? Is the gas tank full? Did you send in the permission slip?"</i> Though it can often be confusing or frustrating to parents that their child must feel every wrinkle in the day and race ahead to prepare for every eventuality, we must understand that anxious kids are just doing what their brain tells them to do. Anxious children are highly cautious, overcorrecting for the possibility of danger. In fact their wiring has them seeing danger when it's not there. Born with a mind that casts tall, scary shadows on ordinary things, they spend their days enduring great distress over things that their peers don't even notice. Anxious kids may recognize that they are different, but they don't know why, assuming that this is just how they are.<br><br>Because we don't see things as anxious kids do, we may be impatient, judgmental, and perhaps even overprotective, but not necessarily effective. The more that we can understand about what our children are seeing and feeling when they are anxious, distortions and all, the more we can empathize. If we don't empathize, we lose our audience. They won't stick around for the lesson, because they think you don't understand the problem in the first place.<br><br>Children's fears are a source of concern, distress, and even embarrassment for parents. When it's their child who is hiding in the corner at the birthday party, in tears at the school play, or unable to go on the school camping trip, parents are stuck. Rather than getting mobilized to help, parents often feel an urgent need to find the "off" button for those fears to simply stop. What fuels that concern further are two thoughts: first, "this shouldn't be happening, my child shouldn't be afraid," and second, "I don't know how to fix it." It is this two-part punch that fear delivers to parents, immobilizing their helpfulness response and leaving both them and their kids at a loss--or more often in a "you should," "I can't" contest of wills.<br><br>This chapter introduces the concept of fear--how it functions as an essential safeguard for survival. Fears and worries can help children put the brakes on in situations with which they are unfamiliar. Rather than hurling yourself into a swimming pool when you don't know how to swim, a good dose of fearful "what if?" can keep a healthy degree of caution in the picture until that is no longer needed. In addition, this chapter explores the differences between normal fears and anxieties, and takes an inside look at how anxiety shapes a child's experience. Finally, it presents different models for how fears and anxieties develop, exploring the influence of such factors as genetics, temperament, and experience. The bottom line is that children come by fears honestly. The more parents understand that fear is nothing for them to fear, the more they can be instrumental in helping kids out of these glitches.<br>Fear: A Normal and Necessary Part of Life<br>Fear is a necessary function for our survival. Because our natural inclination is toward growth and development, we would not survive as a species if it were not for our ability to hold back and appraise and avoid danger. It is a protective mechanism and a normal part of development.<br><br>The focus of anxiety changes for children over time as their world broadens and they encounter new experiences that they have not yet mastered. Babies are afraid of a loss of support and loud noises, toddlers who are learning to run away themselves are afraid of separation and things bigger than themselves, and young children are afraid of the results of their emerging imagination, especially at night--monsters, burglars, and other bad guys. Adolescents fear social scrutiny and begin to look beyond themselves to the world community and such abstract issues of safety as war, and success in the future. Fear can be considered the emotional response that occurs in the interim between confronting a new situation and actually mastering it. In the same way that adults may be fearful of a new piece of technology until we have figured out how it works--and may entertain unrealistic scenarios of blowing up the computer by pushing the wrong button--kids' fears and anxieties are fueled by an active imagination trying to piece together an explanation for how the world works. A little information goes a long way. A four-year-old at the aquarium is afraid when she hears that she's going to see the sharks because she is old enough to learn that sharks are dangerous, but not old enough to understand that she will watch safely from outside the tank. An eight-year-old is beginning to understand about germs and disease but can't yet grasp how unlikely it would be to get sick just from engaging in normal activities. Temporary fears are part of life.<br><br>Anxiety is the tense emotional state that occurs when you can't predict the outcome of a situation or guarantee that it will be the desired one. Even in the best circumstances children experience some worry. Anxiety becomes a disorder when a child automatically exaggerates risks and underestimates the ability to cope with a given situation. Anxiety is debilitating to children, causing not only chronic fatigue and other physical complaints, but also decreased academic functioning and even school attendance, and strained peer and family relations.<br>Typical Developmental Sequence of Fears in Children<br><i>Infancy:</i> In response to a growing ability to differentiate familiar faces (parents) from unfamiliar faces, stranger anxiety (clinging and crying when a stranger approaches) develops around 7 to 9 months and typically resolves by end of first year.<br><br><i>Early Childhood:</i> As a healthy attachment to parents grows, separation anxiety (crying, sadness, fear of desertion upon separation) emerges around one year of age and improves over the next three years, resolving in most children by the end of kindergarten. As children's worlds expand, they may fear new and unfamiliar situations and real and imagined dangers from such things as big dogs, spiders, or monsters.<br><br><i>Elementary School:</i> With access to new information, children begin to fear real-world dangers--fire, burglars, storms, illness, drugs. With experience, they learn that these risks can exist as remote rather than imminent dangers.<br><br><i>Middle School: </i>Growing importance of social status leads to social comparisons and worries about social acceptance. Concerns about academic and athletic performance and social-group identification are normal.<br><br><i>High School:</i> Teenagers continue to be focused on social acceptance, but with a greater concern for finding a group that reflects their chosen identities. Concerns about the larger world, moral issues, and their future success are common.<br>Who Is the Anxious Child?<br>Anxiety has many faces. Some children appear visibly stressed, others keep their anxiety under cover and worry silently, still others are angry-anxious kids, reacting to their limitations with frustration. Demographically speaking, prevalence rates range from 5.7 to 17 percent of all children.1 Rates of anxiety disorders tend to increase slightly with age; however, most studies of anxiety disorders draw from a sample of children over seven years old, so the prevalence of anxiety disorders in very young children is unclear. Girls tend to be diagnosed with anxiety disorders more often than boys, though more boys may be brought to treatment, as the outward signs of anxious behavior--crying, shying away, overt distress--may be less socially acceptable in boys than girls. The consensus across numerous studies of anxious children is that the majority of them have more than one anxiety disorder occurring at the same time, which is referred to as "co morbid." If left untreated, anxiety symptoms become more disabling over time, and the course is considered to be chronic with fluctuations across the lifespan.<br><br>Though children with anxiety disorders are as impaired as children with disruptive disorders, they will often stay below the radar of the adults around them and go undiagnosed because their symptoms don't interfere in the classroom, but rather are internalized. The seriousness of anxiety disorders is often downplayed by the public--anxious children may be seen as simply needing to lighten up.<br><br>The invisibility of the symptoms makes them no less detrimental to the child. Anxious children may have fewer friends because of social fears, or because their free time is consumed by worry or rituals. They may spend inordinate amounts of time preparing for an event, trying to fall asleep at night, getting their homework just right, getting reassurance about their safety. They may not go out for a sport to avoid the risk of being humiliated. They may not go to friends' houses, not consider college because of panic or separation concerns. At home, family life may lose its sense of spontaneity and fun, as participating in ordinary events may be too anxiety-provoking.<br><br>From morning till night, with little exception, worried kids are bombarded with a myriad of "what ifs." With so much on their minds, we might marvel at how well anxious kids are able to hold it together.<br>Causes and Correlates of Anxiety<br>All parents spend time worrying and wondering about what caused their child's anxiety. Many entertain the dark question of whether they somehow brought this anxiety on their child--either by their own behavior or by genetic transmission. The second issue is easier to address--as we'll see below, there is a strong genetic link for anxiety disorders, but as we know that genes do unto the next generation as has been done to the previous one, we have no choice in the matter. The genetic recipe folds the bad into the good. It does help to understand the physiological nature of anxiety, as it helps parents and kids maintain a no-fault approach to the problem. We would never blame our children for their asthma or diabetes--or blame ourselves for passing it on, and so it should be with anxiety disorders.<br><br>What we'll see in this section is that like any aspect of a child, anxiety is the result of the knitting together of multiple influences. No one factor accounts for all. "Bad parenting" can't cause these problems, and good parenting alone can't fix the problem. If there are changes you want to make, your child's difficulties may spur you on to turn over a new leaf, but understand that this will only help the process; it will not be the reason why there was trouble in the first place. In fact, what look like "strange parenting practices"--accommodating a child's fear--are often an <i>effect</i> of having an anxious child, not a cause.<br><br>Nature? Nurture? Our understanding of the causes of anxiety in children comes from an appreciation of the interaction of multiple factors. These include (1) genetics and brain physiology, (2) temperament, (3) parenting style, and (4) environmental factors including traumatic events. All of these inputs have both sensitizing as well as buffering influences.<br>Genetics: Born to Be Anxious?<br>It is commonly said that evolution selects for anxious genes--and when considering the survival of the species it's not hard to see why. Too many false positives are better than one fatal oversight, but when you scale that down to the individual child's narrow shoulders it doesn't make it comfortable for the owners of those anxious genes.<br><br>Genetics researchers have found some support for the genetic transmission of anxiety. Children of anxious parents are seven times more likely to develop an anxiety disorder than children of non-anxious parents.2 Although the evidence for familial transmission is strongest for panic disorder, genetics explains about 30 to 40 percent of all transmission. Thus, while genetics make a significant contribution, the majority of children with anxious parents do not develop an anxiety disorder. Genetics determine your overall vulnerability or susceptibility to anxiety. Children may be born more sensitive and reactive, with lower distress tolerance, but other factors intervene to tip the scales. There are likely multiple genes that contribute to a child's anxiety disorder, not one identifiable gene for anxiety. The genes affect how different cells in the body's alarm system operate--the sensitivities, reaction times, and absorption rates. We now take a behind-the-scenes look at that system, and at some of the areas that have been identified as central to our processing and experience of fear, threat, and anxiety.<br>The Anatomy of the Brain: Wired for Worry<br>At the center of the brain's defense system--let's call it the "anxiety works"--an almond-shaped cluster of cells, the amygdala, operates within the limbic system, the system responsible for processing emotional experiences. The amygdala is a lifesaver--pulling us back from the curb to avoid a speeding car--fast, but not always accurate--alarming us over a stick that looks like a snake. Thus, it may also be the culprit when it comes to anxiety disorders, signaling us to jump to dire conclusions when there is nothing to fear. The amygdala is like a first responder--it quickly assesses the emotional significance of cues and activates nearly every system in the body to survive a perceived threat, whether that means to fight or run for your life. When the perceived danger has passed, the prefrontal cortex, which acts like brakes in the fear circuit, signals the amygdala that it's time to downshift so that the body can then return to its baseline or steady state. Evolution selects for cautious genes by favoring easy starts to the fear response, but not easy stops.<br><br>One area of ongoing anxiety research concerns the role of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, or brain messenger chemical. When danger and all-clear messages are not transmitting efficiently, excessive anticipation and prolonged distress may result. The Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs, are the medications that are most prescribed for anxiety disorders. These are discussed further in Chapter 3.<br>Temperament and Behavioral Inhibition<br>"Temperament," according to Ralph Waldo Emerson, "is the iron wire upon which the beads [of life] are strung." Many anxious children appear to be sensitized to change and risk<i> from birth</i> and as a result have a curbed approach to exploration. This predisposition is a blueprint for prediction children's needs and experiences in any given situation. Their extremely cautious style is no one...</p><h2>The Sermon on the Mount: A Foundation for Understanding</h2><p>This commentary is designated as a critical-historical commentary which deliberately contrasts the more familiar historical-critical commentary which often connotes a school of thought, whereas, the historical-critical sets out to examine the Scriptures &#34;purely historically&#34; without recognizing that the controlling influence of a 19th century positivistic approach to history had polluted their &#34;pure history&#34; from the outset which resulted in an overly skeptical treatment of the Scriptures. Thus, this commentary offers a critical exegesis in that it makes use of the literary and historical critical tools including text, source, form, tradition, redaction, and structural criticism.</p><p></p><h2>Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig (The Life and Death of Lou Gerhig)</h2><p>Draws on hundreds of new interviews and previously unpublished letters to present a comprehensive account of the life of the Hall of Fame ballplayer whose career was cut short by the disease now named for him, in a portrait that shares background details about his rivalry with Babe Ruth, the onset of his illness, and the final years of his life. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>Lou Gehrig started his professional baseball career at a time when players began to be seen as national celebrities. Though this suited charismatic men such as Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio, Gehrig avoided the spotlight and preferred to speak with his bat. Best known for playing in 2,130 consecutive games as well as his courage in battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a disease that now bears his name), the Iron Horse that emerges from this book is surprisingly na�ve and insecure. He would cry in the clubhouse after disappointing performances, was painfully shy around women (much to the amusement of some of his teammates), and particularly devoted to his German-immigrant mother all his life. Even after earning the league MVP award he still feared the Yankees would let him go. Against the advice of Ruth and others, he refused to negotiate aggressively and so earned less than he deserved for many seasons. Honest, humble, and notoriously frugal, his only vices were chewing gum and the occasional cigarette. And despite becoming one of the finest first basemen of all time, Jonathan Eig shows how Gehrig never seemed to conquer his self-doubt, only to manage it better. <p> Jonathan Eig's <i>Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig</i> offers a fascinating and well-rounded portrait of Gehrig, from his dugout rituals and historic games to his relationships with his mother, wife, coaches, and teammates. His complex friendship with Ruth, who was the polar opposite to Gehrig in nearly every respect, is given particularly vivid attention. Take this revealing description of how the two men began a barnstorming tour together following their 1927 World Series victory: "Ruth tipped the call girls and sent them on their way. Gehrig kissed his mother goodbye." Eig also shares some previously unknown details regarding his consecutive games streak and how he dealt with ALS during the final years of his life. Rich in anecdotes and based on hundreds of interviews and 200 pages of recently discovered letters, the book effectively shows why the Iron Horse remains an American icon to this day. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>Jonathan Eig </b>is a former writer and editor for the Chicago bureau of <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>and the former executive editor of <i>Chicago </i>magazine.

After earning a law degree in 1906, he worked for most of his adult life at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute in Prague. Only a small portion of Kafka's writings were published during his lifetime. He left instructions for his friend and literary executor Max Brod to destroy all of his unpublished work after his death, instructions Brod famously ignored.<i>[April 1920]<br>Meran-�Untermais, Pension Ottoburg</i><br><br>Dear Frau Milena<br><br>The rain which has been going on for two days and one night has just now stopped, of course probably only temporarily, but nonetheless an event worth celebrating, which I am doing by writing to you. Incidentally the rain itself was bearable; after all, it is a foreign country here, admittedly only slightly foreign, but it does the heart good. If my impression was correct (evidently the memory of one single meeting, brief and half-�silent, is not to be exhausted), you were also enjoying Vienna as a foreign city, although later circumstances may have diminished this enjoyment, but do you also enjoy foreignness for its own sake? (Which might be a bad sign by the way, a sign that such enjoyment should not exist.)<br><br>I&#x2019;m living quite well here, the mortal body could hardly stand more care, the balcony outside my room is sunk into a garden, overgrown and covered with blooming bushes (the vegetation here is strange; in weather cold enough to make the puddles freeze in Prague, blossoms are slowly unfolding before my balcony), moreover this garden receives full sun (or full cloud, as it has for al- most a week)&#x2014;�lizards and birds, unlikely couples, come visit me: I would very much like to share Meran with you, recently you wrote about not being able to breathe, that image and its meaning are very close to one another and here both would find a little relief.<br><br>With cordial greetings,<br>F Kafka<br><br>***<br><i>[April 1920]<br>Meran-�Untermais, Pension Ottoburg</i><br><br>Dear Frau Milena<br><br>I wrote you a note from Prague and then from Meran. I have not received any answer. It so happens the notes did not require a particularly prompt reply and if your silence is nothing more than a sign of relative well-�being, which often expresses itself in an aversion to writing, then I am completely satisfied. However, it is also possible&#x2014;�and this is why I am writing&#x2014;�that in my notes I somehow hurt you (what a clumsy hand I must have had, if that should have happened against all my intentions) or else, which would of course be much worse, the moment of quiet relaxation you described has again passed and bad times have again descended upon you. In case the first is true I don&#x2019;t know what to say, that&#x2019;s so far from my thoughts and everything else is so close, and for the second possibility I have no advice&#x2014;�how could I?&#x2014;�but just a simple question: Why don&#x2019;t you leave Vienna for a little while? After all, you aren&#x2019;t homeless like other people. Wouldn&#x2019;t some time in Bohemia give you new strength? And if, for reasons unknown to me, you might not want to go to Bohemia, then somewhere else, maybe even Meran would be good. Do you know it?<br><br>So I&#x2019;m expecting one of two things. Either continued silence, which means: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; Or else a few lines.<br><br>Cordially Kafka<br><br><i>It occurs to me that I �really can&#x2019;t remember your face in any precise detail. Only the way you walked away through the tables in the caf�, your figure, your dress, that I still see.</i><br><br>***<br><i>[Meran, April 1920]</i><br><br>Dear Frau Milena, You are toiling over the translation in the middle of the dreary Vienna world. Somehow I am both moved and ashamed. You will have probably already received a letter from Wolff, at least he wrote to me some time ago concerning such a letter. I did not write any novella entitled &#x201c;Murderers&#x201d; (although this was apparently advertised in a catalog)&#x2014;�there is some misunderstanding, but since it&#x2019;s supposed to be the best one of the lot maybe it&#x2019;s mine after all.<br><br>Judging from your last two letters anxiety and worry seem to have left you once and for all, this probably applies to your husband as well, how much I wish it for both of you. I recall a Sunday afternoon years ago, I was creeping along the wall of houses on the Franzensquai and ran into your husband, heading �toward me in much the same way&#x2014;�two headache experts, naturally each after his very own fashion. I don&#x2019;t remember whether we then went on together or passed each other by, the difference between these two possibilities could not have been very great. But that is past and should remain deep in the past. Is it nice at home?<br><br>Cordial greetings<br>Kafka<br><br>***<br><i>[Meran, April 1920]</i><br><br>So it&#x2019;s the lung. I&#x2019;ve been turning it over in my mind all day long, unable to think of anything else. Not that it alarms me; probably and hopefully&#x2014;�you seem to indicate as much&#x2014;�you have a mild case, and even full-�fledged pulmonary disease (half of western Europe has more or less deficient lungs), as I have known in myself for 3 years, has brought me more good things than bad. In my case it began about 3 years ago with a violent hemorrhage in the middle of the night. I was excited as one always is by something new, naturally somewhat frightened as well; I got up (instead of staying in bed, which is the prescribed treatment as I later discovered), went to the window, leaned out, went to the washstand, walked around the room, sat down on the bed&#x2014;�no end to the blood. But I wasn&#x2019;t at all unhappy, since by and by I realized that for the first time in 3, 4 practically sleepless years there was a clear reason for me to sleep, provided the bleeding would stop. It did indeed stop (and has not returned since) and I slept through the rest of the night. To be sure, the next morning the maid showed up (at that time I had an apartment in the Sch�nborn-�Palais), a good, totally devoted but extremely frank girl, she saw the blood and said: &#x201c;Pane doktore, you&#x2019;re not going to last very long.&#x201d; But I was feeling better than usual, I went to the office and did not go see the doctor until later that afternoon. The rest of the story is immaterial. I only wanted to say: it&#x2019;s not your illness which scares me (especially since I keep interrupting myself to search my memory, and underneath all your fragility I perceive something like a farm girl&#x2019;s vigor and I conclude: no, you&#x2019;re not sick, this is a warning but no disease of the lung), anyway it&#x2019;s not that which scares me, but the thought of what must have preceded this disturbance. For the moment, I&#x2019;m simply ignoring everything else in your letter, such as: not a heller&#x2014;�tea and apple&#x2014;�daily from 2 to 8&#x2014;�these are things I cannot understand which evidently require oral explanation. So I&#x2019;ll ignore all that (though only in this letter, as I cannot forget them) and just recall the explanation I applied to my own case back then and which fits many cases. You see, my brain was no longer able to bear the pain and anxiety with which it had been burdened. It said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m giving up; but if anyone else here cares about keeping the whole intact, then he should share the load and things will run a little longer.&#x201d; Whereupon my lung volunteered, it probably didn&#x2019;t have much to lose anyway. These negotiations between brain and lung, which went on without my knowledge, may well have been quite terrifying.<br><br>And what are you going to do now? The fact that you&#x2019;re being looked after is probably insignificant. Anyone who cares about you has to realize that you need a little looking after, nothing else �really matters. So is there salvation here as well? I said already&#x2014;�no, I&#x2019;m not in the mood for making jokes, I am not being funny in the least and will not be funny again until you have written how you are planning a new and healthier way of life. After your last letter I&#x2019;m not going to ask why you don&#x2019;t leave Vienna for a while, now I understand, but after all there are beautiful places close to Vienna as well, which offer many different cures and possibilities of care. Today I&#x2019;m not going to write about anything else, I don&#x2019;t have anything more important to bring up. I&#x2019;m saving everything else for tomorrow, including my thanks for the issue of Kmen which makes me moved and ashamed, happy and sad. No, there is one other thing: If you waste as much as one minute of your sleep on the translation, it will be as if you were cursing me. For if it ever comes to a trial there will be no further investigations; they will simply establish the fact: he robbed her of her sleep. With that I shall be condemned, and justly so. Thus I&#x2019;m fighting for myself when I ask you to stop.<br><br>Franz<br><br>***<br><i>[Meran, end of April 1920]</i><br><br>Dear Frau Milena, today I&#x2019;d like to write about something else but can&#x2019;t. Not that this �really bothers me; if it did then I would write something else, but now and then a deck chair �really should be ready for you somewhere in the garden, half in the shade, with about 10 glasses of milk within easy reach. It might even be in Vienna, even now in the summer&#x2014;�but without hunger and in peace. Is this impossible? And is there no one to make it possible? And what does the doctor say?<br><br>When I pulled your translation out of the large envelope, I was almost disappointed. I wanted to hear from you and not the voice from the old grave, the voice I know all too well. Why did it have to come between us? Then I realized that this same voice had also come between us, as a mediator. But apart from that it is inconceivable to me that you would take on such a troublesome task, and I am moved by your faithfulness �toward every little sentence, a faithfulness I would not have thought possible to achieve in Czech, let alone with the beautiful natural authority you attain. German and Czech so close to each other? But however that may be, the story is in any case abysmally bad, which I could prove to you, dear Frau Milena, with unparalleled ease, except that my disgust would outweigh the evidence. Naturally the fact that you like the story gives it some value, although it also makes my view of the world a little dimmer. No more about that. Wolff will send you the Country Doctor, I have written to him.<br><br>Of course I understand Czech. I&#x2019;ve meant to ask you several times already why you never write in Czech. Not to imply that your command of German leaves anything to be desired. Most of the time it is amazing and on those occasions when it does falter, the German language becomes pliant just for you, of its own accord, and then it is particularly beautiful, something a German doesn&#x2019;t even dare hope for; a German wouldn&#x2019;t dare write so personally. But I wanted to read you in Czech because, after all, you do belong to that language, because only there can Milena be found in her entirety (the translation confirms this), whereas here there is only the Milena from Vienna or the Milena preparing for Vienna. So Czech, please. And also the feuilletons you mentioned. Even if they are shabby, after all, you managed to read through the shabbiness of my story&#x2014;�how far I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe I can do the same; however, if I can&#x2019;t make it through to the end at least I&#x2019;ll get stuck in the best possible prejudice.<br><br>You ask about my engagement. I was engaged twice (or actually three times, twice to the same girl), so three times I have been separated from marriage by only a few days. The first is completely over (I hear there&#x2019;s already a new marriage and even a small boy), the second is still alive although without any prospect of marriage, so it �really isn&#x2019;t alive or rather it&#x2019;s living an independent life at the cost of the people involved. On the whole I have found here and elsewhere that men may suffer more, or if you prefer, they have less resistance in these matters; women, however, always suffer without guilt and not just because they &#x201c;can&#x2019;t do anything about it&#x201d; but in the strictest sense of the word, which may nonetheless lead to the &#x201c;can&#x2019;t do anything about it.&#x201d; Incidentally, brooding over these things is useless. It&#x2019;s like trying to smash a single cauldron in hell; first, the enterprise won&#x2019;t succeed, and second, if it does succeed, one will be consumed by the glowing effluent, while hell remains intact in all its glory. The problem must be approached differently.<br><br>In any case the first thing is to lie down in a garden and extract as much sweetness as possible from the ailment, especially if it&#x2019;s not a genuine disease. There&#x2019;s a lot of sweetness in that<br><br>Franz K.</p><h2>Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy</h2><p>Purports to uncover new evidence proving the conspiracy theory about the late President&#39;s assassination, tying the FBI, the CIA, the Mafia, the Cubans, the United States military, and others to the killing</p><p><b>Jim Marrs</b> is an award-winning journalist and independent researcher and writer. For over thirty years, he taught a course on the Kennedy assassination at the University of Texas at Arlington. Marrs lives in Springtown, Texas.Twenty-five years after the event, assassination books continue to appear. Marrs, a Dallas-area journalist who teaches a college course on the event, has, however, produced a special one. Its nearly 600 pages are jammed with detail on every aspect of the shooting, the investigations, the suspicions that fell on the Mafia, the FBI, the CIA, anti-Castro Cubans--all the usual suspects. For its comprehensiveness alone, this would be the one book for anyone seeking a really thorough examination of the assassination (but it sorely needs an index). Marrs is sensible and straightforward, giving every side of disputed questions, though it is clear that for him, as for most thoughtful people, the Warren Commission's picture of Oswald as a lone assassin doesn't work. The author talked to witnesses never officially interviewed, even offers never-before-seen pictures (though these contain nothing very startling). His conclusion: Kennedy made so many enemies in business, the military, the right wing, the mob, that his death became inevitable. He sees no Washington-based assassination plot, simply a willingness at the highest level (specifically Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover) to relax protective vigilance enough to allow the deed to be done. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Road to Ruin</h2><p>Having set up a con on Monroe Hall, a fabulously wealthy and corrupt CEO, John Dortmunder and his hapless gang of crooks suddenly find themselves caught in the deadly crossfire between their would-be mark Hall and his own victims, a group of angry union members and blue-blooded suckers who have lost their family fortunes. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>DONALD E.

Ollie had always been prying into matters that didn't concern him, so Ezekiel Bloor had made him invisible. When Charlie and his friends find him, Ollie is alone and hungry, so they promise to help him become visible again.</p><p>British boy with catchy name and unusual powers, check. Wild hair, check. Students at boarding school, check. Owls and funny street names, check. Mysterious shape-shifting enemies out to get the affable boy protagonist, check. Jenny Nimmo's "Children of the Red King" series (starring Charlie Bone) has so many of the same trappings as the Harry Potter series that, unfortunately, comparison is unavoidable. Rowling's books clearly trump these simpler fantasies for younger readers--but the Charlie Bone books are finding their audience in those who need a boy-wizard fix and need it now.<p> <i>Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy</i>, the third book in the author's planned quintet, begins when the magically "endowed" Charlie and his friend Emma discover a mostly invisible, strawberry jam-loving boy named Ollie Sparks imprisoned in the attic of the Hogwartsian Bloor's Academy. Ollie's plight is part of a seemingly amorphous Larger Evil Plot involving school authorities, a blue boa, and Charlie's three horrible great aunts. Charlie Bone and his friends are eager to fight wrongdoing with their combination of special powers, but obstacles in all shapes and sizes abound. Can the children rescue Ollie, Charlie's uncle, Ollie's older brother, and the other hapless victims...or are the enemies too plentiful and powerful? Despite the likeable Charlie and a plethora of magical happenings (raining frogs, sorcerers who escape paintings, etc.), reading this 408-page fantasy feels like a bit like running a marathon where the finish line feels farther away with every step. Thankfully, the ending is a happy one. (Ages 10 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>In the ruins of the castle of the Red King, Charlie and Tancred discover a tree-girl who whispers secrets to them and asks for their help in restoring her to a real girl.

Trixie, Honey, and their brothers set to work at the Wheelers&#x2019; game preserve to raise the money to repair it. Of course, no one expected Trixie to stumble across the trail of a dangerous poacher!</p><p>Honey shuddered and said in a scared whisper, &#x201c;That poacher might be in the thicket right now listening to every word we say. Let&#x2019;s go, Trixie. He probably has a gun.&#x201d;<br>And then, as though in proof of her statement, two shots rang out in rapid succession. The blasts were so close by that Susie shied violently. While they had been talking both girls had let the reins go slack, and, almost before they knew it, both horses had bolted and were tearing along the narrow path.<br>Susie was in the lead and by the time Trixie did gather up the reins, she was out of control. Branches of evergreens slapped Trixie in the face and brought blinding tears of pain to her eyes. She pulled as hard as she could on the curb, yelling, &#x201c;Whoa! Whoa!&#x201d; to no avail. Susie flew along as though pursued by a thousand devils. The &#x201c;devil&#x201d; in this case was only Starlight, but Trixie guessed that he, too, was panic-stricken. He was following Susie so closely that Trixie knew if the mare suddenly stopped there would be a terrific collision and Honey might be badly hurt. Susie showed no signs of even slowing, but she might stumble on a rock, and then both girls would probably be thrown. To make matters worse, the path wound dizzily through the woods so that instead of galloping in a straight line, Susie kept swerving abruptly, sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, so that it was hard for Trixie to keep her seat in the saddle. If only Honey, who was so much more experienced a horsewoman, were in the lead!<br>But finally, from sheer exhaustion, Trixie guessed, Susie gradually slowed from a dead run to a canter and at last to a trot. As the path widened, Starlight came up so that the girls were now riding abreast.<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re under control now,&#x201d; Honey gasped, her face very white, &#x201c;but where are we?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t the foggiest notion,&#x201d; Trixie got out, panting. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s stop and see if Bobby&#x2019;s compass will be of any help.&#x201d;<br>And then they came around a bend and found themselves in a large clearing, and to their amazement, right smack in the middle of it was a rustic cabin. The horses stopped of their own free will, as though they, too, were surprised.<br>Not far from the cabin was a pit in which were dying embers of a wood fire. Above it hung a black pot, and a mingling of delicious odors from it permeated the air in the clearing.<br>In an awed silence, the girls dismounted and stared at each other. &#x201c;Could this be where the poacher lives?&#x201d; Honey asked.<br>&#x201c;I guess so,&#x201d; Trixie said. &#x201c;But he must have been poaching for a long, long time. That cabin wasn&#x2019;t built in a few days. Look how long it&#x2019;s been taking the boys just to fix the roof of our clubhouse.&#x201d;<br>They moved over and peered through a window. The interior was neat and clean but sparsely furnished. A bunk was in one corner and in the center of the room there were two homemade chairs and a table. Hanging from the ceiling near the two windows on the opposite side of the cabin were several thick strips about twelve inches long which looked rather like leather.<br>&#x201c;Why, it&#x2019;s pemmican,&#x201d; Trixie suddenly cried. &#x201c;I mean, jerked venison. The Indians used to make it into pemmican. It keeps for months like that and doesn&#x2019;t have to be cooked.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Venison,&#x201d; Honey cried. &#x201c;Then those strips must be what&#x2019;s left of that dead deer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Trixie said. &#x201c;But I doubt it. That deer is probably still hanging.&#x201d;<br>With the horses trailing behind them, they went around to the back. &#x201c;Why, there&#x2019;s a vegetable garden,&#x201d; Trixie cried excitedly. She pointed to some frost-blackened vines. &#x201c;Tomatoes, pumpkin, squash, and cucumbers. That whole row of flattened tops must be carrots which haven&#x2019;t been dug yet. And there&#x2019;s kale which can stay out all winter. And look. Over there are beets, turnips, and parsnips. They don&#x2019;t have to be brought in until the weather gets very cold.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, poachers aren&#x2019;t gardeners,&#x201d; Honey said. &#x201c;At least, I don&#x2019;t think they are.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They could be,&#x201d; Trixie argued. &#x201c;Whoever lives here is trespassing on your father&#x2019;s property and killing game. That makes him a poacher.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe when the horses were running they carried us clear out of the preserve,&#x201d; Honey suggested.<br>Trixie shook her head. &#x201c;They weren&#x2019;t running in a straight line, remember? That path wound around like a corkscrew. As the crow flies, we can&#x2019;t be very far from the fork in the trail. So we must be still in your father&#x2019;s preserve.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But where?&#x201d; Honey demanded. &#x201c;And since we&#x2019;re not crows, how do you figure we are going to get back to the trail?&#x201d;<br>Trixie giggled. &#x201c;Bobby&#x2019;s compass will tell us where north is and that&#x2019;s the direction we ought to take, but since we can&#x2019;t fly in a straight line, we&#x2019;ll simply have to unwind ourselves.&#x201d;<br>Honey&#x2019;s lower lip trembled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how you can laugh, Trixie. It&#x2019;s getting darker by the minute. You know as well as I do that we&#x2019;re lost and the poacher who lives here has a gun and he&#x2019;s probably on his way home now.&#x201d; She swung up on Starlight&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;Our only hope, Trixie, is to follow the horses&#x2019; hoofprints while there&#x2019;s still light enough to see.&#x201d; Honey was right and both girls knew it. She led the way across the clearing and started slowly along the path.<br>Trixie followed on Susie. After a few minutes she asked, &#x201c;Are you following the hoofprints? I don&#x2019;t see any, not even Starlight&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t any to be seen,&#x201d; Honey said dismally. &#x201c;The path is nothing but rocks and pine needles and dead leaves. Even an FBI man couldn&#x2019;t find any kind of print on it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, at least it&#x2019;s a path,&#x201d; Trixie said, trying to sound cheerful. &#x201c;If we stick to it, we&#x2019;re bound to end up where we started." But Trixie was worried, too. Only a faint yellowish-green light filtered through the evergreen branches now, and soon there would be no light at all.&#x201c;There are two kinds of people in the world, those who read Trixie and those who don&#x2019;t.

Includes &#34;Do Not Go Gentle to That Damned Vet&#34; by Dylan Thomas&#39;s cat, &#34;The Human&#34; by Edgar Allan Poe&#39;s cat and other works.

Beard has already demonstrated his command of French in previous books, <i>French for Cats</i> and <i>Advanced French for Exceptional Cats</i>. Now he shows off his extraordinary skills as a parodist. Consider, for example, "Grendel's Dog," from "Beocat": <p> </p> . . . Then boasted Beocat, noble battle-kitten, Bane of barrow-bunnies, bold seeker of nest-booty: . . . I would lay the whelpling low with lethal claw-blows; Fur would fly and the foe would taste death-food . . . <p> Or, from a later period, William Blake's cat's poem, "The Mongrel": </p><p> </p> Mongrel! Mongrel! Barking blight, Bane upon my yard at night; What infernal hand or eye, Could frame thy vile anatomy? <p> Beard is obviously at home with poetry of many genres, from ancient odes to modern blank verse. These poems are fun even if you don't know the original sources; if you do, they are sublime.</p></p><h2>Your Two-Year-Old</h2><p>Are two-year-olds really so terrible, or does the world have a slightly skewed view of this sometimes difficult, sometimes adorable lot?

Sixteen black Southerners, elected to the U.S. Congress, arrived in Washington to advocate reforms such as public education, equal rights, land distribution, and the suppression of the Ku Klux Klan.<br> But these men faced astounding odds. They were belittled as corrupt and inadequate by their white political opponents, who used legislative trickery, libel, bribery, and the brutal intimidation of their constituents to rob them of their base of support. Despite their status as congressmen, they were made to endure the worst humiliations of racial prejudice. And they have been largely forgotten&#x2014;often neglected or maligned by standard histories of the period.<br> In this beautifully written book, Philip Dray reclaims their story. Drawing on archival documents, contemporary news accounts, and congressional records, he shows how the efforts of black Americans revealed their political perceptiveness and readiness to serve as voters, citizens, and elected officials.<br> We meet men like the war hero Robert Smalls of South Carolina (who had stolen a Confederate vessel and delivered it to the Union navy), Robert Brown Elliott (who bested the former vice president of the Confederacy in a stormy debate on the House floor), and the distinguished former slave Blanche K. Bruce (who was said to possess &#x201c;the manners of a Chesterfield&#x201d;). As Dray demonstrates, these men were eloquent, creative, and often effective representatives who, as support for Reconstruction faded, were undone by the forces of Southern reaction and Northern indifference.<br> In a grand narrative that traces the promising yet tragic arc of Reconstruction, Dray follows these black representatives&#x2019; struggles, from the Emancipation Proclamation to the onset of Jim Crow, as they fought for social justice and helped realize the promise of a new nation.<br></p><p>HMH&nbsp;hardcover, 2008, Previous ISBN 978-0-618-56370-8Philip Dray is the author of several books, including Stealing God&#x2019;s Thunder and At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America, which won the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, the Southern Book Critics Circle Award, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.</p><h2>Memory for Forgetfulness: August, Beirut, 1982 (Literature of the Middle East)</h2><p>One of the Arab world's greatest living poets uses the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the shelling of Beirut as the setting for this sequence of prose poems. Mahmoud Darwish vividly recreates the sights and sounds of a city under terrible siege. As fighter jets scream overhead, he explores the war-ravaged streets of Beirut on August 6th (Hiroshima Day).<br><br><i>Memory for Forgetfulness</i> is an extended reflection on the invasion and its political and historical dimensions. It is also a journey into personal and collective memory. What is the meaning of exile? What is the role of the writer in time of war? What is the relationship of writing (memory) to history (forgetfulness)? In raising these questions, Darwish implicitly connects writing, homeland, meaning, and resistance in an ironic, condensed work that combines wit with rage.<br><br>Ibrahim Muhawi's translation beautifully renders Darwish's testament to the heroism of a people under siege, and to Palestinian creativity and continuity.</p><p><b>Mahmoud Darwish</b> has lived most of his life in Lebanon and Palestine. The author of fourteen volumes of poetry and numerous prose works, he now lives in Paris. <b>Ibrahim Muhawi</b> is coauthor and translator of <i>Speak Bird, Speak Again: Palestinian Arab Folktales</i> (California, 1988) and <i>Journal of an Ordinary Grief</i> (Archipelago Books, 2010), for which he won the PEN Translation Prize.

Centennial Edition includes countless new annotations, a lengthy introduction, all the original illustrations, additional rare drawings, photos and maps, a new preface by Martin Gardner.</p><p>For many of us, the adventures of Dorothy in Oz will forever be associated not with Judy Garland singing &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; but with W. W. Denslow&#39;s exceedingly odd line drawings for the original editions of Baum&#39;s Oz series. The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow. The characters have a poignance and oddity that escaped the makers of the Oz movie.<p>The Wizard of Oz is a beloved American classic.&nbsp; This edition, with fine illustrations from internationally acclaimed artist Lizbeth Zwerger, has been reformatted as a readaloud edition.</p></p><h2>Henderson the Rain King (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)</h2><p>A middle-age American millionaire goes to Africa in search of a more meaningful life and receives the adoration of an African tribe that believes he has a gift for rainmaking.</p><p>Saul Bellow was born in Quebec in 1915 and moved to Chicago with his family when he was nine years old. He attended the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. In 1976 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and has also won the Pulitzer Prize, three National Book Awards, the National Medal of Arts and the 1990 National Book Foundation Medal for distinguished contribution to American letters.If this 1959 novel, one of Saul Bellow&#39;s most beloved, seems to have exceeded its shelf life, it helps to remember that much of the absurdity is intentional: Many believe the title character is a send-up of Hemingway. Joe Barrett is an excellent choice as the narrator of this tale about a rich American who journeys into remotest Africa. His gruff voice is well suited to Henderson, a physically large and garrulous man with a penchant for bombastic dialogue and philosophical ramblings. The voices Barrett gives to the African characters--notably the western-educated King Dahfu--are hardly authentic, but they&#39;re not grating, and some of the discordance can be laid at the feet of Bellow.

Christopher draws inspiration for the world of Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, from the natural beauty that surrounds his home in Montana: the tumultuous weather, the rushing Yellowstone River, and the soaring Beartooth Mountains. <br><br>Read on for Paolini and Tad Williams's discussion about why they write fantasy, their upcoming projects, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Tad:</strong> Hi, Christopher. Nice to talk to you, albeit virtually. It was great hanging out with you and your family this summer. Pretty much all of us fell in love with your part of the world, too. <br><br> Be warned: this isn't my best time of the day, so if I start calling you "Herman" and asking what it was about whaling that interested you, please forgive. <br><br> The first thing I'd like to ask you as a starter question is: why fantasy? I mean, there's the obvious answer (which is also true for me) that it was something I loved to read growing up, but I guess I'm curious what is it that still resonates for you. Why do these kind of stories, these kinds of characters, these kinds of worlds, still speak to you? <br> In a similar vein, do you have another kind of fiction, another genre, that you'd really like to try? If so, why? Any genres you think you'll never write but wish you could? <br> <br> <strong>Christopher:</strong> Hi Tad. Great talking to you as well. We all had a wonderful time when you guys visited. Definitely one of the highlights of the year. <br> <br> I'm still waking up as well -- takes a few cups of tea and a few strips of bacon before the little gray cells start firing properly -- so if I sound a bit muddled, that's why. Still, we can make a stab at coherency, eh? <br><br> Hmm. Why do I write fantasy? As you said, it's because I enjoy reading it, but I enjoy reading it because . . . well, for a number of reasons, I suppose. First of all, fantasy allows for all sorts of dangerous situations, and those can provide a lot of excitement in a story. And excitement is always fun. Also, epic fantasy usually deals with themes and situations that everyone can relate to, such as the challenge of growing up, or how one is supposed to deal with moral quandaries. Fantasy is the oldest form of literature; the very first stories that humans told while crouched around campfires were stories about gods and monsters and tragic mistakes and heroic feats. Even now, those topics still resonate with us on a primal level, which is one reason I think fantasy will remain popular with readers as long as humans are still human. And I love the sense of awe and wonder one can often find in fantastical literature. . . . Fantasy can allow you to see and hear and experience things that have never existed and never *could* exist. To me, that is the closest we come to real magic in this world. <br><br>&nbsp; That said, there are a number of other genres I'd like to try my hand at: mystery, thriller, horror, science-fiction, romance, etc. I love stories of all kinds -- although mythic ones certainly hold the greatest appeal to me -- and I'm very much looking forward to experimenting once I finish the Inheritance cycle. Any genres I think I'll never write but wish I could? . . . Probably long-form epic poetry or a witty comedy of manners. Poetry is fun, but my grasp on it is rather shaky, and a comedy of manners (while I enjoy them) is so different from my usual life, I'm not sure I could pull it off properly. <br> <br> And now a question for you: You have just finished your third (large) series. What is it about big epic stories that so fascinates you? Why not write small, intimate books about a fishmonger whose greatest love is his toothpick sculpture of the Brooklyn Bridge? <br> <br> <strong> Read the full conversation </strong><b>Tad Williams&nbsp;</b>is a California-based fantasy superstar.&nbsp; His genre-creating (and genre-busting) books have sold tens of millions worldwide.&nbsp; His considerable output of epic fantasy and epic science fiction series, fantastical stories of all kinds, urban fantasy novels, comics, scripts, etc., have strongly influenced a generation of writers.&nbsp; Tad always has several secret projects on the go. 2016 will see the debut of a number of them; March 2017 brings&nbsp;<i>The Witchwood Crown</i>, the first volume in the long-awaited return to the world of the Memory, Sorrow &amp; Thorn novels.

Homework can be completed at the learner&#39;s pace as it is not in daily format. The Book of Hebrews is a rich, dense section of Scripture that can intimidate the most scholarly biblical student. But Lisa Harper makes digging into Hebrews fun and doable, as only she can, without losing an ounce of depth. Hebrews was a sermon for a specific people and culture in the midst of martyrdom and persecution, but is also so relevant for us today, reminding us to continue walking toward Jesus regardless of our culture or our circumstances. Join Lisa as she journeys through this bridge between the Old and New Testaments to get to the heart of the matter: Jesus is our accessible King. He is not a faraway God, but an up-close Redeemer who draws near to us. Hebrews helps women make the connection between God the Father and God the Son and reminds us that Jesus is supreme, but He is also compassionate, empathetic, and loving to no end.</p><p></p><h2>The Case of the Stuttering Bishop</h2><p>A reissue of a novel from the original series finds legal eagle Perry Mason defending a millionaire heiress charged with killing her father-in-law in league with a bishop with questionable credentials, who suddenly cannot be found.

Griffin is the author of six bestselling series.Griffin already has a high profile in Berkley paperback; his six-volume Brotherhood of War saga, a Green Beret epic spanning WW II to Richard Nixon's presidency, has more than three million copies in print. With The New Breed, the series segues into hardcover, but this is not so much a sequel as a lengthy missing chapter from volume six. In late 1963, Col. Sandy Felter, formerly JFK's private Ollie North, returns from secret missions to Vietnam and the Congo and persuades new president LBJ that the Congo is as volatile as Southeast Asia. Felter's longtime friend, Manhattan banking scion Lt. Col. Craig Lowell, helps secure a crew that can combat any rebellion. Among the cast of characters: Jack Portet, an Army private who grew up flying planes in the Congo; Marjorie Bellmon, an officer's daughter for whom Jack goes "Top Gun"; Karl-Heinz Wagner, an East German who escaped through the Berlin Wall with his sister, Ursula; and Geoff Craig, Lowell's young Army cousin and Ursula's husband. The novel moves quickly, if somewhat disjointedly; Griffin's short-chapter, staccato style hampers continuity. He is also so entrenched in military jargon and lifestyle that the civilian reader may sometimes be confused. Those who have had some exposure to the service, however, will experience jolts of recognition in the hard-hitting narrative.

Her father's regiment discovered it had a murderer in its ranks, an officer who killed five people yet was never brought to trial.</p><p>A decade later, tending to the wounded on the battlefields of France during World War I, Bess learns from a dying man that the alleged murderer, Lieutenant Wade, is alive and serving at the Front. According to reliable reports, he'd died years before, so how did Wade escape India? What drove a good man to murder in cold blood? Bess uses her leave to investigate. But when she stumbles on the horrific truth, she is shaken to her very core. The facts reveal a reality that could have been her own fate.</p></p><p><p><b>Author One-on-One: Charles Todd and Deborah Crombie</b></p> <p><strong>Deborah Crombie</strong> is the bestselling author of 15 mystery novels featuring Scotland Yard Detective Inspector James, and Detective Superintendent Kincaid, including her latest, <em>The Sound of Broken Glass</em>. </p><p><strong>Deborah Crombie: </strong>Even though this is the fifth book in the "Bess Crawford" mystery series, it reads like a stand-alone novel. What's your trick to writing a series novel that can be enjoyed by a newcomer as well as a fan? </p> <p><strong>Charles Todd:</strong> We try to put ourselves in the readers&#x2019; shoes, so that he or she can start the series anywhere, and still feel right at home. That means concentrating on the current plot and setting, to make it as exciting as if it were the first time Bess ever tried to solve a mystery. That keeps the character fresh too, because our enthusiasm for Bess comes through. </p> <p><strong>DC: </strong> There is a wonderful subtext to the relationship between Bess, the WWI battlefield nurse, and Simon, her father's right-hand man in the military. What's really going on there?</p> <p><strong>CT:</strong> Simon and Bess haven&#x2019;t told us yet. There&#x2019;s most certainly chemistry there, a lot of it. Perhaps it hasn&#x2019;t dawned on them yet that there might be something more between them. Still, every once in a while, a twinge of jealousy crops up...</p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> The scenes of the British Army in India during the Colonial era (which form the background for the current story) are so colorful and fascinating, not the usual stuff of a mystery series. What inspired you to give Bess and her family a history in India?</p> <p><strong>CT:</strong> India made Bess such an intriguing character to work with. We didn&#x2019;t want her to be a staid Victorian. Instead she experiences Army life and understands duty. Her education includes a different, exotic culture. And the memory of the 1857 Indian Mutiny is always fresh, a constant reminder of danger. If you&#x2019;re going to write about a woman who can stand on her own two feet, there has to be an explanation of how she learned to be so independent. A traditional background wouldn&#x2019;t have worked.</p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> Will Bess ever meet up with Inspector Rutledge, the protagonist of your other mystery series?</p> <p><strong>CT:</strong> So far, we haven&#x2019;t come up with any good reason for letting them meet. But there is one character who is in both series&#x2014;Melinda Crawford. She&#x2019;s a cousin of Bess&#x2019;s family and has an Army background in India herself. She&#x2019;s also a close friend of Rutledge&#x2019;s family. Who knows if she&#x2019;ll ever introduce these two? And what will Simon have to say to <i>that</i>? </p><p><strong>DC:</strong> Bess is such a wonderful character, she feels so contemporary while still being true to her time. She has a real talent of drawing information out of others. What--or who--was your inspiration for Bess?</p> <p><strong>CT:</strong> The familiar Victorian woman, repressed and living under the thumb of her father and then her husband, is only one side of the picture. Intrepid Englishwomen traveled the world as missionaries or like Melinda Crawford, for adventure. Even the Suffragettes were ready to endure prison for their cause. The nurses who served in France, saving lives, were remarkable for their courage and devotion to duty. These are the real-life women who inspired Bess, women on the threshold of our time but still a very real part of their own.</p><p>In the latest mystery from <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Charles Todd, World War I nurse and amateur sleuth Bess Crawford investigates an old murder that occurred during her childhood in India, a search for the truth that will transform her and leave her pondering a troubling question: How can facts lie?</p><p>Bess Crawford enjoyed a wondrous childhood in India, where her father, a colonel in the British Army, was stationed on the Northwest Frontier. But an unforgettable incident darkened that happy time. In 1908, Colonel Crawford's regiment discovered that it had a murderer in its ranks, an officer who killed five people in India and England yet was never brought to trial. In the eyes of many of these soldiers, men defined by honor and duty, the crime was a stain on the regiment's reputation and on the good name of Bess's father, the Colonel Sahib, who had trained the killer.</p><p>A decade later, tending to the wounded on the battlefields of France during World War I, Bess learns from a dying Indian sergeant that the supposed murderer, Lieutenant Wade, is alive&#x2014;and serving at the Front. Bess cannot believe the shocking news. According to reliable reports, Wade's body had been seen deep in the Khyber Pass, where he had died trying to reach Afghanistan. Soon, though, her mind is racing. How had he escaped from India? What had driven a good man to murder in cold blood?</p><p>Wanting answers, she uses her leave to investigate. In the village where the first three killings took place, she discovers that the locals are certain that the British soldier was innocent. Yet the present owner of the house where the crime was committed believes otherwise, and is convinced that Bess's father helped Wade flee. To settle the matter once and for all, Bess sets out to find Wade and let the courts decide.</p><p>But when she stumbles on the horrific truth, something that even the famous writer Rudyard Kipling had kept secret all his life, she is shaken to her very core. The facts will damn Wade even as they reveal a brutal reality, a reality that could have been her own fate.</p></p><h2>Wanderings: History of the Jews</h2><p>A fascinating history of the Jews, told by a master novelist, here is Chaim Potok&#39;s fascinating, moving four thousand-year history.

At the heart of this family, and central to the lifeblood of her latest story, is Fuller&#x2019;s iconically courageous mother, Nicola (or, Nicola Fuller of Central Africa, as she sometimes prefers to be known). Born on the Scottish Isle of Skye to a warlike clan of highlanders and raised in Kenya's perfect equatorial light, Nicola holds dear the values most likely to get you hurt or killed in Africa: loyalty to blood, passion for land, and a holy belief in the restorative power of all animals. With a lifetime of admiration behind her and after years of interviews and research, Fuller has recaptured her mother's inimitable voice with remarkable precision. <i>Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness</i> is as funny, exotic, terrifying and unselfconscious as Nicola herself.</p><p>We see Nicola as an irrepressible child in western Kenya, then with the man who fell in love with her, Tim Fuller.&nbsp; The young couple begin their life in a lavender colored honeymoon period, when east Africa lies before them with all the promise of its liquid honeyed light, even as the British empire in which they both once believed wanes. But in short order, an accumulation of mishaps and tragedies bump up against history until the Fullers find themselves in a world they hardly recognize. We follow Tim and Nicola as they hopscotch the continent, restlessly trying to establish a home, from Kenya to Rhodesia to Zambia, even returning to England briefly. War, hardship and tragedy seem to follow the family even as Nicola fights to hold onto her children, her land, her sanity.&nbsp; But just when it seems that Nicola has been broken by the continent she loves, it is the African earth&nbsp; - and Tim's acceptance of her love for this earth - that revives and nurtures her.</p><p>A story of survival and war, love and madness, loyalty and forgiveness, <i>Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness</i> is an intimate exploration of the author&#x2019;s family and of the price of being possessed by this uncompromising, fertile, death-dealing land. In the end we find Nicola and Tim at a table under their Tree of Forgetfulness in the Zambezi Valley on the banana and fish farm where they plan to spend their final days. In local custom, the Tree of Forgetfulness is where villagers meet to resolve disputes and it is here that the family at last find an African kind of peace.

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt paperbackISBN&nbsp;978-0-618-26030-0</p><h2>Conceptual Integrated Science--Explorations</h2><p>Brand new text and workbook bundled in plastic.

"The Albanian Virgin" smashes the idea that all of her stories are set in B.C. or in Ontario's "Alice Munro Country." "A Wilderness Station" breaks short story rules by transporting us back to the 1830s and then jumping forward more than a hundred years.

This engaging narrative slices through the cobwebs of time, memory, and prevailing cynicism to reinvigorate America with an informed patriotism.</p><p>Like the previous volume of <i>America: The Last Best Hope,</i> Volume II responds to Reagan's heartfelt call for an informed patriotism, telling the riveting story of the last century's great wars, the rise of world Communism, the struggle of freedom at home and abroad, and the triumph of liberty.</p></p><p><p>Dr. William J. Bennett&nbsp;is one of America&#x2019;s most influential and respected voices on cultural, political, and educational issues.&nbsp;Host of the top-ten nationally syndicated radio show<em>Bill Bennett&#x2019;s Morning in America</em>, he is also the Washington Fellow of the Claremont Institute. He is the author and editor&nbsp;of more than twenty-five&nbsp;books.</p>The second volume of Bennett's overview of U.S. history begins with the events leading up to WWI, tracing the progress of the U.S. through the end of Reagan's presidency. Bennett (The Book of Virtues) has a long history of government service-he was Secretary of Education under Ronald Reagan and Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under George H.W. Bush-and the overall tone of the book reflects the deep respect he holds for America's leaders, history and institutions. Bennett is a leading figure in the neoconservative movement, so his interpretation of America's last 90 years is informed by that perspective. But while he wears both his patriotism and politics on his sleeve, Bennett avoids flag-waving or talk-radio-style generalizations. This is a breezy, heartfelt survey, written with the average reader in mind, that will appeal broadly to those looking for an America-friendly introduction to 20th century U.S. history. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Travelling to his grandfather&#39;s castle, Cedric shows his trusting and democratic nature in his dealings with lawyers and clergymen, servants and farmers, but it is his relationship with his proud and unfeeling grandfather which lies at the heart of the novel, and developments there take an unexpected turn when the appearance of an unforeseen rival claimant to the title brings the book to a dramatic climax. First published in 1886, the story soon became a huge success throughout Europe and America, and achieved unjust notoriety when its hero&#39;s costume of black velvet with lace collar created a fashion for Little Lord Fauntleroy suits which were foisted upon reluctant children. Despite this reaction, however, the warmth and humour of Frances Hodgson Burnett&#39;s story have ensured its survival as a children&#39;s classic and an enduring phenomenon of popular culture.

Clark Strand, an English teacher who has lived as a Zen Buddhist monk, has written an engaging book that weaves personal memoir with poetry instruction. The book is well written if unusual, a happily meandering series of lessons that encourage the reader to appreciate how the writing and reading of haiku can become a very practical meditative process.Clark Strand has taught at The New York Open Center, and The Juilliard School.</p><h2>Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O&#39;Neill</h2><p>The memoirs of Speaker of the House Tip O&#39;Neill&#39;s career sketch his ties with the Kennedys, his break with Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam, the Watergate years, and his dealings with Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan</p><p>Canny folk hero O'Neill alludes here to another such, the legendary mayor of Boston: "When the good Lord made James Michael Curley, He broke the mold"; and if you substitute his own name, you have the flavor of this knowing, pietistic, jolly, seductive memoir, written with Novak, coauthor of Iacocca. In the all-but-vanished tradition of ward healer, the retired Speaker of the House, writing in the first person, blends treacle ("I would work to make sure my own people could go to places like Harvard") and shrewdness ("power accumulates when people think you have power"), idealism and pragmatism, humor and heft as he relates anecdotes about the national figures he has dealt with in Washington, D.C., and politicians in Massachusetts where he spent eight terms in the legislature before joining Congress in 1952. Like "a good Irish pol who can carry on six conversations at once," O'Neill talks about baseball, poker and his boyhood gang, issues of governance and the functioning of Congress, in which he served for 34 years. "All politics is local," he writes, and this memoir makes that a truism, bringing national imperatives back home to the national constituency. 150,000 first printing; first serial to the Los Angeles Times Syndicate; BOMC selection; author tour.

O'Neill, recently retired Speaker of the House, learned politics growing up in Irish-Catholic Boston, and these roots pervade his 50-year political career. He relates his experiences by stringing together apocryphal stories and true incidentsembellished, no doubt, by collaborator Novak. Of particular interest are his assessments of presidents from FDR on. O'Neill is not reticent about criticizing Democratic leaders as well as Republicans.

The journals, she says, listen to her. They have been company on travels, and she is indebted to them for consolation, advice, humor, sanity. Now the bestselling author of The Artist&#39;s Way offers readers the same companion, in which we may discover ourselves, our fears and aspirations, and our life&#39;s daily flow. Readers will find privacy, a portable writing room, where our opinions are for our own eyes. Morning Pages prioritize the day, providing clarity and comfort.With an introduction and instructions on how to use this journal, by Julia Cameron, readers will uncover the history of their spirits as they move their hands across the universe of their lives. The idea behind Julia Cameron&#39;s The Artist&#39;s Way is that by writing three pages, longhand and stream-of consciousness, first thing in the morning, you can overcome the obstacles that stop you from becoming your most creative self. This works partly because it forces you to create something (even if it is just a long list of gripes) every single day. It doesn&#39;t take much time. You&#39;re not even supposed to think. But the act itself gets you past all that self-defeating fretting about why you think you aren&#39;t a creative person. Cameron sees her morning pages as a form of meditation, as spiritual windshield wipers. While Cameron touts the morning pages as a way of life, she suggests you start out doing them as part of a twelve-week program to recover your creativity.

H.G. Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, enters into the spirit of one of its most fervent shrines: Odessa, a city in decline in the desert of West Texas, where the Permian High School Panthers have managed to compile the winningest record in state annals. Indeed, as this breathtaking examination of the town, the team, its coaches, and its young players chronicles, the team, for better and for worse, <i>is</i> the town; the communal health and self-image of the latter is directly linked to the on-field success of the former. The 1988 season, the one <i>Friday Night Lights</i> recounts, was not one of the Panthers' best. The game's effect on the community--and the players--was explosive. Written with great style and passion, <i>Friday Night Lights</i> offers an American snapshot in deep focus; the picture is not always pretty, but the image is hard to forget.H. G.

She lives in California. </p>Grade 4-7&#x2013;A letter written in 1878 to Santa Claus by a 10-year-old boy asking not for presents but to know what Santa himself wishes for allows the gent (aka Nicholas, King of Forever) and his wife to realize their greatest dream, the birth of a daughter named Holly. She is, however, cursed by an evil sorcerer, Herrikhan, who surrounds her infant heart with ice and promises to return to collect it one day. Holly grows up happy but lonely in the Land of the Immortals, and when she becomes a young woman, she takes a daring and possibly deadly trip to Victorian New York City, where she is determined to do good deeds. There she has adventures, brings joy to the hearts of young and old, and manages to foil Herrikhan with the shining purity of her love. The writing is acceptable, if a little precious, and the descriptions of Nicholas and his household are a pleasure to read, but the whole Herrikhan plot is jarring, inconsistent, and unnecessary; there are more than enough characters and subplots swirling through this novel already without the addition of a leering, black-tongued sorcerer. The drawings scattered throughout are detailed and a touch old-fashioned, a good match for the sentimental tone of the text. Fans of Alcott, Spyri, and Burnett may enjoy this long and convoluted tale.<i>&#x2013;Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But happiness is more elusive than a medal, and Harry must continue to run--from his wife, his life, and from himself, until he reaches the end of the road and has to turn back....</p><p>I read Rabbit, Run when I was in high school (and it wasn't even a school assignment!). Twenty years later (at least!), three very vivid scenes from that book still pop into my head from time to time. The first is the used-car lot, where Rabbit Angstrom, the former basketball star, works for his father-in-law. The second scene is in a very red Chinese restaurant that had changed over from a French restaurant only the week before. Rabbit is there with his old coach and two women that are not their wives, and they drink daiquiris and whiskey sours. This restaurant could have been (and was) in my small town. The third scene is the most harrowing, and I've repeated it as a cautionary tale to young mothers for years, telling the story as if it had happened to someone I know. Janice, Rabbit's wife, who slugs alcohol throughout her pregnancy, is drunk and bathing her newborn baby when something terrible happens. I won't ruin it by telling you more. I read hundreds of books a year, both for my job and for pleasure, so the fact that parts of this book are so indelibly etched in my mind is a testament to the talent and genius of John Updike.<br>P.S. all of the other books in the Rabbit series are equally unforgettable.<br>--Maureen O'Neal"Brilliant and poignant...By his compassion, clarity of insight and crystal-bright prose, he makes Rabbit's sorrow his and our own."<br>--<i>The Washington Post</i></p><h2>The Book of Awakening</h2><p>Gently used hardcover All order ship within 24 hours</p><p></p><h2>Indiana Jones and the Genesis Deluge</h2><p>A Wash in Evil<br><br>London, 1927.

Originally from England, he now lives in the United States.Now that he's a bestselling fantasy novelist, Gaiman returns to the comics series that made his reputation with this new volume of seven gorgeously illustrated stories. Gaiman specializes in inventing fantastic allegories for the quotidian, in a voice that casually shifts between uneasy realism and Borgesian grandeur. In Sandman cosmology, "The Endless" are seven immortal siblings who personify abstract concepts: Dream, Death, Destiny and so on. This work devotes a story to each of them, drawn in distinctly different styles by an all-star lineup of American, British and European cartoonists and fine artists. Gaiman is famous for writing to his artists' strengths, and he does so here. P. Craig Russell draws the surreal fantasia "Death and Venice" with the opulent brio of his opera adaptations. "What I've Tasted of Desire" is a darkly sexual fable, painted by Milo Manara in the style of his more X-rated work. A couple of the stories find Gaiman working in a more experimental mode than usual, notably "Fifteen Portraits of Despair," a set of anecdotes and prose poems accompanied by Barron Storey's tormented, abstract drawings and paintings. Longtime comics fans will notice plenty of inside jokes in "The Heart of a Star," but most of this book is a red carpet-or perhaps a Persian rug-rolled out for Gaiman's prose readers to see his visions turned into lush, dramatic images. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Mismeasure of Man</h2><p><p><strong>The definitive refutation to the argument of <em>The Bell Curve</em>.</strong></p><strong></strong>When published in 1981, <em>The Mismeasure of Man</em> was immediately hailed as a masterwork, the ringing answer to those who would classify people, rank them according to their supposed genetic gifts and limits.<br> <br> Yet the idea of biology as destiny dies hard, as witness the attention devoted to <em>The Bell Curve</em>, whose arguments are here so effectively anticipated and thoroughly undermined.

Further, he has added five essays on questions of The Bell Curve in particular and on race, racism, and biological determinism in general. These additions strengthen the book's claim to be, as Leo J.

Dr Jekyll has discovered the ultimate drug. A chemical that can turn him into something else. Suddenly, he can unleash his deepest cruelties in the guise of the sinister Hyde. Transforming himself at will, he roams the streets of fog-bound London as his monstrous alter-ego. It seems he is master of his fate. It seems he is in complete control. But soon he will discover that his double life comes at a hideous price ...</p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

They grow old, and even the best of them, one day, lose the power of flight.... On very rare occasions, however, a broom can lose its power without warning, and fall, with its passenger, to the earth below ... which is just what happened one cold autumn night many years ago." So begins <i>The Widow's Broom</i>, the gentle, strangely captivating book by Chris Van Allsburg, who received Caldecott medals for <i>Jumanji</i> and <i>The Polar Express</i>.<p> The story gets under way when the lonely widow Minna Shaw finds a wounded, sky-fallen witch in her vegetable garden. The witch disappears before dawn, but leaves her old, presumably defunct broom behind. Minna begins to use it around the house and finds that "it was no better or worse than brooms she'd used before." However, one morning, Minna sees the broom sweeping by itself! Opportunistically, she trains it to chop wood and fetch water.</p><p> When the neighbors find out about this "wicked, wicked thing" (posing as an innocent, hardworking broom), they accost the widow and demand that the broom be burned. Are they successful in separating the lonely widow and her diligently sweeping friend? This is a wonderfully suspenseful book to read aloud and young listeners will earnestly hope for the broom's survival. Still, older, wiser readers, ages 8 and older, will be swept up in the story, too.</p>Some of Minna Shaw&#39;s neighbors don&#39;t trust her clever broom. &#34;It&#39;s dangerous&#34;, they say. &#34;It&#39;s a wicked, wicked thing&#34;. Minna disagrees. She appreciates the broom&#39;s help around the house. She enjoys its quiet company. It seems perfectly innocent and hardworking to her. But one day two children get a well-deserved thrashing from the broom. For her neighbors, this is proof of the broom&#39;s evil spirit. Minna is obliged to give up her dear companion. Chris Van Allsburg, master of the mysterious, brings this supernatural tale to life with moody and memorable pictures that will haunt readers long after the book&#39;s covers are closed.</p><h2>West of Eden: An American Place</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER �&nbsp;An epic, mesmerizing oral history of Hollywood and Los Angeles from the author of the contemporary classic&nbsp;<i>Edie</i></b><br><br>Jean Stein transformed the art of oral history in her groundbreaking book <i>Edie: American Girl,</i> an indelible portrait of Andy Warhol &#x201c;superstar&#x201d; Edie Sedgwick, which was edited with George Plimpton. Now, in <i>West of Eden,</i> she turns to Los Angeles, the city of her childhood. Stein vividly captures a mythic cast of characters: their ambitions and triumphs as well as their desolation and grief.<br><br> These stories illuminate the bold aspirations of five larger-than-life individuals and their families. <i>West of Eden</i> is a work of history both grand in scale and intimate in detail. At the center of each family is a dreamer who finds fortune and strife in Southern California: Edward Doheny, the Wisconsin-born oil tycoon whose corruption destroyed the reputation of a U.S. president and led to his own son&#x2019;s violent death; Jack Warner, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, who together with his brothers founded one of the world&#x2019;s most iconic film studios; Jane Garland, the troubled daughter of an aspiring actress who could never escape her mother&#x2019;s schemes; Jennifer Jones, an actress from Oklahoma who won the Academy Award at twenty-five but struggled with despair amid her fame and glamour. Finally, Stein chronicles the ascent of her own father, Jules Stein, an eye doctor born in Indiana who transformed Hollywood with the creation of an unrivaled agency and studio.<br><br> In each chapter, Stein paints a portrait of an outsider who pins his or her hopes on the nascent power and promise of Los Angeles. Each individual&#x2019;s unyielding intensity pushes loved ones, especially children, toward a perilous threshold. <i>West of Eden</i> depicts the city that has projected its own image of America onto the world, in all its idealism and paradox.

Beyond the fence the hill sloped for several miles. On this lower level faint and far off I could just barely see some of the old wooden derricks of the oilfield from which the Sternwoods had made their money. . . . A little of it was still producing in groups of wells pumping five or six barrels a day. The Sternwoods, having moved up the hill, could no longer smell the stale sump water or the oil, but they could still look out of their front windows and see what had made them rich.

And the story of Edward L. Doheny is centered around a Pandora&#x2019;s box that unleashed an extraordinary sequence of events, enthralling the nation for a decade. It involved the fall and death of a president. It involved millions and millions of dollars paid to some of the most gifted lawyers in the country. It involved two slayings intimately connected to Doheny in circumstances that are still very murky. And it ended in the fall from grace for Doheny&#x2014;at one point the richest man in America&#x2014;who died in 1935 broken and disgraced, very much by his own actions and his determination to protect himself<br><br>Patrick &#x201c;Ned&#x201d; Doheny: My great-grandfather was shocked at the way that everything spun out. When you think about a guy that strong being broken, you have to wonder what it must have been like to have had to deal with all those elements, who you had to be in order to survive it. It was a tragedy, but the history books have always done a hatchet job on him. It&#x2019;s the heartlessness that I find the most bitter about the interpretation of our family. And it upsets me that someone like my great-grandfather, who was such a seminal figure, gets supplanted by a cardboard stick figure. That&#x2019;s madness.<br><br>What my great-grandfather did is almost beyond conception in terms of the amount of money that he made, the success that he enjoyed, and the wildness of his adventure. That whole business with There Will Be Blood, however, was completely apocryphal. There&#x2019;s not a shred of truth in it. The only true part of the film was at the beginning, with him in the mine shaft by himself: he did always say he once fell down a mine shaft and broke his legs. But all the rest of it is utter horseshit. All these people&#x2014;Upton Sinclair with Oil! and later the movie people&#x2014;had a vested interest in furthering their own agendas, and it&#x2019;s ludicrous to confuse those agendas with history. I enjoyed the movie, and I thought Daniel Day-Lewis was outrageously good. But it had nothing to do with my people at all.

One thinks of Mulholland as being the twisted godfather who summoned L.A. into existence because he brought the water that allowed it to grow. But Doheny symbolizes the other way wealth was acquired in the first thirty years when L.A. was really growing. Between 1900 and 1930, the population went from something like one hundred thousand to one million and a quarter.<br><br>Mike Davis: The recent history of Los Angeles had been an exhilarating then terrifying roller-coaster ride. In late 1885 the arrival of the Santa Fe railroad in Southern California broke the decade-long monopoly of the Southern Pacific. By March the most extraordinary rate war in American history began with fares from Chicago dropping to an absurd one dollar then stabilizing at ten dollars. Two hundred thousand curious visitors took advantage of the cheap fares to come visit the Land of Sunshine and dip their toes into the Pacific. First, however, they had to run a gauntlet of realtors and their sandwich-board boys waiting outside the stations to sell them a dream lot in one of the new garden suburbs or in the barren hills around the city. Los Angeles was laying ultramodern concrete sidewalks, but its main streets remained dirt and gravel and too often mud. But an old prospector like Doheny was probably happier with bare rock and exposed ground. He also may have enjoyed the ineradicable wildness everywhere on the city&#x2019;s edges. Los Angeles had little water, no coal, no improved harbor, no manufacturing, a still largely undeveloped hinterland, and a permanent shortage of capital. But these comprehensive disadvantages were the secret of the locals; the newcomers, having seen Eden, were easily convinced to buy a piece of it.<br><br>Richard Rayner: The population was driven by oil, and Doheny was the guy who created the L.A. oil industry, even though he made the vast part of his fortune in Mexico. In the 1920s L.A. produced 20 percent of the world&#x2019;s oil. When you look at pictures of the great forests of oil derricks studded all over the city or read Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s Oil!, you see it. It&#x2019;s absolutely staggering, and Doheny was responsible for that. But there are all these years of his life before that period about which not much is known, when he was roaming around the West in the 1870s and 1880s. We don&#x2019;t really start to get to know him until he&#x2019;s in his forties. I suspect he was quite desperate by then, because everything had failed. But we do know the story of his first wife, whom he left alone&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s quite dark.<br><br>MaryAnn Bonino: Edward Doheny married his first wife, Carrie Wilkins, in Kingston, New Mexico, in 1883. She never knew her father, a Civil War surgeon who went off to war when she was an infant and didn&#x2019;t come back. She and her mother lived the life of pioneers&#x2014;and it was a very hard life, in particular for women on their own. In spite of all of that, Carrie seems to have been a woman of considerable sensitivity. She was active in the Episcopal church and also an engaging amateur singer, taking a &#x201c;large audience by storm&#x201d; when she and Edward lived in Kingston, and also later in Silver City. After they moved to Los Angeles in 1891, their emotional and financial lives were marked with highs and lows. Their son, Ned, was born in 1893, but their seven-year-old daughter, Eileen, died one year earlier of a rheumatic heart condition. Edward discovered oil in Los Angeles and Orange County, but as he took on new business risks things became financially rocky&#x2014;which might explain why between 1895 and 1899 they changed their residence every single year. In late April 1899, Carrie decided to take some time away, going to San Francisco and taking Ned with her. It may be that she went north because Edward himself was moving to Kern County, where he had just found oil. But since Carrie never came back, she may have left for another reason. It was during this time that Estelle Betzold, who would later become Edward&#x2019;s second wife, was working as a telephone operator&#x2014;most likely in the same building as his office. The story goes that Edward heard Estelle&#x2019;s voice and was charmed by it. She did have a charming voice&#x2014;everyone said that&#x2014;and a playful and sassy style. It may be that Carrie&#x2019;s departure coincided with an initial flirtation between Estelle and Edward.<br><br>Carrie didn&#x2019;t divorce Edward until eleven months after she left him. Even then, and after moving to Oakland, she must have retained some feelings for him. In late September 1900&#x2014;about a month after Edward married Estelle, and three weeks after he brought his new bride to San Francisco (and probably across the bay to Oakland)&#x2014;Carrie killed herself. The published biographies of Doheny suggest strongly that Carrie was in some way disturbed, but the facts suggest otherwise.<br><br>Carole Wells Doheny: Carrie got so despondent over him getting married that she killed herself. The family later got depression from her. It&#x2019;s a very cruel thing that happens to people. But nobody really talks about her.<br><br>MaryAnn Bonino: She drank battery fluid. According to the women who worked for her, she confused it for a cold medication she had ordered from the pharmacy. She may have staged it to look like a mistake. Ned was probably there. She took the poison during the morning when he was very likely at school, but he would certainly have been around for the aftermath and heard the reports of her &#x201c;violent screaming,&#x201d; which went on for some hours. And on top of all that, Ned remained in that same house for almost ten months after her death. Perhaps Edward and Estelle thought it would be better to leave Ned in Oakland with familiar staff and a routine he was accustomed to. They themselves were overwhelmed by events. In addition to the shock of Carrie&#x2019;s suicide, their own marriage of barely a month was completely unplanned, they had no home of their own, and Edward faced an enormous amount of work resulting from his otherwise incredible piece of luck&#x2014;his discovery of oil in Mexico. But that plan clearly didn&#x2019;t work because Ned was acting up and kicking his governess black and blue. By the end of July 1901, Estelle was in Oakland taking care of him herself, and two weeks later she wrote to Edward, &#x201c;You and I would&#x2019;ve been condemned for murder if we hadn&#x2019;t come to the rescue by this time.&#x201d;<br><br>Richard Rayner: The story of Doheny&#x2019;s involvement in Mexico is utterly amazing. It&#x2019;s both this wonderful entrepreneurial swashbuckling adventure and an absolutely naked act of imperial manipulation and theft. Doheny serially bribed his way upwards through the Mexican government until he became friendly with President Porfirio D�az, from whom he secured exclusive rights to drill for oil in an area near the town of Tampico that held the richest oil deposits in the world at that time. And after the fall of his buddy D�az in the Mexican Revolution, he managed to maneuver through the various political changes and insurgencies that followed and maintain his holdings.<br><br>Patrick &#x201c;Ned&#x201d; Doheny: Regarding the whole business with the oil lands in Mexico, my god, there were whole countries angling for that. The British were in there, and the Germans were in there, too. That&#x2019;s where we get ranchero music, which is basically &#x201c;oompa&#x201d; music from Germany. That&#x2019;s why Mexican beer is so good, too. Everybody was trying to back whatever petty tyrant they could, to ensure that they could get their hands on whatever natural resources were there.<br><br>Richard Rayner: From 1903 to 1918, Doheny took sixty-five trips to Mexico, suborning and turning a huge area covering 450,000 acres of the countryside into a personal fiefdom with a clear-cut apartheid system. It was a microcosm and an exaggeration of what America tried to pretend that it wasn&#x2019;t at the time. Not surprisingly, he was resented and hated by a lot of people in Mexico. Reports at that time from the Bureau of Investigation, the precursor to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, note various Mexican revolutionaries hanging around outside Doheny&#x2019;s mansion in L.A. on Chester Place. At least one historian, Dan La Botz, even thinks that Doheny might later have been behind the assassination of Venustiano Carranza, Mexico&#x2019;s constitutional president who had wanted to nationalize the oil industry. True or not, early on Doheny clearly saw that the leftist movement in Mexico could threaten him, so he eventually built a private army to protect his massive holdings, especially when Mexico was in the throes of a revolution. But his real aim was to get the U.S. Marines to occupy Mexico so that he wouldn&#x2019;t have to protect everything himself. Through it all, Doheny managed to hold on through various means. And he caused a lot of anger down there.<br><br>John Creel: Edward Doheny realized how useful my great-uncle, Enrique Creel, could be for his agenda, since Enrique was a very prominent statesman and banker in Mexico with strong connections to President D�az. When Enrique was the Mexican ambassador to the United States, Doheny gave a banquet in his honor at the exclusive Alexandria Hotel in Los Angeles. The event, called &#x201c;one of the most notable ever given in California,&#x201d; by the Los Angeles Examiner, featured Caviar Imperiale D&#x2019;Astrakhan as a starter. Doheny even arranged for special fountains on the elliptical dinner table that spouted streams of red, white, and green, with the voice of Caruso serenading the guests from underneath the table. The event cost easily $150 a plate&#x2014;in 1907 dollars&#x2014;and was referred to as &#x201c;a riot of extravagance&#x201d; by the Examiner&#x2019;s rival, the Los Angeles Times. I would have loved to have been there. They knew how to entertain, didn&#x2019;t they?<br><br>Richard Rayner: Perhaps not coincidentally, a week before Doheny threw the banquet for Enrique Creel, private detectives in L.A. under orders from Creel brutally arrested the fugitive Mexican intellectual Ricardo Flores Mag�n, a leading anarchist who advocated for land reform in Mexico. Doheny managed to hold on to his bit of Mexico through an extraordinary dance of daring and corruption. It&#x2019;s Doheny at his boldest.<br><br>Patrick &#x201c;Ned&#x201d; Doheny: Estelle was holding on for dear life then, with these periods of incredible loneliness when she never saw this person she&#x2019;d married&#x2014;and then boom, he would come back from Mexico. He was probably the richest man in the United States. Can you imagine what it would have been like to have found yourself in that situation, in that time? For god&#x2019;s sakes, you go from being a telephone operator to having Steinway make you a piano with a bust of your child on either side of the keyboard? You can go look in the Steinway catalog. They made a piano with Ned&#x2019;s head carved into it.

Among them are the questions: Does archeological evidence support the theory that the real King Arthur was a British resistance hero who fought Germanic tribes around 540 A.D.? Is the Sutton Hoo grave in East Anglia the burial site of a dead king? What motivated warrior queen Boadicea to poison herself when the Romans crushed the uprising she led? Wood writes with grace and conversational verve as he incorporates the latest findings. He humanizes some of the most uninspiring or obscure figures in British history, including Ethelred the Unready; Eric Bloodaxe, ruler of Viking York; Anglo-Saxon imperialist king Offa, who staged a coup d'etat; and Alfred the Great, pioneer of town planning.

Why should the be forced to make an impossible choice? The Bird in the Tree Few women her age were as beautiful or as cherished by their families as Lucilla Eliot. In her love for the Eliot clan, she had worked to make Damerosehay, her home on the Hampshire coast, a captivatingly beautiful refuge, capable of withstanding any threat to family happiness. Now, her lifetime&#39;s labor was about to be destroyed by her favorite grandson David. In love with Nadin, the estranged wife of another man, he faced an impossible choice: surrender his devotion to the woman he loved and preserve his family&#39;s integrity or marry her and destroy everything that Lucilla had worked so hard to preserve. The love of children, the wisdom of an old woman, the traditions of the family home, and the lonely splendor of the marshes and the sea all play their part in this beautiful tale, sensitively told. This is the first of Elizabeth Goudge&#39;s three novels about the Eliot family - the others are entitled Pilgrim&#39;s Inn and The Heart of the Family.</p><p>8 1.5-hour cassettesElizabeth de Beauchamp Goudge was born on April 24th 1900 in Wells, Somerset, where her father was Principal of Wells Theological College. Although she had privately intended writing as a career, her parents insisted she taught handicrafts in Oxford. She began writing in her spare time and her first novel ISLAND MAGIC, set in Guernsey, was a great success here and in America. GREEN DOLPHIN COUNTRY (1944) projected her to fame, netting a Literary Guild Award and a special prize of GBP30,000 from Louis B. Mayer of MGM before being filmed.

Here, she and her friends and neighbors study nature month by month. The intent of being simultaneously instructive and entertaining is a tall order, yet Linnea makes learning fun. Altogether, there are more than 30 ideas--from recipes to craft projects to keeping nature records--for readers' delight. Even more impresssive is the book's visual appeal. The watercolor and ink pictures are captivating; the well-planned layout and varying lettering styles are sure to appeal to readers. Because the book is a Swedish import, some objects of nature (e.g. the chaffinch) will be unfamiliar to American readers. Still, this beautiful book deserves to be placed within reach of nature-loving and inquistive children.

The "Polies," as they are known, live in almost total darkness for six months of the year, in winter temperatures as low as 100 degrees below zero--with no way in or out before the spring.<p>During the long winter of 1999, Dr. Nielsen, solely responsible for the mental and physical fitness of a team of researchers, construction workers, and support staff, discovered a lump in her breast. Consulting via email with doctors in the United States, she performed a biopsy on herself, and in July began chemotherapy treatments to ensure her survival until condition permitted her rescue in October. A daring rescue by the Air National Guard ensued, who landed, dropped off a replacement physician, and minutes later took off with Dr. Nielsen.</p><p>This is Dr. Nielsen's own account of her experience at the Pole, the sea change as she becomes "of the Ice," and her realization that as she would rather be on Antarctica than anywhere else on earth. It is also a thrilling adventure of researchers and scientists embattled by a hostile environment; a penetrating exploration of the dynamics of an isolated, intensely connected community faced with adversity; and, at its core, a powerfully moving drama of love and loss, of one woman's voyage of self-discovery through an extraordinary struggle for survival.</p></p><p>Serving as doctor to the Americans "wintering over" at the South Pole in 1999, Jerri Nielsen made headlines when she discovered a lump in her breast that a self-administered biopsy revealed to be an aggressive, fast-growing cancer. No flights in or out of Antarctica are possible during the continent's long winter, and Nielsen's account of giving herself chemotherapy while she and her fellow "Polies" waited for the weather to break is even more gripping than the news reports at the time. She's candid about her pain and fear; the media battle waged by her embittered ex-husband makes her ordeal even more challenging. Interestingly enough, however, this high drama does not overshadow Nielsen's deeper narrative of a woman who came "to the Ice" seeking new meaning in a life shattered by divorce and estrangement from her children. In the back-to-basics world of Antarctic medicine, with outdated equipment, few supplies, and no assistants, she rediscovered her vocation as a doctor, free from the imperatives of corporate-directed medicine. More importantly, Nielsen found spiritual solace in the world's most extreme environment, where she was "introduced slowly to the notion of giving more than you have and using less than you need ... of knowing that all you really own are your own thoughts." She makes the glories of the Pole so palpable that, by the end, readers will not even be surprised when she signs an e-mail to her family, "from the wonderful Ice." <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Dr. Jerri Nielsen lives in Ohio and is the mother of three children. She continues to practice medicine and intends to do a lot of traveling.</p><h2>Miracle on Voodoo Mountain: A Young Woman&#39;s Remarkable Story of Pushing Back the Darkness for the Children of Haiti</h2><p><p><strong>"It took months of God waking me up in the middle of the night before I realized I was the one He was calling to leave my comfortable American life and move to Haiti."</strong></p><p><em>Miracle on Voodoo Mountain</em>&nbsp;is the inspirational memoir of an accomplished and driven 24-year old who quit her job, sold everything, and moved to Haiti, by herself&#x2014;all without a clear plan of action.

From becoming the adoptive mother of former child slaves, to receiving the divine gift of the Haitian Creole language, to starting, building, and running a school for more than 500 children, "the amazingness of what God did after I made the choice to be obedient is incredible," said Megan.</p><p>Three years later, six acres on Bellevue Mountain in Gressier is the home of the nonprofit Respire Haiti at the former site of voodoo worship, and in the area that many still come to make animal sacrifices, Megan and her staff of nearly 200 are transforming this community as they educate, feed, and address the needs.</p></p><p>Megan Boudreaux, at the age of 24,founded Respire Haiti, a non-profit to fight for the freedom of Haiti&#39;s estimated 300,000 child slaves. Megan followed God&#39;s call to begin a feeding program and transform a barren hillside into a refuge and a school for 500 children. A medical clinic is nearing completion with future plans for a church, community center, and library. Megan has adopted four Haitian children and in 2013 she married her best friend, Josh Anderson.</p><h2>All Things Bright and Beautiful</h2><p>Two years ago when we published James Herriot's<i> All Creatures Great and Small</i>, we called it a "miracle between covers." In the first major review of the book, Alfred Ames said: "If there is any justice, <i>All Creatures Great and Small</i> will become a classic of its kind. The publishers call it a miracle-- not too strong a word for a book that offers something for everyone: gusto, humor, pathos, information, romance, insight, style. It is vicarious living with one of the happiest and most admirable of people, a veterinary surgeon in the Yorkshire dales who can write superlatively well."<br><br>James, the miracle worker, has done it again. <i>All Things Bright and Beautiful</i> is precisely the warm and joyful sequel that readers all over America have been asking for.

Information is divided into nine sections, beginning with &#x201c;Observing the Universe,&#x201d; which covers a definition of space, a history of viewing the stars, telescopes, and observatories. Other chapters include &#x201c;The Violent Universe,&#x201d; &#x201c;Solar System,&#x201d; &#x201c;Earth,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Moon,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Sun.&#x201d; &#x201c;Liftoff&#x201d; features information on space shuttles, satellites, and rockets. &#x201c;Humans in Space&#x201d; discusses our exploration of the universe (animals in space, space stations, and the future of space exploration). A final &#x201c;Stars and Stargazing&#x201d; section describes stars, other solar systems, and what you can see in the night sky. Within each section, topics are examined on two-page spreads featuring a typical DK layout: title, large-font introductory paragraph, several medium-sized-font paragraphs of supporting information, and numerous photographs with captions that provide additional details. Though there is plenty of detail to keep would-be astronauts engaged, the illustrative material is obviously the highlight of this volume. The stunning full-color photographs and visuals, courtesy of NASA and high-tech telescopes from around the world, show detail and clarity. This work will find popularity with space enthusiasts and browsers alike, although report writers will need additional research sources if focusing on only one topic. Because of the relatively low cost, public libraries will likely want more than one copy. Junior- and senior-high-schools where astronomy is studied will want to consider purchase for their library or science department.

It tells you -- and shows you in more than 1,200 illustrations -- what you need to know in order to be able to recognize the several distinct architectural styles and to understand their historical significance. What does that cornice mean? Or that porch? That door? When was this house built? What does its style say about the people who built it? You'll find the answers to such questions here.<br><br>This is how the book works: Each of thirty-nine chapters focuses on a particular style (and its variants). Each begins with a large schematic drawing that highlights the style's most important identifying features. Additional drawings and photographs depict the most common shapes and the principal subtypes, allowing you to see at a glance a wide range of examples of each style. Still more drawings offer close-up views of typical small details -- windows, doors, cornices, etc. -- that might be difficult to see in full-house pictures. The accompanying text is rich in information about each style -- describing in detail its identifying features, telling you where (and in what quantity) you're likely to find examples of it, discussing all of its notable variants, and revealing its origin and tracing its history.<br><br>In the book's introductory chapters you'll find invaluable general discussions of house-building materials and techniques ("Structure"), house shapes ("Form"), and the many traditions of architectural fashion ("Style") that have influenced American house design through the past three centuries. A pictorial key and glossary help lead you from simple, easily recognized architectural features -- the presence of a tile roof, for example -- to the styles in which that feature is likely to be found.</p><p>How to Use This Book<p>Preface</p><p>Looking at American Houses</p><p>Style: The Fashions of American Houses</p><p>Form: The Shapes of American Houses</p><p>Structure: The Anatomy of American Houses</p><p>Pictorial Key and Glossary</p><p>Folk Houses</p><p>Native American</p><p>Pre-Railroad</p><p>National</p><p>Colonial Houses (1600-1820)</p><p>Postmedieval English</p><p>Dutch Colonial</p><p>French Colonial</p><p>Spanish Colonial</p><p>Georgian</p><p>Adam</p><p>Early Classical Revival</p><p>Romantic Houses (1820-1880)</p><p>Greek Revival</p><p>Gothic Revival</p><p>Italianate</p><p>Exotic Revivals</p><p>Octagon</p><p>Victorian Houses (1860-1900)</p><p>Second Empire</p><p>Stick</p><p>Queen Anne</p><p>Shingle</p><p>Richardsonian Romanesque</p><p>Folk Victorian</p><p>Eclectic Houses (1880-1940)</p><p>Anglo-American, English, and French Period Houses</p><p>Colonial Revival</p><p>Neoclassical</p><p>Tudor</p><p>Chateauesque</p><p>Beaux Arts</p><p>French Eclectic</p><p>Mediterranean Period Houses</p><p>Italian Renaissance</p><p>Mission</p><p>Spanish Eclectic</p><p>Monterey</p><p>Pueblo Revival</p><p>Modern Houses</p><p>Prairie</p><p>Craftsman</p><p>Modernistic</p><p>International</p><p>American Houses Since 1940</p><p>Modern</p><p>Neoeclectic</p><p>Contemporary Folk</p><p>For Further Reference</p><p>Index</p>Virginia and Lee McAlester have both avocational and professional interests in architecture.

Congress divided itself between Northerners and Southerners, citizens on the frontier took up arms against one another, and movements for secession and abolition were more urgent than ever.</p><p>In <i>The Hammer and the Anvil</i>, the award-winning author Dwight Jon Zimmerman and the renowned artist Wayne Vansant vividly depict the tumultuous time through the lives of two men who defined it: Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>With a foreword by the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning historian James M. McPherson, <i>The</i> <i>Hammer and the Anvil </i>reveals that its protagonists each wrestled with the question of slavery from a young age. Douglass, a slave who was spared no brutality, once fought an especially cruel master and eventually escaped north to freedom. Lincoln, who was hired out by his father to do manual labor on neighbors' farms, found this harsh life intolerable. As a senator, Lincoln sought ways to end the westward spread of slavery, believing that adding free states to the Union would diminish the power of the Southern states and lead to the gradual disappearance of the "peculiar institution." Douglass was less patient. He had become a skilled orator and an influential editor of Northern abolitionist journals, and called on white Americans to honor their nation's founding commitment to liberty.</p><p>When the Civil War erupted in April 1861, Douglass hoped that the conflict would mean the end of slavery. But Lincoln delayed emancipation, and Douglass despaired&#x2015;until he met the president face-to-face and recognized that their causes were one and the same. Featuring evocative and dramatic scenes of this seminal time, <i>The Hammer and the Anvil </i>will engage both Civil War buffs and young people new to the study of American history.</p></p><p><p><b>Dwight Jon Zimmerman </b>is the coauthor with Bill O'Reilly of <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Lincoln's Last Days</i>.

Simply look at the dreams and desires written in the heart of every boy: To be a hero, to be a warrior, to live a life of adventure and risk. Sadly, most men abandon those dreams and desires-aided by a Christianity that feels like nothing more than pressure to be a "nice guy." It is no wonder that many men avoid church, and those who go are often passive and bored to death. In this provocative book, Eldredge gives women a look inside the true heart of a man and gives men permission to be what God designed them to be-dangerous, passionate, alive, and free.</p></p><p>If Christian men are going to change from a pitiful, wimpy bunch of "really nice guys" to men who are made in the image of God, they must reexamine their preconceptions about who God is and recover their true "wild" hearts, writes bestselling author John Eldredge in <i>Wild at Heart: Discovering a Life of Passion, Freedom, and Adventure</i>. Eldredge throws down the gauntlet--men are bored; they fear risk, they refuse to pay attention to their deepest desires. He challenges Christian men to return to authentic masculinity without resorting to a "macho man" mentality. Men often seek validation in venues such as work, or in the conquest of women, Eldredge observes. He urges men to take time out and come to grips with the "secret longings" of their hearts. Although the book succeeds best in its slant toward a male audience, it also strives to help women understand the implications of authentic masculinity in their relationships with men. Eldredge frames the book around his outdoor experiences and appealing anecdotes about his family, sprinkling the text with touches of humor and overlying everything with heartfelt passion. Even as he mixes eclectic ideas about masculinity from popular movies such as <i>Braveheart</i> with classic words from Oswald Chambers, and lyrics from the Dixie Chicks with stories from the Bible, he points to only one answer for men searching for their true wildness of heart. Writes Eldredge, "The only way to live in this adventure ... with all its danger and unpredictability and immensely high stakes ... is in an ongoing, intimate relationship with God." <i>--Cindy Crosby</i><p>John Eldredge is an author, a counselor, and a teacher. He is also president of Ransomed Heart, a ministry devoted to helping people discover the heart of God, recovering their own hearts in God&#x2019;s love, and learning to live in God&#x2019;s Kingdom.&nbsp;He lives near Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Walt Disney&#39;s Cinderella (Walt Disney&#39;s Classic Fairytale)</h2><p><br><i>This is a story about darkness and light, about sorrow and joy, about something lost and something found. This is a story about Love. </i><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Cinderella&#x2019;s story has been told over and over, but never has it been touched by the kind of magic found in this book. Mary Blair painted the original pictures for Walt Disney&#x2019;s incomparable animated film, and here her elegant art is gathered together as a picture book for the first time. Cynthia Rylant&#x2019;s stories about hardscrabble lives have won not only awards and honors, but hearts. Who better to take a young girl from the darkness of her garret room to the light and brilliance of a ballroom?<br><br>Together these two great artists have created something quite astonishing: a <i>Cinderella</i> that is breathtaking, heartrending, and joyous, both for those who are coming to the tale for the very first time, and for those who think they know it well. &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Cynthia Rylant has written more than 100 children's books, from board books and picture books, to chapter books and novels.

She also brought her distinctive, colorful style to children's books, advertisements, theatrical set designs, and theme park attractions.</p><h2>Nature in the Neighborhood</h2><p>Various plants and animals are presented in a simple nature book that captures the diversity of life in a typical neighborhood throughout the seasons of the year.</p><p>Gordon Morrison is a well-known naturalist whose work has been praised by Roger Tory Peterson as "Marvelous, beautiful, excellent . . . Morrison&#x2019;s work is so inspiring that I wish such clear material was available when I was slowly learning ecology. . . . We owe a debt of gratitude to Gordon for his interpretive skills as an artist. He is a superb teacher who uses visual methods." Robert Bateman likened his work to that of Albrecht Durer and Andrew Wyeth. Gordon Morrison makes his home in Massachusetts.<br>Grade 1-4&#x2013;While most books about habitats consider vast territories such as rain forests or tundra, Morrison calls attention to the workings of nature close to home. He focuses on plants and animals in a single neighborhood in an unnamed North American city, beginning in spring as the snow melts and following them through the seasons. A robin nests in a fire-alarm box. Weeds claim an empty lot. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed plants. Two detailed maps of the neighborhood help readers locate the sites described. Full-color illustrations and standard type move the narration along. Lower on the pages, tiny black-and-white drawings are accompanied by more detailed descriptions of the animals and plants as well as explanations of concepts such as habitat. This format expands the title's usefulness to a broader range of children, depending on their interest and reading ability. At times, however, the amount of information threatens to distract from the main account. Still, this offering could serve as a resource for nature study or community units and will encourage readers to observe and appreciate their own surroundings.<i>&#x2013;Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State University, Mankato</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Before the 2004 election, and during the ensuing months when many Americans were trying to understand how an administration marked by cronyism, disregard for the national budget, and poorly disguised self-interest had been reinstated, Goldberg traveled through the heartland of a country in the grips of a fevered religious radicalism: the America of our time. From the classroom to the mega-church to the federal court, she saw how the growing influence of dominionism-the doctrine that Christians have the right to rule nonbelievers-is threatening the foundations of democracy.<br><br> In <i>Kingdom Coming</i>, Goldberg demonstrates how an increasingly bellicose fundamentalism is gaining traction throughout our national life, taking us on a tour of the parallel right-wing evangelical culture that is buoyed by Republican political patronage. Deep within the red zones of a divided America, we meet military retirees pledging to seize the nation in Christ's name, perfidious congressmen courting the confidence of neo-confederates and proponents of theocracy, and leaders of federally funded programs offering Jesus as the solution to the country's social problems.<br><br> With her trenchant interviews and the telling testimonies of the people behind this movement, Goldberg gains access into the hearts and minds of citizens who are striving to remake the secular Republic bequeathed by our founders into a Christian nation run according to their interpretation of scripture. In her examination of the ever-widening divide between believers and nonbelievers, Goldberg illustrates the subversive effect of this conservative stranglehold nationwide. In an age when faith rather than reason is heralded and the values of the Enlightenment are threatened by a mystical nationalism claiming divine sanction, <i>Kingdom Coming</i> brings us face to face with the irrational forces that are remaking much of America.</p><p>Michelle Goldberg is a contributing editor at Religion Dispatches and a senior correspondent for American Prospect. Her work has appeared in Rolling Stone, the New York Observer, the Guardian [London], Newsday, and elsewhere. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<i>Starred Review.</i> In an impressive piece of lucid journalism, Salon.com reporter Goldberg dives into the religious right and sorts out the history and networks of what to most liberals is an inscrutable parallel universe. She deconstructs "dominion theology," the prevalent evangelical assertion that Christians have a "responsibility to take over every aspect of society." Goldberg makes no attempt to hide her own partisanship, calling herself a "secular Jew and ardent urbanite" who wrote the book because she "was terrified by America's increasing hostility to... cosmopolitan values." This carefully researched and riveting treatise will hardly allay its audience's fears, however; secular liberals and mainstream believers alike will find Goldberg's descriptions of today's culture wars deeply disturbing. She traces the deep financial and ideological ties between fundamentalist Christians and the Republican Party, and discloses the dangers she believes are inherent to the Bush administration's faith-based social services initiative. Other chapters follow inflammatory political tactics on wedge issues like gay rights, evolution and sex education. Significantly, her conclusions do not come off as hysterical or shrill. Even while pointing to stark parallels between fascism and the language of the religious right, Goldberg's vision of America's future is measured and realistic. Her book is a potent wakeup call to pluralists in the coming showdown with Christian nationalists.<i> (May 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She grows them all over her room - in pots, and crates, even in glass jars. <br>In this book, she takes you on a tour of her indoor garden. She tells you about her orange tree (and plantable pits and seeds, including melons, tomatoes, and grapes); she shows you how to take a cutting from a Busy Lizzie and how to trim an avocado plant. <br><br>And she teaches you what keeps plants satisfied: the art of watering properly (plants don't like standing with their feet in water) and fertilizing. And what to do when plants are attacked by whiteflies or other nasty bugs. <br><br>Linnea also makes garden-cress cheese (from homegrown cress, of course); discusses the pleasures and possible pitfalls of growing an amaryllis; and writes a plant newspaper, The Green Gazette. <br><br><i>Linnea's Windowsill Garden</i> will informs and inspire anyone who wants to grow an indoor garden of their own.<br></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: SwedishGrade 3-4 This is fun! Bjork offers a lively, chatty romp through indoor gardening with a grinning Linnea as guide, and a grandfatherly Mr. Bloom offering steady advice when needed. Activities with seeds, cuttings, bulbs, and pits range from the simple (planting lemon seeds in a peat pellet) to the complex (bringing an amaryllis bulb out of dormancy to bloom and back again). One of the best activities is mixing plaster of Paris with split pea seeds and observing which one will break out first (the winner swelled up and broke out in two hours). Possible problems and pests are discussed, and the recommended organic controls of the common insects likely to attack indoor plants are a good beginning for first-time gardeners. The drawings show exactly what the text says to do, plus they are charming. These activities are similar to the indoor plant activities found in Leutscher's Flowering Plants (Watts, 1984), but with more of them, plus recipes and trivia facts about gardening. Frances E.

Simultaneous.</p><p>This book is part of a series of guides designed for adolescents interested in natural history and nature. The books are an excellent introduction to the <i>Rocks and Minerals</i>, <i>Birds</i>, <i>Wildflowers</i>, and <i>Insects</i> for children aged 8-18. Each guide is appropriately sized to fit in a field vest pocket. Readers who remember previous versions of these field guides from the 1970s that were dull and overly detailed will be pleasantly surprised. These books are arguably the most beautifully photographed and laid out field guides yet published for young people. Each book has an introductory section filled with interesting facts, descriptions of early naturalists, definitions of many of the terms used in the book, and a guide to using the field guide portion of the book. Best of all, the books also come equipped with laminated field "cheat sheet" cards, for quick identification while on the go, in any kind of weather. Each field guide features 50 common species with photos and brief descriptions of many more regionally occurring birds. Brief discussions of threatened and endangered species are particularly valuable. Great first guides for children and adults with limited natural history background.<p> The </p>Grade 4 Up-Two welcome additions to nature study that are not strictly field guides per se. Beginning with descriptions of ornithology and entomology, the authors invite young people to become aware of and familiar with the natural world. With sharp, clear full-color photos (some spectacular, some disappointingly small), birds and insects are described, classified, and placed in their habitats. Birds covers identification marks; eating, mating, and nesting habits; migration; and endangered status. Insects provides similar information plus cautions against those insects that bite or sting. The photos greatly magnify the size of each species. Both volumes do include useful sections of photos for quick identification while on hikes, etc. A glossary of technical terms, lists for further reading, organizations, videos, software, and Web sites are appended. These inviting and easy-to-use titles will deservedly be popular.<br><i>Kathleen McCabe, East Meadow Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Stories of John Cheever</h2><p>Winner of the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.<br>THE STORIES OF JOHN CHEEVER live in the community of emotions and dreams.

Just an old photo and a few words on a small square of heavy stock, but when she saw it, she knew she was seeing her future.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was half a life ago. Now Lost Lake is about to slip into Eby's past. Her husband George is long passed. Most of her demanding extended family are gone. All that's left is a once-charming collection of lakeside cabins succumbing to the Southern Georgia heat and damp, and an assortment of faithful misfits drawn back to Lost Lake year after year by their own unspoken dreams and desires.<br>&nbsp;<br>It's a lot, but not enough to keep Eby from relinquishing &nbsp;Lost Lake to a developer with cash in hand, and calling this her final summer at the lake. Until one last chance at family knocks on her door.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lost Lake is where Kate Pheris spent her last best summer at the age of twelve, &nbsp;before she learned of loneliness, and heartbreak, and loss. Now she's all too familiar with those things, but she knows about hope too, thanks to her resilient daughter Devin, and her own willingness to start moving forward. Perhaps at Lost Lake her little girl can cling to her own childhood for just a little longer... and maybe Kate herself can rediscover something that slipped through her fingers so long ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>One after another, people find their way to Lost Lake, looking for something that they weren't sure they needed in the first place:&nbsp; love, closure, a second chance, peace, a mystery solved, a heart mended.&nbsp; Can they find&nbsp;what they need before it's too late?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>At once atmospheric and enchanting,&nbsp;<i>Lost Lake&nbsp;</i>shows Sarah Addison Allen at her finest, illuminating the secret longings and the everyday magic that wait to be discovered in the unlikeliest of places.</p><p><p>SARAH ADDISON ALLEN is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Garden Spells, The Sugar Queen, The Girl Who Chased the Moon,</i> and <i>The Peach Keeper</i>. She was born and raised in Asheville, North Carolina.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Atlanta, Georgia Present day <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>&#x201c;Wake up, Kate!&#x201d;</i> <br>And, exactly one year to the day that she fell asleep, Kate finally did. <br>She opened her eyes slowly and saw that a pale lavender moth had come to a rest on the back of her hand. She watched it from her pillow, wondering if it was real. It reminded her of her husband Matt&#x2019;s favorite T-shirt, which she&#x2019;d hidden in a bag of sewing, unable to throw it away. It had a large faded moth on the front, the logo of a cover band out of Athens called the Mothballs. <br>That T-shirt, that moth, always brought back a strange memory of when she was a child. She used to draw tattoos of butterflies on her arms with Magic Markers. She would give them names, talk to them, carefully fill in their colors when they started to fade. When the time came that they wanted to be set free, she would blow on them and they would come to life, peeling away from her skin and flying away. <br>She&#x2019;d always been a little different as a child, that strange girl who kept her imaginary friends well past the age of most children, the child people called a <i>free spirit</i> in a way meant to console her parents, as if, like a lisp, she would hopefully outgrow it. Her parents hadn&#x2019;t minded, though. As long as they&#x2019;d had each other, they&#x2019;d let Kate be as free as she wanted. <br>Kate thought about blowing on the lavender moth, to see what would happen, but before she could, her mother-in-law walked into her bedroom with a cup of coffee and a brisk, &#x201c;Good morning!&#x201d; When Kate looked again, the moth was gone. She sat up as Cricket threw open the curtains and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the big day. The movers are coming.&#x201d; <br>Kate felt vaguely panicked, like she was shaking off a nightmare she couldn&#x2019;t fully remember. &#x201c;Movers?&#x201d; <br>Cricket snapped her fingers in front of Kate&#x2019;s face as she handed Kate the cup of coffee. &#x201c;Yes, movers. You&#x2019;re moving into my house today. Did you take something to help you sleep last night?&#x201d; <br>She hadn&#x2019;t dreamed this. It was real. She looked to the left side of the mattress. Matt wasn&#x2019;t there. She could have sworn she&#x2019;d heard his voice, heard <i>someone&#x2019;s</i> voice. &#x201c;No. I don&#x2019;t take anything. You know that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re cranky this morning,&#x201d; Cricket said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good thing I got here early. I got Devin up and dressed and fixed her breakfast.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Devin&#x2019;s up? This is the first day of summer vacation,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s never up this early on vacation.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s best to keep her on a schedule. It makes going back to school in the fall so much easier, don&#x2019;t you think? She&#x2019;s in the attic. You&#x2019;ll keep an eye on her, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br>Kate could feel a strange heat along the back of her neck, something she hadn&#x2019;t felt in a while. It was almost exotic, like tasting turmeric or saffron after a year of eating pudding. There was a bite to it. <br>She was <i>annoyed.</i> <br>She was finally awake and annoyed. Of course she would keep an eye on Devin. For the past year she&#x2019;d made Devin dinner and attended school plays and chaperoned field trips and taken her to the eye doctor. She&#x2019;d been sleepwalking, but still, she&#x2019;d done it. Cricket had no reason to distrust Kate&#x2019;s ability to mother her own child. <br>Except for that one time. <br>There would always be that one time. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s such a mess up there,&#x201d; Cricket said, clicking around the bedroom in her Louboutin shoes, her smart black suit, and big immovable southern hair. She checked the closet for leftover clothes, to make sure Kate had packed everything. &#x201c;I thought I told you to go through the things in the attic and put what you wanted in the living room. Otherwise, it&#x2019;s just going to be left behind for the new owners to deal with. It&#x2019;s probably for the best not to let Devin take all those old clothes with her. We&#x2019;ll never get her out of them in the fall. I found her school uniform in the trash can this morning!&#x201d; <br>Kate put the cup of coffee on the floor beside the bed. Every day for a year Cricket had come by to take Devin to her new school, and she always made coffee while she was here, horrible, tar-black coffee that Kate hated. Kate didn&#x2019;t want to drink it anymore. It was such a small thing, to put the cup aside and not drink it, but as she watched Cricket&#x2019;s eyes take in the movement, Kate felt a small thrill from this first real act of rebellion since she&#x2019;d gone to sleep a year ago. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always told her she could wear whatever she wanted in the summer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We both know that&#x2019;s not a good idea, especially now that she&#x2019;s moving into my neighborhood.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Matt agreed with me,&#x201d; Kate said, his name unfamiliar on her tongue now, and it felt like saying something unspeakable, a curse. <br>Cricket turned away at the mention of her son&#x2019;s name. She didn&#x2019;t like to talk of him. Ever. She was holding him inside, captive within her rib cage, not willing to share her grief with anyone else. Not even with Kate, who wanted so badly to find pieces of affection for Matt in his mother, to be consoled in some way. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve let her get away with too much over the years. You&#x2019;re getting up now, aren&#x2019;t you? Because the movers will be here at noon. I can probably leave work around three. You know I&#x2019;d be here to help if it weren&#x2019;t for that big closing today. I&#x2019;ll see you at my house later this afternoon. Everything should go smoothly. I left a list. You&#x2019;re getting up now, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; she asked again. <br>Kate slowly stood, as if testing her balance. It felt strange. Her muscles felt weak. <br>Cricket turned in the doorway and stared at Kate. Kate had no idea what she was thinking. She never did. She was as unreadable as a lost language. &#x201c;Are you excited about coming to work in my office? We&#x2019;ll get your hair trimmed tomorrow. Would you like that?&#x201d; <br>Kate put her hand to her hair and felt a year&#x2019;s worth of choppy growth framing her face. <br>It had been exactly one year since Kate had picked up those scissors in the bathroom, after locking herself in after Matt&#x2019;s funeral. She&#x2019;d stared at them, the stainless steel winking in the noon light, and she&#x2019;d thought things she&#x2019;d never known she was capable of thinking&#x2014;dark, unforgivable things. But when she&#x2019;d lifted the scissors, she instead took her grief and frustration out on her long brown hair. With every snip of the scissors, clumps of her hair had fallen, and she&#x2019;d watched them turn into tiny birds that cawed and flew around her, swarming in a heavy circle. <br>Matt had loved her hair, and she&#x2019;d worn it long just for him. Kate had lived for the times when, as she was doing the books at the shop, Matt would casually walk by and slide the pencil holding up her hair, just to watch it cascade down her back. When they&#x2019;d made love, he&#x2019;d liked her on top, with her hair falling down around him, sticking to his skin. <br>Hours later, Cricket had found her on the bathroom floor. Cricket had gone to her knees in surprise, and Kate had cried, holding on to Cricket so tightly she was sure she&#x2019;d left bruises. Cricket had helped Kate clean up the places where she&#x2019;d nicked her scalp, and trimmed what she could so Kate wouldn&#x2019;t scare Devin. Cricket had made light of it for Devin, telling her that Kate just needed a hairstyle that was easier to take care of. <br>That had been the last day she&#x2019;d been awake. <br>Until now. <br>Cricket was waiting for her to answer. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;Thank you, Cricket. For everything.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you soon,&#x201d; she said, then turned to go. &#x201c;I have big plans to tell you about.&#x201d; <br>Kate listened to the sound of Cricket&#x2019;s heels as she walked down the hallway. <br>The opening and closing of the front door. <br>The sound of Cricket&#x2019;s car pulling out of the driveway. <br>Kate then hurried out of her room, trying to blink away the sleep and disorientation. <i>My God,</i> she thought, <i>this is really happening.</i> She went to the closet down the hall, where the folding stairs had already been pulled from the ceiling. <br>She climbed the ladder and emerged into the light from the single window in the attic. Dust motes floated around her like ash. Her eight-year-old daughter was humming as she plowed through the detritus of a large black trunk whose hinges were red with rust and the faded word MARILEE was stamped in gold on the lid. <br>Devin had grown in the year Kate had been asleep, grown in ways Kate was just now seeing. Her face was fuller, her legs were longer. Kate wanted to run to her and hold her, but Devin would think she was crazy. Devin had seen Kate just last night, when Kate had tucked her into bed. It hadn&#x2019;t been a year for her. Devin didn&#x2019;t know Kate had been asleep all this time. <br>So Kate just stood there and drank in the sight of her. Devin was the most gorgeous, unique creature Kate had ever known. She&#x2019;d come out of the womb an individual, refusing to be defined by anyone. She didn&#x2019;t even look like anyone on either side of their families. Matt&#x2019;s family was so proud of their dark hair, a blue-black that had been the envy of generations, the way it caught the sun like a spiderweb. From Kate&#x2019;s own side of the family, there was a gene that made their eyes so green that they could trick people into thinking that even the most unattractive Morris woman was pretty. And yet here was Devin, with fine cotton-yellow hair and light blue eyes, the left of which was a lazy eye. She&#x2019;d had to wear an eye patch when she was three. And she&#x2019;d loved it. She loved her knotted yellow hair. She loved wearing stripes with polka dots, and tutus, and pink and green socks with orange patent-leather shoes. Devin could care less what other people thought about her. <br>And that drove Cricket crazy. <br>How had Kate let this happen? How had she gotten to the point where she was slowly turning over control to the one person who wanted to change her daughter from the glorious thing she was? The very thing Kate used to be, that she used to be so <i>proud</i> of being? Kate swallowed before she felt she had the voice to say, &#x201c;Hey, kiddo. What are you doing?&#x201d; <br>Devin looked over her shoulder with a smile. &#x201c;Mom! Look. This one is my favorite,&#x201d; Devin said, pulling out a faded pink dress with a red plaid sash. The crinoline petticoat underneath was so old and stiff it made snapping sounds, like beads or fire embers. She dropped the dress over her head, over her clothes. It brushed the floor. &#x201c;When I&#x2019;m old enough for it to fit me, I&#x2019;m going to wear it with purple shoes,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;A bold choice,&#x201d; Kate said as Devin dove back into the trunk. The attic in Kate&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s house had always fascinated Devin with its promise of hidden treasures. When Kate&#x2019;s mother had been alive, she had let Devin eat Baby Ruth candy bars and drink grape soda and play in this old trunk full of dresses that generations of Morris women had worn to try entice rich men to marry them. Most of the clothes had belonged to Kate&#x2019;s grandmother Marilee, a renowned beauty who, like all the rest, had fallen in love with a poor man instead. <br>&#x201c;Who is Eby Pim?&#x201d; Devin suddenly asked. <br>&#x201c;Eby?&#x201d; Kate walked over Devin, measuring her steps, trying not to seem too eager. Devin had climbed inside the large trunk. The only part of her visible was the vintage green cap she was now wearing. It had a long dramatic feather pinned to it, and as she moved her head, the feather wrote invisible letters in the air. Kate sat on the floor beside the trunk, as close as she could. &#x201c;Eby was Grandmother Marilee&#x2019;s sister. My great-aunt. Your great-great-aunt. I only met her once, but I thought she was wonderful. Different. A little scandalous.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What did she do?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Eby married a man with money, and her family expected her to share all that money with them,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;But when they came back from their honeymoon, Eby and her husband suddenly decided to give all their money away. They sold their home in Atlanta and bought some swamp property down south. No one saw them for years and years. I was twelve the only time I met her. My mom and dad and I went to visit Eby after her husband died. There was a magical lake there where they&#x2019;d made a living renting out cabins. I think that was probably the last best summer I ever had.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can we go there?&#x201d; <br>Her voice was small as it came from the trunk. It made Kate close her eyes with emotion. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s still there. It was a long time ago. What made you ask about her?&#x201d; Kate asked. &#x201c;Is there something of hers in there?&#x201d; <br>Devin&#x2019;s hand appeared from the trunk, holding an old postcard. &#x201c;Just this postcard. It&#x2019;s addressed to you.&#x201d; <br>Kate took it. On one side were the vintage bubble words LOST LAKE, each letter large enough for a lake image to fit inside it. <br>Kate turned the card over. It was postmarked fifteen years ago, the last time Kate had seen Eby. <br> <i>Kate, I know you enjoyed yourself here and didn&#x2019;t want to leave. You&#x2019;re welcome to come back anytime you&#x2019;d like. I just wanted you to know. Love, Eby Pim</i> <br>It was the first time Kate had ever seen this. Her mother had never given it to her. She knew her mother and Eby had had a falling out that summer, but Kate never knew Eby had tried to contact her. <br>Devin got out of the trunk and started putting the dresses back in it. Some were so old that light shone through them, like ghost clothes. &#x201c;Can we take this trunk when we move in with Grandma Cricket?&#x201d; Devin asked, taking off the hat and dress she was wearing and putting them inside, then slowly closing and latching the lid. <br>Kate could tell that Cricket had already told Devin no. And that should have been that. Her mother-in-law was going to a great deal of trouble and expense to move Kate and Devin into her home in Buckhead. A year ago, after Matt had been hit and killed while cycling home from work, Cricket had swooped in and had suddenly become a part of their lives in a way she&#x2019;d never been when Matt was alive. And, in her sleep, Kate had made it so easy for her. She was no match for Cricket&#x2019;s money, even now, with the sale of this house and Matt&#x2019;s bike shop in Kate&#x2019;s bank account&#x2014;sales overseen by Cricket, who had so smoothly negotiated the deals, it was like she&#x2019;d put the buyers under a spell. In the back of Kate&#x2019;s mind rested a very real and persistent fear that Cricket could take Devin, if she really wanted to. She would always have that incident with the scissors as leverage. Kate should consider herself lucky that Cricket was taking her along with Devin, that Cricket was giving her a job answering phones in her real estate office. She should be grateful Cricket was giving them the entire third floor of her house, where Cricket could walk in and check on them anytime she liked, instead of coming all the way here every day to do it. <br>&#x201c;Of course we can take the trunk,&#x201d; Kate said, tucking the postcard into the chest pocket of her wrinkled nightshirt. &#x201c;We can take anything you want. Help me get it downstairs.&#x201d; <br>It wasn&#x2019;t heavy. But when it slid down the folding stairs, it nicked the floor a little. <br>They pulled the trunk into the living room, which was piled with boxes, suitcases, and some of their better furniture. <br>Kate saw Cricket&#x2019;s list taped to the upright box with Kate&#x2019;s clothes hung inside. Kate didn&#x2019;t even glance at the note as they scooted the trunk to the middle of the room. Even if she&#x2019;d still been asleep, she could have done this without consulting Cricket&#x2019;s list. It was moving, not rocket science. <br>She didn&#x2019;t know that it read: <br>1. The movers will be here at noon. Do not ride with them. Do not let Devin ride with them. <br>2. Wait exactly thirty minutes. Then drive to my house. Don&#x2019;t wear anything fancy or put on makeup. It might help to look a little sad. I want Devin to wear exactly what she has on. <br>3. This is very important. There will be a film crew waiting at my house.

Many believed Hill was innocent, condemned for his association with the Industrial Workers of the World -- the radical Wobblies. Now, following four years of intensive investigation, William M. Adler gives us the first full-scale biography of Joe Hill, and presents never before published documentary evidence that comes as close as one can to definitively exonerating him.Joe Hill&#39;s gripping tale is set against a brief but electrifying moment in American history, between the century&#39;s turn and World War I, when the call for industrial unionism struck a deep chord among disenfranchised workers; when class warfare raged and capitalism was on the run. Hill was the union&#39;s preeminent songwriter, and in death, he became organized labor&#39;s most venerated martyr, celebrated by Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, and immortalized in the ballad &#34;I Dreamed I Saw</p><p><p><b>William M.

SEASCAPE WITH FIGURES</b></p> <p>The five-mile promenade of Royale-les-Eaux, backed by trim lawns emblazoned at intervals with tricolour beds of salvia, alyssum and lobelia, was bright with flags and, on the longest beach in the north of France, the gay bathing tents still marched prettily down to the tide-line in big, money-making battalions. Music, one of those lilting accordion waltzes, blared from the loud-speakers around the Olympic-size piscine and, from time to time, echoing above the music, a man's voice announced over the public address system that Phil-ippe Bertrand, aged seven, was looking for his mother, that Yolande Lefevre was waiting for her friends below the clock at the entrance, or that a Madame Dufours was demanded on the telephone. From the beach, particularly from the neighbourhood of the three play-ground enclosures - 'Joie de Vivre', 'Helio' and 'Azur' - came a twitter of children's cries that waxed and waned with the thrill of their games and, farther out, on the firm sand left by the now distant sea, the shrill whistle of the physical-fitness instructor marshalled his teenagers through the last course of the day.</p> <p>It was one of those beautiful, naive seaside panoramas for which the Brittany and Picardy beaches have provided the setting - and inspired their recorders, Boudin, Tissot, Monet - ever since the birth of plages and bains de mer more than a hundred years ago.</p> <p>To James Bond, sitting in one of the concrete shelters with his face to the setting sun, there was something poignant, ephemeral about it all. It reminded him almost too vividly of childhood - of the velvet feel of the hot powder sand, and the painful grit of wet sand between young toes when the time came for him to put his shoes and socks on, of the precious little pile of sea-shells and interesting wrack on the sill of his bedroom window ('No, we'll have to leave that behind, darling. It'll dirty up your trunk!'), of the small crabs scuttling away from the nervous fingers groping beneath the seaweed in the rock-pools, of the swimming and swimming and swimming through the dancing waves -always in those days it seemed, lit with sunshine - and then the infuriating, inevitable 'time to come out'. It was all there, his own childhood, spread out before him to have another look at. What a long time ago they were, those spade-and-bucket days! How far he had come since the freckles and the Cadbury milk chocolate Flakes and the fizzy lemonade! Impatiently Bond lit a cigarette, pulled his shoulders out of their slouch and slammed the mawkish memories back into their long-closed file. Today he was a grown-up, a man with years of dirty, dangerous memories - a spy. He was not sitting in this concrete hideout to sentimentalise about a pack of scrubby, smelly children on a beach scattered with bottle-tops and lolly-sticks and fringed by a sea thick with sun-oil and putrid with the main drains of Royale. He was here, he had chosen to be here, to spy. To spy on a woman.</p> <p>The sun was getting lower. Already one could smell the September chill that all day had lain hidden beneath the heat. The cohorts of bathers were in quick retreat, striking their little camps and filtering up the steps and across the promenade into the shelter of the town where the lights were going up in the cafes. The announcer at the swimming-pool harried his customers: 'Allo! Allo! Fermeture en dix minutes! A dix-huit heures, fermeture de la piscine!' Silhouetted in the path of the setting sun, the two Bombard rescue-boats with flags bearing a blue cross on a yellow background were speeding northwards for their distant shelter up-river in the Vieux Port. The last of the gay, giraffe-like sand-yachts fled down the distant water-line towards its corral among the sand dunes, and the three agents cyclistes in charge of the car-parks pedalled away through the melting ranks of cars towards the police station in the centre of the town. In a matter of minutes the vast expanse of sand - the tide, still receding, was already a mile out - would be left to the seagulls that would soon be flocking in their hordes to forage for the scraps of food left by the picnickers. Then the orange ball of the sun would hiss down into the sea and the beach would, for a while, be entirely deserted, until, under cover of darkness, the prowling lovers would come to writhe briefly, grittily in the dark corners between the bathing-huts and the sea-wall.</p> <p>On the beaten stretch of sand below where James Bond was sitting, two golden girls in exciting bikinis packed up the game of Jokari which they had been so provocatively playing, and raced each other up the steps towards Bond's shelter. They flaunted their bodies at him, paused and chattered to see if he would respond, and, when he didn't, linked arms and sauntered on towards the town, leaving Bond wondering why it was that French girls had more prominent navels than any others. Was it that French surgeons sought to add, even in this minute respect, to the future sex-appeal of girl babies?</p> <p>And now, up and down the beach, the lifeguards gave a final blast on their horns to announce that they were going off duty, the music from the piscine stopped in mid-tune and the great expanse of sand was suddenly deserted.</p> <p>But not quite! A hundred yards out, lying face down-wards on a black and white striped bathing-wrap, on the private patch of firm sand where she had installed herself an hour before, the girl was still there, motion-less, spread-eagled in direct line between James Bond and the setting sun that was now turning the left-behind pools and shallow rivulets into blood-red, meandering scrawls across the middle distance. Bond went on watching her - now, in the silence and emptiness, with an ounce more tension. He was waiting for her to do something - for something, he didn't know what, to happen. It would be more true to say that he was watching over her. He had an instinct that she was in some sort of danger. Or was it just that there was the smell of danger in the air? He didn't know. He only knew that he mustn't leave her alone, particularly now that everyone else had gone.</p> <p>James Bond was mistaken. Not everyone else had gone. Behind him, at the Cafe de la Plage on the other side of the promenade, two men in raincoats and dark caps sat at a secluded table bordering the sidewalk. They had half-empty cups of coffee in front of them and they didn't talk. They sat and watched the blur on the frosted-glass partition of the shelter that was James Bond's head and shoulders. They also watched, but less intently, the distant white blur on the sand that was the girl. Their stillness, and their unseasonable clothes, would have made a disquieting impression on anyone who, in his turn, might have been watching them. But there was no such person, except their waiter who had simply put them in the category of 'bad news' and hoped they would soon be on their way.</p> <p>When the lower rim of the orange sun touched the sea, it was almost as if a signal had sounded for the girl. She slowly got to her feet, ran both hands backwards through her hair and began to walk evenly, purposefully towards the sun and the far-away froth of the water-line over a mile away. It would be violet dusk by the time she reached the sea and one might have guessed that this was probably the last day of her holiday, her last bathe.</p> <p>James Bond thought otherwise. He left his shelter, ran down the steps to the sand and began walking out after her at a fast pace. Behind him, across the promenade, the two men in raincoats also seemed to think otherwise. One of them briskly threw down some coins and they both got up and, walking strictly in step, crossed the promenade to the sand and, with a kind of urgent military precision, marched rapidly side by side in Bond's tracks.</p> <p>Now the strange pattern of figures on the vast expanse of empty, blood-streaked sand was eerily conspicuous. Yet it was surely not one to be interfered with! The pattern had a nasty, a secret smell. The white girl, the bare-headed young man, the two squat, marching pursuers - it had something of a kind of deadly Grand-mother's Steps about it. In the cafe, the waiter collected the coins and looked after the distant figures, still outlined by the last quarter of the orange sun. It smelt like police business - or the other thing. He would keep it to himself but remember it. He might get his name in the papers.</p> <p>James Bond was rapidly catching up with the girl. Now he knew that he would get to her just as she reached the waterline. He began to wonder what he would say to her, how he would put it. He couldn't say, 'I had a hunch you were going to commit suicide so I came after you to stop you.' 'I was going for a walk on the beach and I thought I recognised you. Will you have a drink after your swim?' would be childish. He l finally decided to say,' Oh, Tracy!' and then, when she turned round, 'I was worried about you.' Which would at least be inoffensive and, for the matter of that, true.</p> <p>The sea was now gunmetal below a primrose horizon. A small, westerly offshore breeze, drawing the hot land-air out to sea, had risen and was piling up wavelets that scrolled in whitely as far as the eye could see. Flocks of herring gulls lazily rose and settled again at the girl's approach, and the air was full of their mewing and of the endless lap-lap of the small waves. The soft indigo dusk added a touch of melancholy to the empty solitude of sand and sea, now so far away from the comforting bright lights and holiday bustle of 'La Reine de la Cote Opale', as Royale-les-Eaux had splendidly christened herself. Bond looked forward to getting the girl back to those bright lights. He watched the lithe golden figure in the white one-piece bathing-suit and wondered how soon she would be able to hear his voice above the noise of the gulls and the sea. Her pace had slowed a fraction as she approached the water-line and her head, with its bell of heavy fair hair to the shoulders, was slightly bowed, in thought perhaps, or tiredness.</p> <p>Bond quickened his step until he was on...</p></p><h2>Russia and the Russians: A History</h2><p><p> From the Carpathians in the west to the Greater Khingan range in the east, a huge, flat expanse dominates the Eurasian continent. Here, over more than a thousand years, the history and destiny of Russia have unfolded. In a sweeping narrative, one of the English-speaking world's leading historians of Russia follows this story from the first emergence of the Slavs in the historical record in the sixth century C.E. to the Russians' persistent appearances in today's headlines. Hosking's is a monumental story of competing legacies, of an enormous power uneasily balanced between the ideas and realities of Asian empire, European culture, and Byzantine religion; of a constantly shifting identity, from Kievan Rus to Muscovy to Russian Empire to Soviet Union to Russian Federation, and of Tsars and leaders struggling to articulate that identity over the centuries. </p><p> With particular attention to non-Russian regions and ethnic groups and to Russia's relations with neighboring polities, Hosking lays out the links between political, economic, social, and cultural phenomena that have made Russia what it is--a world at once familiar and mysterious to Western observers. In a clear and engaging style, he conducts us through the Mongol invasions, the rise of autocracy, the reigns of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great, the battle against Napoleon, the emancipation of the serfs, the Crimean War, the Bolshevik Revolution, Stalin's reign of terror, the two World Wars, the end of the USSR, to today's war against Chechnya. Hosking's history is shot through with the understanding that becoming an empire has prevented Russia from becoming a nation and has perpetuated archaic personal forms of power. This book is the most penetrating and comprehensive account yet of what such a legacy has meant--to Russia, and to the world. </p></p><p>Geoffrey Hosking is retired Professor of Russian History at the University College London.A book intended for a general educated audience and students, a survey of the entire course of Russian history. Hosking is up on the current literature and is invariably judicious in dealing with historiographical controversies.<br> --Terence Emmons, Stanford University<br><br>Hosking's book has comprehensive sweep and a clear writing style.

But they can't explain how Dr. Kay Scarpetta finds Waddell's fingerprints on <i>another</i> crime scene -- <i>after</i> she'd performed his autopsy. If this is some sort of game, Scarpetta seems to be the target. And if the next victim is someone she knows, the punishment will be cruel and unusual...</p><p>8 1.5-hour cassettes11:05 P.M. Convicted murderer Ronnie Joe Waddell is pronounced dead in the Commonwealth of Virginia&#39;s electric chair. In the morgue, Dr. Kay Scarpetta has been waiting for Waddell&#39;s body. It&#39;s a strange feeling, preparing for an autopsy before the subject is dead. But Scarpetta&#39;s been here before. As Virginia&#39;s chief medical examiner, she knows the tension of watching the clock as the execution hour draws near. Waddell&#39;s death isn&#39;t the only newsworthy event on this cold December night. Three hours after thirteen-year-old Eddie Heath goes out to a convenience store to buy a can of soup, his nude, grotesquely wounded body is found propped against a dumpster. Waddell&#39;s execution, the attack on Eddie - the two events seem unrelated until Scarpetta and Richmond police lieutenant Pete Marino remember that Waddell arranged his victim in a strikingly similar position to Eddie&#39;s. And then there&#39;s a new murder, the most puzzling of all. The crime scenes yield few clues: old bloodstains, fragments of feather, and - most baffling - a bloody fingerprint that points Scarpetta to the one suspect who could not possibly have committed this murder. And somewhere in Virginia&#39;s corridors of power, perhaps even in her own office, lurks an enemy who will destroy Scarpetta unless she can produce the proof that will clear her name. With some help from her seventeen-year-old niece, computer whiz Lucy, as well as from her loyal friend Lieutenant Marino and FBI agent Benton Wesley, Scarpetta musters all her forensic expertise and investigative skills to uncover shocking secrets that will have vast repercussions.

This is also an origin story of sorts, because how he met Ariana is also tied up with the story of the witch, his grandmother, who held Samuel and his father for such a long time. I have to say that if it had not been for the constant requests for this story, I, usually a teller of happier tales, would have left this one alone.</p><p>As a historical note&#x2014;and for those who need to know how old Samuel and Bran are&#x2014;Christianity came to Wales very early, perhaps as early as the first or second century with the Romans. When exactly the events of this novella took place, neither Samuel nor Bran could tell me. Bran just smiled like a boy without cares&#x2014;so I knew it hurt him to remember&#x2014;and said, &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t pay attention to time that way. Not then.&#x201d; Samuel told me, &#x201c;When you get just so old, those first days blur together.&#x201d; I am not a werewolf, but I can, after all this time, tell when Samuel is lying to me.</p><p>I do know that the events in this story happen a long, long time before Moon Called.<br><br><b>ONE</b></p><p>Three weeks to the day after I buried my youngest child, and several days after I buried my oldest&#x2014;a young woman who would never become older&#x2014;someone knocked at my door.</p><p>I rolled off my sleeping mat to my feet but made no move to answer the knock. It was pitch-dark outside, and the only reason anyone knocked at my door in the middle of the night was because someone was ill. All of my knowledge of herb lore and healing had not been able to save my wife or my children. If someone was ill, they were better off without me.</p><p>&#x201c;I can hear you,&#x201d; said my da&#x2019;s voice gruffly. &#x201c;Let me in.&#x201d;</p><p>Another day, before the death of my family, I would have been surprised. It had been a long time since I&#x2019;d heard my father&#x2019;s voice. But my da, he&#x2019;d always known when I was in trouble. That insight had outlasted my childhood.</p><p>I was beyond caring about anything, expected or unexpected. Being used to doing what he asked, I opened the door and stepped back.</p><p>The man standing outside entered quickly, careful not to lose the heat of the evening&#x2019;s fire. The hearth in the center of my home was banked and covered for the night, and I wouldn&#x2019;t fuel it again until the morning. With the door shut, the room was too dark to see because the window openings were also covered against the cold night air.</p><p>I did not see how he did it because there was no sound of striking flint, but he lit the tallow candle. He had always kept a candle on the ledge, just inside the door, where one of the rocks that formed the walls of the house stuck out. After he had gone and left the hut to me, I found it practical to leave one there as well.</p><p>In that dim but useful light, he pulled down the hood of his tattered cloak, and I saw his lined face, which looked older and more weather-beaten than when I&#x2019;d last seen him, a dozen or more seasons ago.</p><p>His hair was threaded through with hoary gray, and his beard was an unfamiliar snow-white. He moved with a limp that he hadn&#x2019;t had the last time I&#x2019;d seen him, but other than that he looked good for an old man. He set down the big pack he carried on his back and the leather bag that held his pipes. He shrugged off his outerwear and hung it up beside the door where my da had always hung such things.</p><p>&#x201c;The crows told me that you needed me,&#x201d; he said to my silence.</p><p>He seldom spoke of uncanny things, my da, and only to the family&#x2014;which was down to just me, as my younger brother had died four years ago of a wasting sickness. But Da was better at predicting things and knowing things than the hedge witch who held sway in our village. He also had an easier time lighting fires or candles than any other person I knew, wet wood, poor tinder, or untrimmed wick&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t matter to him.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how you can help,&#x201d; I told him, my voice harsh from lack of use. &#x201c;They are all dead. My wife, my children.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked down, and I knew that it wasn&#x2019;t news to him, that the crows&#x2014;or whatever magic had spoken to him&#x2014;had told him about their deaths.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;it was time for me to come.&#x201d; He looked up and met my eyes, and I could see the worry in his face. &#x201c;Though I thought that I ran ahead of trouble, not behind.&#x201d;</p><p>The words should have sent a chill down my spine, but I foolishly believed that the worst thing that could happen to me already had.</p><p>&#x201c;How long are you staying?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>He tilted his head as if he heard something that I did not. &#x201c;For the winter,&#x201d; he told me at last, and I tried not to feel relief that I would not be alone. I tried not to feel anything but grief. My family deserved my grief&#x2014;and I, who had failed to save them, did not deserve to feel relief.</p><p>� � �</p><p>It was a harsh winter, as if nature herself mourned with me. My da, he didn&#x2019;t get in the way of my grieving, but he did make sure I got up every morning and did the things that were needful to get through the day. He didn&#x2019;t push, just watched me until I did the right thing. A man worked, and he tended those things that needed tending&#x2014;I knew those lessons from my childhood. He wasn&#x2019;t a man people gainsaid, and that was as true of me as it was the rest of the village.</p><p>People came by to greet him. Some of the attention was because he&#x2019;d been respected and liked, but more was because he could be coaxed to play for them. Music wasn&#x2019;t uncommon in our village, most folk sang and played a little drum or pipe. But most folk didn&#x2019;t sing like my da. When my mother died, no one had been surprised when he&#x2019;d taken back to traveling, singing for his room and board, as he&#x2019;d been doing when he first met her.</p><p>People brought him a little of whatever they had to pay for his music, and between that and the medicine I traded in barter, we had enough for winter stores even though I hadn&#x2019;t put things back as I usually did. I hadn&#x2019;t been worried about whether there was enough food to eat or enough wood to burn.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t worried about myself because I&#x2019;d have as soon joined my little family in their cold graves. With my da here, that route now smacked of cowardice&#x2014;and if I forgot that sometimes, my da&#x2019;s cool gaze reminded me.</p><p>It felt odd, though, not to have someone to take care of; for so long I had been the head of the family. I was not in the habit of worrying about my da: he wasn&#x2019;t the kind of person who needed anyone to fuss over him. He&#x2019;d survived his childhood&#x2014;not that he&#x2019;d spoken of it to me beyond that it had been rough. But my ma, she&#x2019;d known whatever it had been, and it had sparked fierce pride tinged with sorrow and tenderness. I knew only that he&#x2019;d left his home while still a stripling boy. He had traveled and thrived in a world hostile to strangers.</p><p>He was tough, and it gave him confidence that had backed down my ma&#x2019;s folk when they objected to her marrying a man from outside the village. He was smart&#x2014;and more than that, he was wise. When he spoke on village matters, which he didn&#x2019;t do often, the villagers listened to him.</p><p>He&#x2019;d survived traveling the world after my mother&#x2019;s death&#x2014;and he was still lit with the joy that made my home warmer than the logs on the hearth, though the chill left by the death of my little ones and their ma was deep.</p><p>My da, he could survive anything, and his example forced me to do the same. Even when I didn&#x2019;t want to.<br><br><b>TWO</b></p><p>On the shortest night of the year, when the full moon hung in the sky, my grandmother came to us. I&#x2019;d returned to my duties as village healer, so I didn&#x2019;t even think of not answering a knock in the dead of night. Da had gotten used to the middle-of-the-night summonses that were the lot of a healer. He didn&#x2019;t stir, though I was certain he was awake.</p><p>I opened the door to a stranger. She was a wild-looking young woman with hair that flowed in unkempt, tangled tresses all the way to the back of her knees. Her face was uncanny and so beautiful that I didn&#x2019;t pay much heed to the beast that crouched beside her, huge though he was.</p><p>&#x201c;The son,&#x201d; she said to me. The magic flows strongly in you. Her voice echoed in my head.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said my da, who had exploded to his feet the moment I opened the door. He stepped between us. &#x201c;You will not have him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t have run away,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;But I forgive you because you brought a gift with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will never willingly serve you, Mother,&#x201d; my da said in a voice I&#x2019;d never heard from him before. &#x201c;I told you we are done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You speak as though I would give you a choice,&#x201d; she said. She glanced down, and the beast I had taken for a dog lunged at my da.</p><p>I grabbed the cudgel I kept beside the door, but the beast was faster than I was. It had time to bury its fangs in my da&#x2019;s gut and jerk him between us. The only reason I didn&#x2019;t brain Da was because I dropped the cudgel midswing. And after that, there was no chance to fight.</p><p>� � �</p><p>She turned us into monsters&#x2014;werewolves&#x2014;though I didn&#x2019;t hear that term for many years. She bound us to her service with witchcraft and more cruelly through her ability to break into our minds&#x2014;in this she had more trouble with Da than with the rest of her wolves. Though she looked like a young woman to all of my senses, I think she was centuries old when she came knocking on my door.</p><p>The first transformation from human to werewolf is harsh under the best of circumstances. I now know that most people attacked brutally enough to be Changed die. The witch had some way to interfere, to hold her victims to life until they became the beasts she desired. Even so, I would have died if my da had not anchored me. I heard his voice in my head, cool and demanding, and I had to obey him, had to live. That he was able to do this while undergoing a like fate to mine is a fair insight into the man my da is. That I lived was something that took me a very long time to forgive him for.</p><p>I do not know, nor do I wish to, how long I lived as a werewolf serving my grandmother. It could have been a decade or centuries, though I think it was closer to the latter than the former. It was long enough that I had time to forget my given name. I deliberately left it behind because I was no longer that person, but I had not thought to lose it altogether. My name was not the only memory I lost.</p><p>I no longer remembered my first wife&#x2019;s face or the faces of my children. Though sometimes in dreams, even all these centuries later, I hear the cry of &#x201c;Taid! Taid!&#x201d; as a child calls for his father. The voice, I believe, is that of my firstborn son. In the dream, he is lost, and I cannot find him no matter where I look.</p><p>My da likes to say that sometimes forgetfulness is a gift. Perhaps had I remembered them clearly, remembered what I&#x2019;d once had, I would not have survived my time serving the witch. I learned to live in the moment, and the wolf who shared my body and soul made it easy: a beast feels no remorse for the past nor hope for the future.<br><br><b>THREE</b></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a fair maiden of the faerie courts who rode away from a hunting party, chasing something she could glimpse just ahead of her. Eventually she came to a glade where a strange and handsome man awaited her with food and drink. She ate the food and drank his wine and stayed with the lord of the forest even when the rest of her people found her, sending them back to the court without her.</p><p>Time passed, and she gave birth to a girl child who grew up as talented as she was wise. In a human tale, this couple would have had a happily-ever-after ending. But the fae are not human, and they live a very, very long time. Happily-ever-after is seldom long enough for them, and that was true for these two lovers. But for a time they were as happy as any.</p><p>They called their daughter Ariana, which means silver, as she early on had an affinity for that metal. As she grew up, it became apparent that her power harked back to the height of fae glory. By the time she reached adulthood, her power outshone even the forest lord&#x2019;s, and he was centuries old and steeped with the magic of the forest.</p><p>It is true that the high-court fae were notoriously fickle. It is also true that a forest lord has two aspects: the first is civilized and beautiful as any of the Tuatha D� Danann, the second is wild as the forest he rules. The sidhe lady eventually grew bored, or perhaps her distaste for her lover&#x2019;s wilder half became too strong. Whatever the reason, she left her grown daughter and her lover without a farewell or notice, to return to the court.</p><p>The forest lord mourned his lover only briefly, for his kind, too, are as light in their affections as they are terrible in their hatreds. For a while after she left, he still loved his daughter and took joy in her. But when her power eclipsed his own, he grew jealous and spiteful. When the other fae took notice of her gifts and came to her with gold and jewels to entice her to share her magic, his jealousy outgrew his love and made it as nothing.<br><br><b>FOUR</b></p><p>The pack customarily bedded down in the woods behind the witch&#x2019;s cottage. It was mountainous there, but not particularly cold, though winter still held snow and autumn a fine frost. Our coats were thick, and the interior of the cottage was smoky, too warm, and reeked unpleasantly of rotting things both physical and spiritual.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know about my da or the others, but I was happy to be out of the witch&#x2019;s way as much as possible. She kept us hidden from those who sought her services, both as unseen protection&#x2014;because she dealt with powerful and dread beings&#x2014;and as a precaution because she only mostly controlled us. My da she never let too near her unless she had some of the other, more obedient wolves nearby.</p><p>� � �</p><p>My father, curled up by himself, raised his head as I came back from hunting. He stood and gave me a look before turning and trotting off into the woods where the leaves were ruddy and gold. I hesitated, but even then, the obedience was a part of our relationship. Instead of settling down to sleep until morning as I had planned, I stretched twice, then ran in his trail until I caught up. Though I didn&#x2019;t look behind me, I knew that the others followed&#x2014;as they always did.</p><p>At first I thought the other wolves followed us to spy for the witch, but time had proven that wrong. There were six of us werewolves, seven really, though we all knew that Adda was dying&#x2014;he had trouble stumbling down the trail into the hollow, and I would have to help him up it when we returned.</p><p>I had the impression that my father had known some of the wolves from his childhood, but he never confirmed or denied it. He never spoke to them or of them when we were in human form&#x2014;and they never left their wolf shape.</p><p>Da had found a small sheltered hollow in the lee of a downed oak shortly after the witch had brought us here. It served to keep us hidden and offered some protection from the weather for our naked bodies. Even though my human skin didn&#x2019;t get cold as it had before the wolf entered my soul, skin was not as good as fur. It wasn&#x2019;t winter yet, but the leaves had begun to change to autumn&#x2019;s colors, and there was a bite to the air.</p><p>Da began his change as soon as we were in the oak&#x2019;s protection, but instead of following his example as I usually did, I hesitat...</p></p><h2>Carrot Cake Murder (Hannah Swenson Mysteries with Recipes)</h2><p>Murder comes to town when, during her business partner&#39;s family reunion, a long-lost uncle is found dead with two slices of Hannah&#39;s infamous carrot cake next to his body, a discovery that soon becomes a recipe for disaster.

In his international bestsellers <i>The Tao of Physics</i> and <i>The Turning Point,</i> he juxtaposed physics and mysticism to define a new vision of reality. In <i>The Web of Life,</i> Capra takes yet another giant step, setting forth a new scientific language to describe interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena--the "web of life."<br>During the past twenty-five years, scientists have challenged conventional views of evolution and the organization of living systems and have developed new theories with revolutionary philosophical and social implications. Fritjof Capra has been at the forefront of this revolution. In <i>The Web of Life,</i> Capra offers a brilliant synthesis of such recent scientific breakthroughs as the theory of complexity, Gaia theory, chaos theory, and other explanations of the properties of organisms, social systems, and ecosystems. Capra's surprising findings stand in stark contrast to accepted paradigms of mechanism and Darwinism and provide an extraordinary new foundation for ecological policies that will allow us to build and sustain communities without diminishing the opportunities for future generations.<br>Now available in paperback for the first time, <i>The Web of Life</i> is cutting-edge science writing in the tradition of James Gleick's <i>Chaos,</i> Gregory Bateson's <i>Mind and Matter,</i> and Ilya Prigogine's <i>Order Out of Chaos.</i><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>Fritjof Capra</b>, PhD, physicist and systems theorist, is a founding director of the Center for Ecoliteracy in Berkeley, California.

But Karpov has reached out from the grave with an unstoppable cyber operation he conceived before his murder, aimed at the heart of the United States--a way to steal the president's nuclear launch codes. Who has taken over the operation? Karpov trusted only one man: Jason Bourne. But can Bourne be working against his own country? The U.S. Government is convinced of his treason, and is doing everything in its power to kill him. Flushed from cover and gravely wounded, Bourne's only hope is to join forces with his bitterest enemy: a powerful Somali terrorist named Keyre, and his prot�g�e, the Angelmaker. If he hopes to survive, Bourne has no choice but unravel the mystery of Karpov's last legacy--a weaponized code that may bring about the unthinkable: a violent end to America.</p><p>ROBERT LUDLUM was the author of twenty-seven novels, each one a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller.

It stars the legendary Cohen. He&#39;s been a legend in his own lifetime. He can remember when a hero didn&#39;t have to worry about fences and lawyers and civilisation, and when people didn&#39;t tell you off for killing dragons. But he can&#39;t always remember, these days, where he put his teeth ...So now, with his ancient sword and his new walking stick and his old friends -- and they&#39;re very old friends -- Cohen the Barbarian is going on one final quest. He&#39;s going to climb the highest mountain in the Discworld and meet his gods. The last hero in the world is going to return what the first hero stole. With a vengeance. That&#39;ll mean the end of the world, if no one stops him in time.</p><p>A new Discworld story is always an event. Terry Pratchett's <i>The Last Hero</i> is unusually short, a 40,000-word "Discworld Fable" rather than a full novel, but is illustrated throughout in sumptuous color by Paul Kidby.<p> The 160 pages cover the series' longest and most awesome (but still comic) journey yet, a mission to save all Discworld from a new threat. An old threat, actually. Aged warrior Cohen the Barbarian has decided to go out with a bang and take the gods with him. So, with the remnants of his geriatric Silver Horde, he's climbing to the divine retirement home Dunmanifestin with the Discworld equivalent of a nuke--a fifty-pound keg of Agatean Thunder Clay.</p><p> This will, for excellent magical reasons, destroy the world.</p><p> It's up to Leonard of Quirm, Discworld's da Vinci, to invent the technology that might just beat Cohen to his goal. His unlikely vessel is powered by dragons, crewed by himself and two popular regular characters, and secretly harbors a stowaway. Before long we hear the Discworld version of "Houston, we have a problem...."</p><p> Kidby rises splendidly to the challenge of painting both funny faces and cosmic vistas. As Pratchett puts it, <i>The Last Hero</i> "has an extra dimension: some parts of it are written in paint!" New characters include Evil Dark Lord Harry Dread, who started out with "just two lads and his Shed of Doom," and a god so tiresome that his worshippers are forbidden chocolate, ginger, mushrooms <i>and</i> garlic.</p><p> Pratchett's story alone is strong and effective, with several hair-raising <i>frissons</i> contrasting with high comedy; Kidby's paintings make it something very special. Not to be missed. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Terry Pratchett is a publishing phenomenon. He is the bestselling British author ever, accounts for 1% of national book sales, is the most shoplifted author and sells around the world. Every Discworld novel since SOURCERY has been a Number One bestseller. Paul Kidby is Pratchett&#39;s Discworld artist of choice. He has illustrated all the Diaries and has contributed to a number of Calendars. He has provided the jacket illustrations for a number of Discworld projects, including THE SCIENCE OF DISCWORLD 2.</p><h2>Traditional Jewelry of India</h2><p>Far more than merely a display of wealth and taste, jewelry is an integral element in the lives of the people of India. Drawing on more than 35 years of collecting and research, Untracht surveys the major Indian jewelry forms and techniques, exploring Indian jewelry as both an ongoing aesthetic spanning 5,000 years and a highly significant form of cultural expression. 870 illustrations, 220 in color.</p><p><b>Oppi Untracht</b> lives in Finland and lectures and writes on traditional Indian jewelry and culture.Following Untracht as he discusses all the permutations and features of Indian jewelry is much like browsing through a <i>National Geographic</i> magazine or two. The pictures and captions catch the eye, but it is the text--nonscholarly, spritely prose--that truly educates and informs. And the author, through years of residency, research, and lectures, prepares all for a thorough backgrounding in a much neglected subject. He begins well before the establishment of goldsmithery, examining the body decorations of Bengal Bay islanders as well as the religious ornaments of various regional peoples. Then, in much-illustrated detail, come chapters on the tradition of entire-body decoration, actual examples and explanations of meanings, the use of gold and silver and gemstones, three specific centuries of artistry (the Mughal dynasty), and the interchange between and cross-cultural influences of European and Indian jewelry design. A wondrous collection of data and visuals documenting 5,000 continuous years of jewelry design. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>The Stone Monkey: A Lincoln Rhyme Novel (Lincoln Rhyme Novels)</h2><p>Hired to track a cargo ship carrying illegal immigrants and a notorious smuggler known as the &#34;Ghost,&#34; Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs find themselves in a race against time to prevent their target from killing off two families in New York City&#39;s Chinese community. 250,000 first printing.</p><p>When a vicious smuggler known as the Ghost scuttles a ship filled with undocumented Chinese immigrants less than a mile from New York harbor, only a handful of survivors--and the Ghost himself--manage to escape the burning vessel. Lincoln Rhyme, the quadriplegic NYPD forensic detective first introduced in 1997's <i>The Bone Collector</i>, and Amelia Sachs, his partner and lover, must stop the Ghost before he murders the two families who made it to shore. The families have gone to ground in the all but impenetrable world of Manhattan's Chinatown, a fact that makes the pair's two allies--Sonny Li, a Chinese cop, and Dr. John Sung-- invaluable partners.<p> The group's race against time showcases Jeffery Deaver's many talents, particularly intricate plotting, plenty of surprising twists, and breakneck pacing. This is a real standout from a writer whose previous thrillers have earned him a solid following among mystery fans. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>Jeffery Deaver</b> is the bestselling author of seventeen suspense novels, including <i>The Bone Collector,</i> which was made into a feature film by Universal Pictures.

Cooked in a crockpot overnight and combining specific grains, vegetables, meats, eggs, or various Chinese herbs, there are medicinal porridges for every type of ailment. Included are hundreds of herbal porridge recipes for both prevention and remedial purposes. This book is great for laypersons as well as professional readers.</p><p>Although this style of eating has been common in Asia for millennia, it is a new idea in the West and one from which we can learn a great deal.When I was studying Chinese medicine in China, I loved to eat traditional Chinese breakfasts centered around the kinds of porridges described in this book. They tasted great and I felt wonderful. As a professional practitioner of Chinese medicine, my patients often tell me that breakfast is their most problematic meal. Once one knows how easy to make and how good for you Chinese congees are, breakfast can be the foundation of the entire day&#39;s health rather than its ruination.</p><h2>Live or Die</h2><p>A collection of poems arranged chronologically to create vivid, autobiographical impressions and images of melancholy</p><p></p><h2>Burnhams Celestial Handbook, Vol.3</h2><p>All three volumes of Burnham&#39;s Celestial Handbook.

Although lighter and more melodramatic in tone than its predecessor, <i>Affinity</i>, this hypnotic suspense novel is awash with all manner of gloomy Dickensian leitmotifs: pickpockets, orphans, grim prisons, lunatic asylums, "laughing villains," and, of course, "stolen fortunes and girls made out to be mad." Divided into three parts, the tale is narrated by two orphaned girls whose lives are inextricably linked. Waters's penchant for byzantine plotting can get a bit exhausting, but even at its densest moments--and remember, this is smoggy London circa 1862--it remains mesmerizing. A damning critique of Victorian moral and sexual hypocrisy, a gripping melodrama, and a love story to boot, this book ingeniously reworks some truly classic themes. <i>--Travis Elborough, Amazon.co.uk</i><b>Sarah Waters&nbsp;</b>is the<i>&nbsp;New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Paying Guests</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Little Stranger</i>,<i>The Night Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fingersmith</i>,<i>&nbsp;Affinity</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Tipping the Velvet</i>.&nbsp;She&nbsp;has three times been short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, has twice been a finalist for the Orange Prize, and was&nbsp;named one of&nbsp;<i>Granta</i>&#x2019;s best&nbsp;young British&nbsp;novelists, among other distinctions.

This book reveals how this miraculous healing agent works, and why the medical establishment wants to suppress it.</p><p>Dr. Douglass reveals medical truths, and deceptions, often at risk of being labeled heretical. He is consumed by a passion for living a long healthy life, and wants his readers to share that passion. Their health and well-being comes first. He is anti-dogmatic, and unwavering in his dedication to improve the quality of life of his readers. He has been called "the conscience of modern medicine," a "medical maverick," and has been voted "Doctor of the Year" by the National Health Federation. His medical experiences are far reaching-from battling malaria in Central America - to fighting deadly epidemics at his own health clinic in Africa - to flying with U.S. Navy crews as a flight surgeon - to working for 10 years in emergency medicine in the United States. This dedicated physician has repeatedly gone far beyond the call of duty in his work to spread the truth about alternative therapies. For a full year, he endured economic and physical hardship to work with physicians at the Pasteur Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, where advanced research on photoluminescence was being conducted. These learning experiences, not to mention his keen storytelling ability and wit, make Dr. Douglass' newsletters (Daily Dose and Real Health) and all of his books uniquely interesting and fun to read. He shares his no-frills, no-bull approach to health care, often amazing his readers by telling them to ignore many widely-hyped good-health practices (like staying away from red meat, avoiding coffee, and eating like a bird), and start living again by eating REAL food, taking some inexpensive supplements, and doing the pleasurable things that make life livable. Readers get all this, plus they learn how to burn fat, prevent cancer, boost libido, and so much more. And, Dr. Douglass is not afraid to challenge the latest studies that come out, and share the real story with his readers. Dr. William C. Douglass has led a colorful, rebellious, and crusading life. ! <p>Not many physicians would dare put their professional reputations on the line as many times as this courageous healer has. A vocal opponent of "business-as-usual" medicine, Dr. Douglass has championed patients' rights and physician commitment to wellness throughout his career. Dr. Douglass comes from a distinguished family of physicians. He is the fourth generation Douglass to practice medicine, and his son is also a physician. Dr. Douglass graduated from the University of Rochester, the Miami School of Medicine, and the Naval School of Aviation and Space Medicine.</p></p><h2>Trotsky: A Biography</h2><p>Revolutionary practitioner, theorist, factional chief, sparkling writer, &#39;ladies&#39; man&#39; (e.g., his affair with Frieda Kahlo), icon of the Revolution, anti-Jewish Jew, philosopher of everyday life, grand seigneur of his household, father and hunted victim, Trotsky lived a brilliant life in extraordinary times. Robert Service draws on hitherto unexamined archives and on his profound understanding of Russian history to draw a portrait of the man and his legacy, revealing that though his followers have represented Trotsky as a pure revolutionary soul and a powerful intellect unjustly hounded into exile by Stalin and his henchmen. The reality is very different, as this masterful and compelling biography reveals.</p><p>Robert Service is a Fellow of the British Academy and of St Antony&#39;s College, Oxford. He has written several books, including the highly acclaimed Lenin: A Biography, Russia: Experiment with a People , Stalin: A Biography and Comrades: A History of World Communism, as well as many other books on Russia&#39;s past and present. Married with four children, he lives in London.''In this astonishingly comprehensive book--Robert Service has trawled almost every archive on the planet that has any reference to Trotsky--we get a clear picture of Trotsky's political development, his part in the 1917 revolution, his differences with Lenin, his break with Stalin and, finally, the years of exile and agitation in which he attracted a ragbag of bizarre followers and made the mistake of professing that there was a form of communism different to Stalin's...This is a superb work of scholarship, and above all leaves the reader in no doubt as to the evil of Trotsky, not just in politics but in his personal life...If you seek to know about this crucial figure in the history of Marxism-Leninism, this book will tell you everything.'' ----Simon Heffer, <i>Daily Telegraph</i><br><br>''Thick and intensely researched but a pleasure to read, it should remain the definitive work for some time...This is a thoughtful, rewarding and essential contribution to 20th-century history.'' --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>''Robert Service delivers an outstanding, fascinating biography of this dazzling titan. It is compelling as an adventure story--the ultimate rise and fall--but also revelatory as the scholarly revision of a historical reputation...The portrait of Trotsky's forgotten world of Jewish farmers and poverty-stricken Russian aristocrats is eccentric and intriguing. Trotsky himself hid much of his background that Service reveals for the first time...At the end of Service's revision, what remains of the Prophet? The intellectual, orator, manager of the Bolshevik coup and architect of the Civil War victory remain, but alongside them must be laid the mendacity of his memoirs, the ugly egotism and unpleasant, overweening arrogance, the belief in and enthusiastic practice of killing on a colossal scale, the political ineptitude, the limit of ambition. Apart from their famous row about "socialism in one country" versus international revolution, there was little politically between Stalin and Trotsky. It was personality that divided them and both personalities were highly unattractive. If Trotsky had become dictator, Service is clear that while Russia would have avoided Stalin's personal sadism, the same millions would still have been killed.'' ----Simon Sebag Montefiore, <i>Sunday Telegraph</i></p><h2>Sailing Alone Around the World</h2><p>Captain Joshua Slocum&#39;s solo voyage around the world in the 37-foot sloop the Spray in 1895 undoubtedly stands as one of the greatest sea adventures of all time.

TV tie-in. 300,000 first printing. $250,000 ad/promo.</p><p>All families have secrets. Some secrets are healthy. But others--those John Bradshaw called "dark secrets"--limit the wholeness and freedom of every member of the family, often generation after generation. John Bradshaw's compelling new book takes us into the hear of the family's mysterious power to impact our lives. It explores how secrets are created, how they influence us (even is we don't they are there), and the risks we take in exploring them. At the core of <i>Family Secrets</i> is a step-by-step guide to uncovering the secrets of the past and present, using a tool called the genogram to chart key relationships. Through many fascinating examples, it shows how to recognize crucial gaps and silences, reconstruct missing information, and decipher partial memories. It also offers readers advice on how to deal with the truths revealed, plus ways to stay safely and honestly connected with our families. <i>Family Secrets</i> is the basis of a multi-part PBS television series.Therapist and theologian John Bradshaw assures us that all families have secrets�from healthy secrets to repressed secrets that negatively affect generations. While codifying secrets, the charismatic lecturer introduces various tools used in family therapy. Bradshaw teaches the listener to make a genogram, a critical document in family-systems theory. He also explains the Johari window of self-knowledge. In one of the discussions, Bradshaw tells how a fellow therapist once characterized Bradshaw&#39;s voice as frantic. The description fits the author&#39;s reading of this book. The program requires concentration, light meditation and self-assessment quizzes. For this reason, it&#39;s not suitable for listening while exercising or driving. D.W.K.

When pushed for examples, many point to the early chapters of Genesis as proof-creation, the flood, 800-year life spans. And science has largely been silent on the subject-until now. </p><p>Examining recent, leading-edge scientific discoveries, Dr. Hugh Ross explores how these very chapters hold some of the strongest scientific evidence for the Bible's supernatural accuracy. Like never before, The Genesis Question integrates the accuracy of both science and the Bible-without compromise-giving skeptics and believers common ground and opportunity for dialog. </p><p>According to recent surveys conducted by Reasons to Believe, the perceived improbability of Genesis 1-11 is what keeps 90 percent of people from believing in the accuracy of the Bible. Complete and up-to-date, The Genesis Question uses scientific data to provide readers with solid answers to their questions regarding scientific advances and the accuracy of Genesis. </p><p>If you want to understand how the discoveries of science and the truth of the Bible relate, The Genesis Question offers a cutting-edge approach to integrate science and theology in such a way that neither is compromised. </p><p>"Dr. Ross intriguingly challenges the long-standing divide between faith and reason and between the Bible and science by addressing the relevant, cutting-edge questions of our day. Expect to find your mind challenged, your faith encouraged, and your ability to witness strengthened by this book."-Craig S. Keener, Th.D., visiting professor of Bible, Eastern Seminary and author of The IVP Bible Background Commentary </p><p>"The importance of The Genesis Question lies in its painstaking attempt to take the details of Genesis and science seriously. Even if the reader does not agree with every one of Ross' conclusions, one must thank him for this solid effort at integration, and for giving us a number of ideas that seem to me to be true, reasonable, and fruitful for spiritual nurture and evangelism."-J.P. Moreland, Ph.D., professor of philosophy, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University </p><p>"The Genesis Question is a substantial step in the direction of a fully satisfactory harmony of the science and theology of origins. We are not there yet-many questions remain open-but this book is a major step forward."-Samuel Connor, Ph.D. candidate in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology </p><p>"I've always had a gnawing suspicion that there was more that needed to be said to provide a clearer fit between God's written Word and the world He created. By beginning with the biblical premise that God's Word is without error, Dr. Ross has added authentic interpretations and fresh insights-coupled with the most up-to-date data on the physical realm-to reconcile God's written revelation to the revelation of Himself in His creation."-Mick Ukleja, Th.D., senior pastor, Grace Church </p><p>"In The Genesis Question, Dr. Hugh Ross gives general readers an excellent discussion of the biblical account and how a proper understanding of it is in agreement with modern scientific findings. He demonstrates an evangelical commitment to the truth of Scripture while also presenting the latest findings of science. I recommend this book to those whose understanding of science has stood in the way of Christian faith and to Christians who seek a scientifically solid and consistently biblical presentation of Genesis 1-11."-Kyle Cudworth, Ph.D., astronomer, Yerkes Observatory, University of Chicago </p><p>"Dr. Ross presents a fresh approach to many of Genesis' most difficult problems. He consistently takes into account the abundance of related scientific evidence without compromising the inerrancy of Scripture. I highly recommend this volume as an important and valuable tool in the library of anyone who really wants to understand what the beginning of Genesis is all about and still maintain a reasonable faith."-David H. Rogstad, Ph.D., Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory</p></p><p>DR. HUGH ROSS earned his B.S. in physics from the University of British Columbia and his M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Toronto. He is the founder and president of Reasons to Believe, and hosts a television series by the same name which is broadcast internationally on TBN. A highly requested speaker on the topics of faith and science, Dr. Ross has appeared on numerous radio and television programs, including &#34;CBS Television News,&#34; &#34;Praise the Lord,&#34; &#34;The 700 Club,&#34; and &#34;Focus on the Family.&#34; He is the author of three other NavPress books: The Creator And The Cosmos, Creation And Time, and Beyond The Cosmos. Dr. Ross and his family live in southern California.Ross, a "creationist," directs the efforts of Reasons to Believe, an institute dedicated to proclaiming and proving the factual character of events recorded in the Bible. In his latest work, he demonstrates that Genesis 1-11, a series of chapters that many biblical critics contend are stories that can't be verified historically or scientifically, contains some of the strongest evidence of the Bible's supernatural accuracy. He asserts that if the miracles of creation and the flood in Genesis can be validated, this will indicate the reality of scientifically non-testable miracles like the Virgin Birth and the resurrection of Lazarus. Ross argues that a literal reading of these early chapters in Genesis accords perfectly with the established scientific record. For example, he contends that God creates material and spiritual substance out of nothing. This nothingness, he notes, corresponds to the definition of physicists who claim that "nothing" is the lack of matter, energy and all 10 theoretical space-time dimensions of the universe, as proposed by mathematics. Thus, he says, God's creative activity can be substantiated by physical science. Ross has a faithful following who will welcome this book. Others may wonder why he is trying so hard to turn faith into science. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>George Shrinks (Reading Rainbow)</h2><p>Undaunted at finding that he&#x2019;s shrunk to the size of a mouse, George starts in on his household duties, from brushing his teeth to taking out the garbage and looking after his baby brother&#x2014;all Herculean tasks for this tiny guy in an oversized world. &#x2018;Paintings with realistic detail and perspective show a mouse-eye view of what high adventure boring chores become.

Volcker. During his tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, when he battled the Great Inflation of the 1970s, Volcker did nothing less than restore the reputation of an American financial system on the verge of collapse. After the 2008 financial meltdown, the nation turned again to Volcker to restore trust in a shaky financial system: President Obama would name his centerpiece Wall Street regulation the Volcker Rule. Volcker's career demonstrated that a determined central banker can prevail over economic turmoil-so long as he can resist relentless political pressure. His resolve and independent thinking-sorely tested by Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan-laid the foundation for a generation of economic stability. Indeed, William L. Silber argues, it was only Volcker's toughness on monetary policy that "forced Reagan to be Reagan" and to rein in America's deficit.</p><p>Noted scholar and finance expert Silber draws on hours of candid personal interviews and complete access to Volcker's personal papers to render dramatic behind-the-scenes accounts from Volcker's career at the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve: secret negotiations with European ministers; confrontations with the White House; crisis conferences with Wall Street titans, and even tense boardroom rebellions within the Fed itself. Filled with frank commentary from Volcker himself-including why he was personally irked with the "Volcker Rule" label-this will be the definitive account of Volcker's indispensable role in American economic history.</p></p><p>William L. Silber is one of America's most respected experts on finance and banking. He is currently Marcus Nadler Professor of Finance and Economics and Director of the Glucksman Institute for Research in Securities Markets at the Stern School of Business, NYU. His many books include<i> When Washington Shut Down Wall Street: The Great Financial Crisis of 1914 </i>and <i>the Origins of America's Monetary Supremacy.</i> He is co-author of the standard textbook <i>Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i> and, with Lawrence Ritter, of the classic <i>Money</i>.<p>&#x201c;...Comes at the perfect time...Mr. Silber offers fascinating subplots and revelations along the way--not to mention a portrait of a tough and colorful man--but his main storyline concerns two of the most dramatic policy changes in economic history, one international, the other domestic. Mr. Volcker played a key role in both.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John B. Taylor, The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;This detailed account of the economist Paul Volcker's public service in five administartions shows how he maintained his integrity.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Times (named an Editors Choice)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Mr Volcker barely made it through his eight years at the Fed. He nearly failed to be reappointed in 1983 and almost resigned in 1986, when defeated on a key vote. It was only in retrospect that his reputation grew; Mr Silber's well-written book should help cement it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;William L. Silber has written a rich and detailed new biography of a man who has left as deep an imprint on the world economy as anyone of his generation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Neil Irwin, Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;William Silber, a financial historian and professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, has the challenge of fitting this lopsided story--his subject, who turned 85 last month, enjoyed his most fruitful years before age 60--into a coherent narrative. He succeeds admirably in Volcker: The Triumph of Persistence. Silber, who had Volcker's cooperation, emphasizes the former Fed chief's independence and willingness to take unpopular stances, a trait as laudable in public life as it is uncommon.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Roger Lowenstein, Bloomberg BusinessWeek</i></p><p>&#x201c;What [Silber] does bring is a sophisticated and nuanced understanding of monetary policy and international finance, along with that rare ability among academics to explain it while weaving an interesting tale.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;Paul A. Volcker has finally been awarded a meticulous historical account of exactly how he reached his exalted position ... this book is a treasure trove for policy wonks...&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Paul Volcker was chairman of the Fed from 1979 to 1987. His foe was inflation--the opposite of the high unemployment fought by Ben Bernanke today. But the pressues on the two men from purists academics and interfering politicians are eerily similar. That makes this fine new biography especially timely.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robin Harding, Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;I have just finished reading the book <i>Volcker: The Triumph of Persistence </i>by William L. Silber. It is an excellent book, well written, and a book that I could not put down.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Mason, Seeking Alpha</i></p><p>&#x201c;William Silber weaves a subtle link between the three crises that tested Paul Volcker: gold in 1971, inflation in 1979, and sub-prime mortgages in 2007. He tells the story of Volcker's success in a lively and authoritative style, but unless America heeds the lessons for fiscal responsibility that Silber draws from Volcker's record, the crisis that lies ahead could make those past upheavals seem tame by comparison. Every member of Congress and concerned citizen should read this book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nouriel Roubini, Chairman, Roubini Global Economics and author of Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance</i></p><p>&#x201c;By observing the life of Paul Volcker, an extraordinary public servant, William Silber has created an absorbing story about how theories and personalities affect public policies and economic outcomes. This book presents a novel explanation for how Volcker defeated inflation, and at the same time, delivers an important message for the complex economic problems we face today.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thomas Sargent, 2011 Nobel Laureate in Economics</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book shows how much the character and purpose of a single man can play a fundamental role in economic history. The end of the gold-dollar standard in 1971 and the end of out-of-control inflation after 1979 are the dominant economic events of the last half century. But standard economic models do not tell us why these things happened. William Silber shows strikingly how much the leadership of Paul Volcker lay behind these events.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert J. Shiller, Yale University, author of Irrational Exuberance</i></p><p>&#x201c;Paul Volcker's contributions to the health of our economy and society are truly legendary, so all of us can learn from this careful account of his thinking and his courageous actions.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>George P. Shultz, former Secretary of Labor, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of State</i></p><p>&#x201c;Paul Volcker championed mystique as the essence of central banking--but always resting on the twin foundations of principle and analysis. Using previously unpublished papers and private conversations, William Silber delves behind the mystique to reveal the principles and analysis that guided this towering figure of international finance over the past 40 years.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Volcker: The Triumph of Persistence</i> gives an insightful account of the true depth and breadth of America's financial crisis and its heavy political pressures as the country faced potential economic collapse. Volcker is one of the wise men of this period.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Henry A. Kissinger</i></p><p>&#x201c;What makes this book great and not just good is the confidence and authority with which Silber presents his case. Volcker has found his muse. The sheer courage it took Volcker to battle inflation gives today's central bankers something to live up to.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Amity Shlaes, author of The Forgotten Man</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is a well-written and comprehensive book that reveals the many attributes of Paul Volcker. Silber shows that Volcker did not become an instant folk hero. Rather he fought valiantly and successfully to overcome opposition from powerful politicians and institutions while breaking the back of inflation. After reading this book people will understand how Volcker balanced public and private responsibilities while becoming an American financial icon.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Henry Kaufman</i></p><p>&#x201c;Silber provides an overview of American economic history as well as insights into surviving financial crises and the complexities of economic decision making. Its in-depth treatment of its subject and the primary documents and notes it includes would be challenging to find by other means. Recommended&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;From a fellow economist, an admiring biography of Paul A. Volcker...blessedly free of jargon.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Historians will find rich material and insight in this telling book&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;William L. Silber's new biography is therefore to be welcomed, and Volcker: The Triumph of Persistence will likely be regarded as the authoritative treatment of its subject.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Boston Review</i></p></p><h2>Flat Stanley</h2><p>Children&#39;s Book</p><p></p><h2>The Search for Joyful (The Story of Mrs. Mike Continues)</h2><p>As World War II closes in, Kathy Forquet leaves behind the warmth and security of her home with the Flannigans to enroll in nursing school, where her life unfolds with excitement and a new understanding of her Native American heritage.</p><p>Benedict Freedman lives outside San Francisco, and isat work on more sequels that take the characters of <b>Mrs. Mike</b> into the present. <br>Nancy Freedman lives outside San Francisco, and is at work on more sequels that take the characters of <b>Mrs. Mike</b> into the present.Apparently some sequels take longer to appear than others: more than 50 years after the publication of the popular Mrs. Mike, which told of Mary O'Fallon's journey from Boston to Alberta and her marriage to RCMP Sgt. Mike Flanagan, the story continues during WWII with one of Mary's adopted children, Kathy Forquet. Mike has been dead for six years and Kathy, whose background is Cree, decides to learn more about the heritage of her late mother, Oh-Be-Joyful. She is also determined to find out the difference between joy and mere happiness, so she leaves her small Canadian town to train as a nurse in Montreal, which Mary refers to as "sin city." There, Kathy begins to stand up for herself and explores romance with two men, one of whom shares her heritage, the other an Austrian soldier whose wounds she tends. The Mrs. Mike who presumably made the original so charming to generations of readers is hardly present here, merely framing Kathy's tale. As for Kathy, her voice never gains any real sophistication and when she does things like chauffeur a general to Naples because she's an "ace" driver, her Zelig-like position at the center of events lacks verisimilitude. Meanwhile, other characters talk as though they're reading from history texts rather than being participants in the world at war around them. Some downright weird sentences ("There's a big wad of undigested feeling stuck in me") should have been edited out, and in the end, Kathy, a small-scale heroine who is more acted upon than acting, isn't allowed to find joy; it is visited upon her. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Westing Game: A Puzzle Mystery (An Avon Flare Book)</h2><p>Each of the sixteen people invited to the reading of a very strange will are given $10,000, a set of clues, and the chance to become a millionaire</p><p>Ellen Raskin was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and grew up during the Great Depression.

And until 1969, I didn&#x2019;t really know her, although when I was the children&#x2019;s-book editor at Holt, Rinehart and Winston, she had illustrated <i>Books: A Book to Begin On,</i> by Susan Bartlett, and <i>Come Along!</i>, by Rebecca Caudill&#x2014;as well as doing for us some of the one thousand book jackets of which she was so proud.</p><p>Our friendship really began in the smoking car (like the title character of <i>Moe Q. McGlutch</i>, Ellen smoked too much) of a Pennsylvania Railroad train en route from New York to Philadelphia, where we were both speaking on a panel. I stopped to say hello, and she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sitting here alone because I&#x2019;m so nervous. I hate speaking.&#x201d; &#x201c;I hate it, too,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;ve given up smoking.&#x201d; In the depressed gloom that followed this exchange, the beginning of a bond was formed.</p><p>That same year I moved from Holt to E. P. Dutton. Their office was located at Union Square and Seventeenth Street, only a short walk from Ellen&#x2019;s apartment on Eighth Street, and we got together more often. One day, Ellen confided that she had always wanted to adapt <i>Goblin Market,</i> by Christina Rossetti, as a picture-book text. I thought of the lavishly rich visual details of the poem, and I longed to see how she would illustrate it. &#x201d;Would you do the book for me?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Jean [Jean Karl, her editor at Atheneum] doesn&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d; Ellen was always candid. So she did do it&#x2014;her first book for Dutton. One of her exquisitely intricate paintings for that book now hangs on my wall.</p><p>We often talked about our lives, and I particularly loved stories about her family and how she and her parents and sister drove around the country during the Great Depression so her father could look for work, an epic safari that took them from Milwaukee to California. &#x201c;You should write a book about growing up in the Depression,&#x201d; I told her.</p></p><h2>Buddenbrooks: The Decline of a Family (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics)</h2><p>Millennium Project edition with library markings, shelf wear to dust jacket, page edges tanned. Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>"A remarkable achievement.... In Mr. Woods's sparkling new translation, the reader now encounters a work that is closer in style, vocabulary, idiom and tone to the original." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p> First published in 1900, when Thomas Mann was twenty-five, <i>Buddenbrooks</i> is a minutely imagined chronicle of four generations of a North German mercantile family--a work so true to life that it scandalized the author's former neighbors in his native L�beck. As he charts the Buddenbrooks' decline from prosperity to bankruptcy, from moral and psychic soundness to sickly piety, artistic decadence, and madness, Mann ushers the reader into a world of rich vitality, pieced together from births and funerals, weddings and divorces, recipes, gossip, and earthy humor.</p><p> Now Mann's triumph of realism is available in its first new English version in seventy years. With perfect fidelity, John E. Woods gives us a <i>Buddenbrooks</i> that is rich in dialect and varied in tone, exuberant in its wordplay and unfettered in its comedy. He has restored a classic to its origins and put blood back in its veins.</p><p> "A cause for rejoicing." --<i>Library Journal</i></p><p> "Wonderfully fresh and elegant ... bound to become the definitive English version ... essential reading for anybody who wishes to enter Mann's fictional universe." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p>A Major Literary Event: a brilliant new translation of Thomas Mann's first great novel, one of the two for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1929.<br><br>Buddenbrooks, first published in Germany in 1900, when Mann was only twenty-five, has become a classic of modem literature -- the story of four generations of a wealthy bourgeois family in northern Germany. With consummate skill, Mann draws a rounded picture of middle-class life: births and christenings; marriages, divorces, and deaths; successes and failures. These commonplace occurrences, intrinsically the same, vary slightly as they recur in each succeeding generation. Yet as the Buddenbrooks family eventually succumbs to the seductions of modernity -- seductions that are at variance with its own traditions -- its downfall becomes certain.<br><br>In immensity of scope, richness of detail, and fullness of humanity, Buddenbrooks surpasses all other modem family chronicles; it has, indeed, proved a model for most of them. Judged as the greatest of Mann's novels by some critics, it is ranked as among the greatest by all. Thomas Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1929.</p><h2>The Wind in the Willows (Illustrated Junior Library)</h2><p>The escapades of four animal friends who live along a river in the English countryside--Toad, Mole, Rat, and Badger.</p><p>"[Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud. Grahame's <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> has enchanted readers for four generations, and this lavishly illustrated gift edition is perhaps the finest around. <i>(All ages, or 9 to 12)</i> <p>This reviews refers to ISBN 0805002138.</p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Mars, Book 8</h2><p>A bad boy can change a good girl forever.

From these journeys we discover how much the Desert People know about the dynamics of their arid homeland in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. The<i> Desert Smells Like Rain </i>offers insights into the natural history of desert plants and animals as it documents a dying agricultural tradition that has enriched the biological diversity of the Papago's seemingly harsh environment. Drawing on his extensive scientific research and study of Papago folklore, as well as his years of work among the Desert People in village gardening and nutrition programs, Nabhan portrays a desert-adapted way of life that has persisted despite the pressures of modern civilization.<br><br></p><p><br>Gary Paul Nabhan is an ethnobiologist and natural history writer working in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona.

He and his family currently reside in Tempe, Arizona, near the Desert Botanical Garden, where he serves as Assistant Director.<br><br><br>"Gary Nabhan's compassionate observation of Papago land ethics is important work, capable of broad application. He is a naturalist in the full sense of the word, because he has not forgotten the people."--Barry Lopez<br><br>"He manages, in a series of spare and sometimes tantalizing selections, to convey a real sense of people and their environment."--<i>The Village Voice</i><br><br>"His eyes are those of a scientist, his prose and vision a poet's: spare, evocative, respectful of both facts and mysteries."--<i>Orion Nature Quarterly</i><br><br>"His sensitive and compassionate portrayal of the Papagos is a real contribution."--Rep.

He&#x2019;s also a member of Aquarius 3 with Shoji Tajima and Takeshi Obata. Tegami Bachi/Letter Bee is his most recent series.Gauche is a young mailman, a letter bee; accompanied by his dingo Roda, he make deliveries through a land of darkness with little travel between outposts. His first package is, unexpectedly, a young orphan boy who must be taken on a 10-day journey across wasteland inhabited by metallic insects. Together, they learn more about each other's motivation: Gauche works far from his sick sister to make money to heal her, while the boy, Lag, is trying to find out what happened to his mother. Gauche takes his missions seriously, knowing that his letters (whatever their form) are connections between people. They carry heart, the key motivator of the series. In the second story, five years later, Lag is following in Gauche's footsteps with a delivery that echoes his past, a girl with mysterious abilities. This adventure includes both exciting action and touching emotion. The simple premise is easy to grasp, but has potential for almost any kind of story as the series continues. The art has a detailed sense of world-building with distinctive character appearances. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is a historian, educator, motivational speaker, Lakota craftsman and has worked as both technical adviser and actor in television movies, including Return to Lonesome Dove. A recipient of the Wyoming Humanities Award, he is author of four collections of essays and short stories.Hearing the Lakota historian and storyteller read these wonderful tales, listeners will know they are part of a deep historical tradition of teaching character traits through colorful, heartwarming stories. Marshall is a quiet and intimate interpreter who stands back from the stories and lets their curious power speak for itself. The narrative presents the lessons as passed down to a grieving young man by his grandfather. The dialogue between the two provides a timeless view of what young people in every culture need and mostly do not ask their elders to provide. The lessons on determination, perseverance, courage, and faith are made more poignant by the sting of the young man's immediate loss and the grind of life's constant challenges.

Tour.</p><p><i>Sudden Mischief</i>, the 25th Spenser novel, finds Robert B. Parker's seemingly ageless sleuth once again engaging Boston's bad guys and sorting out life's moral dilemmas, all (or mostly) in the name of love. When Spenser's girlfriend, psychiatrist Susan Silverman, asks him to investigate charges of sexual harassment leveled against her ex-husband, Brad Sterling, the detective agrees, though the assignment "shows every sign of not working out well." As the sexual harassment allegations melt like April snow, Sterling drops out of sight, a dead body appears in his office, and Spenser discovers a murky slush of clues that suggest Sterling's work as a marketing genius for local charities has been a front for some truly despicable criminal activities. As always, the more-than-slightly-shady Hawk is on hand to help Spenser sort the good from the bad, but Spenser is left to his own devices when it comes to making sense of the emotional havoc the case creates in his relationship with Susan. And what devices they are: emotionally mature and physically dynamic, Spenser once again proves himself as detective, friend, lover, and human being as Sterling's reappearance forces Susan to examine her past and her conscience while searching for her own autonomy. As always, Spenser endures as an intelligent, ethical, and poetic private eye, even if his endless middle age seems a bit supernatural. Parker's nimble, Spartan prose suits a character who carries his years in wisdom rather than body fat. If the heart of any truly great detective series is a truly great detective, <i>Sudden Mischief</i> and the rest of Parker's Spenser novels surely fit the bill. <i>--L.A. Smith</i>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.</p><h2>The Diary of a Young Girl</h2><p>The book has been used. The pages are somewhat yellowish. But the binding is solid and the book is perfectly readable. No annotations, no marks inside the pages.</p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank&#39;s diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit&#39;s indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now.

Drawing on 14 years of clinical experience and research, Dr. Gabriel Cousens discusses nutritional issues that can help answer these questions, including raw vs. cooked food; high vs. low protein; the concepts of assimilation and fasting; alkaline--acid balance; attitudes about food; nutrients, energy, and structure building.<br><br>In addition, Cousens shares his new dietary system of "spiritual nutrition" that is based on the relationship that the color of the food has to corresponding colors of the human chakra system, hence, the "rainbow diet." For true nourishment, he strongly promotes the connection of diet to meditation, fellowship, wisdom, and love.</p><p>Dr. Gabriel Cousens, M.D. is an internationally celebrated spiritual teacher, author, lecturer, world peace-worker, and physician of the soul.

For the period, it was the most complicated watch ever created.

On December 2, 1999, Philippe Stern, president of the venerable Swiss watchmaker Patek Philippe, found himself once again in her grasp. Keeping his steely Genevese reserve, he glanced at his watch, an impeccably crafted Patek Philippe, purportedly the perpetual calendar made in 1943, the one given to him by his father, Henri, who had preceded him as president. At sixty-one, Stern remained the very picture of understated elegance. A gentle man with thinning white hair, he had quietly slipped away from his office at the company&#x2019;s headquarters in Plan-les-Ouates, a sleepy village on the outskirts of Geneva, well before the appointed hour for the auction of the legendary Supercomplication, the most exquisitely complex mechanical watch ever created. Given the time, it was probably best to take the telephone call from his family&#x2019;s villa in Ani�res on the shores of Lake Geneva. In any event he would be more comfortable there.<br> <br>The time quickly approached 8:30 p.m., nearly 2:30 p.m. in New York City. There was still some time before the auction began. It had been thirty years since the Supercomplication had last surfaced. Having already eluded the family once, the moments until bidding opened were relatively short.<br> <br>Outside, the wind scythed across the lake in the spectral dark of winter. Here on Lac L�man, Stern had won a record seven regattas as a young sailor. A fierce competitor, he had also been a member of the Swiss national ski team. Along with his wife, Gerdi, herself a European mushing champion, Stern had competed in international dog sled races. The roster of pastimes enjoyed by the head of one of the oldest Swiss watchmakers, as it had been noted, all revolved around beating the clock. Stern had once described his hobbies as good business training, saying that they had taught him &#x201c;to go fast and take risks sometimes.&#x201d;<br> <br>With the anticipation of victory, Stern put the telephone to his ear. Four thousand miles away, his aide-de-camp Alan Banbery was waiting for him.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Everyone who was anyone in the insular world of watch collecting filed into Sotheby&#x2019;s ten-story glass-and-steel tower at 1334 York Avenue on Manhattan&#x2019;s Upper East Side on that unseasonably warm afternoon. Just three weeks before Christmas, thermometers registered 60 degrees. At the Botanical Gardens, fragrant white blooms had broken out five months prematurely, and a ring of yellow forsythia blossoms graced the city with a touch of spring. As the mercury soared, so did the stock market. The Dow pushed past 11,000, marking the end of the millennium with record gains. The entire city appeared to levitate on its great good fortune. Watching the buoyant crowd descend upon Sotheby&#x2019;s, a betting man could wager with ease that, before the day was over, more than one record would be broken.<br> <br>As in previous years, the major auction houses dangled before an excitable audience the spectacle of record-smashing greatness for paintings, jewels, and objets d&#x2019;art, all with impeccable provenance or rarity. Each season brought an increasing fervor. A daisy chain of superlatives wrapped around each sale. The items featured were not just rare but extremely rare. They were not merely important but the most important. More than offering desirables of a certain vintage, the auction houses were peddling history bound in shiny catalogues and generated in regularly scheduled cycles. And the press and public responded like hounds to blood.<br> <br>For weeks, expectations followed the Dow over Sotheby&#x2019;s &#x201c;Masterpieces of the Time Museum.&#x201d; Eighty-one watches and clocks were set to go on the block. Culled from the 3,500-piece collection of Seth G. Atwood, a wealthy entrepreneur and something of an eccentric, these were some of the most extraordinary and important timepieces created since man began calculating the minutes and hours and fashioning devices by which to measure them. A quick rifle through the handsomely appointed catalogue yielded numerous affirmations that the auction&#x2019;s billing offered more than hyperbole. &#x201c;Sometimes sales catalogues are mutton dressed as lamb,&#x201d; one Sotheby&#x2019;s veteran dryly noted at the sale. &#x201c;This was not the case.&#x201d;<br> <br>By any measure the sale was unprecedented. Fascinated with the art and the science of time, Atwood had become one of the world&#x2019;s most significant collectors and horological scholars. He hailed from an old-line Illinois family that made its fortune in manufacturing, banking, and real estate, which afforded him the leisure to pursue his interests wherever they took him. He had spent the past three decades circling the globe, cherry-picking the most important clocks and watches in history, mounting a private collection that came to rival that of the British Museum&#x2014;in importance if not scope. To house his collection, Atwood had constructed the Time Museum, located in his hometown, far from all known capitals (horological or otherwise), in the basement of his Clock Tower Inn in Rockford, Illinois, a green little pocket of nowhere straddling the Rock River, off Interstate 90.<br> <br>While universally acknowledged as an endearingly kind and charming fellow, Atwood had rightfully earned a reputation as a bull in the world&#x2019;s china shop of clocks. Rivals collapsed when he was in the game. And once a timepiece was in Atwood&#x2019;s possession the game was over. Knowledgeable horophiles accepted that it was as likely that the sun would change course and rise in the West as that Atwood&#x2019;s collection could ever be broken up and sold in lots. Yet at age eighty-two, Atwood had resolved to do just that. He was shutting down his museum (a process that would be filled with a number of unforeseen twists and turns and take several years) and, somewhat unsentimentally, deaccessioning its priceless contents.<br> <br>Few could recall an auction of this caliber and range. Atwood&#x2019;s assemblage represented an astonishing array of ancient astrolabes, astronomical chiming clocks, musical automata, and other devices of wonder from every period, important watchmaker, and country from the beginning of timekeeping. &#x201c;It was mind-blowing,&#x201d; described one British dealer who arrived with instructions to bid on a number of the lots on behalf of his deep-pocketed clients. &#x201c;Just looking at it set the heart aflutter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lot 22 contained the famous Ormolu-mounted red boulle Sympathique no. 128, made in 1835 by the House of Breguet for the Duc d&#x2019;Orl�ans. Watchmaker to Louis XVI, Napoleon, Marie Antoinette, and the sultans of the Ottoman Empire, the Swiss-born Parisian Abraham-Louis Breguet remains the greatest watchmaker in history. It was Breguet who invented the tourbillon, circa 1795, an ingeniously delicate and tiny gyroscope-like device that turns about every minute to compensate for gravity&#x2019;s pull on a movement, dramatically improving accuracy and revolutionizing timekeeping. The wittily inventive Sympathique was designed with a removable pocket watch that rested in a cradle atop the main clock. A series of pins locked the pocket watch into position, while overnight a mechanism inside the clock movement rewound, readjusted, and reset its companion with jumping hours, a quarter repeater that chimed precisely on the quarter hour, and a power reserve indicator. The clock was one of only eleven ever produced.<br> <br>Even in the seventeenth century, when the manufacture of any timepiece was far from routine, the final lot, the Tompion no. 381, was quite something. A gilt-brass, mounted red tortoiseshell table clock featuring both grande sonnerie and quarter repeating chimes, it was one of only three such pieces manufactured by the brilliant seventeenth-century British clockmaker Thomas Tompion. The Englishman first earned a name in 1676 when King Charles II commissioned him to create two faultlessly accurate clocks for the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, which notably became the center of world time in 1884. By the time of Tompion&#x2019;s death in 1713, the eminent clockmaker had become a national treasure and was buried with royalty in the nave of Westminster Abbey.<br> <br>In an auction with many rare and ingenious instruments, the sale&#x2019;s crown jewel belonged to Lot 7. Known as the Graves Supercomplication, the double-dial pocket watch was a miniature masterpiece of mechanical engineering. First commissioned in 1925 by the enigmatic New York financier Henry Graves, Jr., from Patek Philippe &amp; Co., the pocket watch, measuring three and a half inches wide and scarcely one inch deep, was the storied Geneva watchmaker&#x2019;s magnum opus, requiring three years to contemplate its design and nearly another five to produce.<br> <br>Elaborately constructed in eighteen-carat gold and jeweled pivots, the Supercomplication boasted the skill and expense expended by Patek Philippe. The watch&#x2019;s enamel dials were protected by crystal with the hardness of sapphire, penetrable only by a diamond. Crafted at a time when watchmakers hand-tooled their own parts, the Supercomplication consisted of over 900 individual pieces&#x2014;most no bigger than a grain of rice or thicker than a strand of hair. An orchestra of 430 screws, 110 wheels, more than 120 various movable parts, and 70 jewels produced a symphony of 24 complications. This dazzling array included a different chronological function for each hour of the day, a perpetual calendar (requiring resetting only in the year 2100), and a split-second chronograph. Smaller sub-dials indicated the exact time of sunrise and sunset calibrated for New York City, while another measured the phases of the moon. A minute repeater struck the hour, half-hour, and quarter-hour, playing the same tintinnabulary melody as heard ringing out from Big Ben, the great bell clock rising over London&#x2019;s Palace of Westminster. These were but a fraction of the watch&#x2019;s virtues. A midnight-blue celestial chart also mapped the nighttime sky over Manhattan, complete with the exact magnitudes of the stars and the Milky Way gliding across the sky in tandem with the actual heavens.<br> <br>For this horological Willy Wonka factory in miniature, Graves paid 60,000 Swiss francs, the equivalent of $15,000 at the time, a staggering amount. Measured in 1999 dollars, the price equaled some $265,000, but in effect such an undertaking would cost closer to $2 million.<br> <br>The Supercomplication was more than just a golden toy for the Gilded Age. In the history of timekeeping, less than a handful of grandes complications&#x2014;including Breguet&#x2019;s fabled Marie-Antoinette, the crystal pocket watch made for the ill-fated French queen&#x2014;have reached the highest levels of haute horlogerie, earning the title of a &#x201c;supercomplication.&#x201d; Possessing twenty-four complications, the Graves eclipsed them all. Even with the march of years and the advent of modern technology, the watch is a technological achievement of the highest order. Entirely calculated and crafted by hand, the Supercomplication was a powerful computer of time before there were computers.<br> <br>Produced on a dare, Patek Philippe&#x2019;s tour de force inspired marvel and desire. It was as if Merlin captured Galileo, Shakespeare, Newton, and Beethoven, encased their essence in gold, and then slipped the mechanism inside a man&#x2019;s waistcoat, where their collective genius might tick through eternity.<br> <br>In the annals of timekeeping the Supercomplication loomed large in any important collector&#x2019;s understanding of the field. Its technical triumph, however, was only part of its luster. The pocket watch had been the victor in a strange contest that took place long ago between Graves, a fiercely private society tycoon, and his rival, James Ward Packard, the automobile magnate, during the early years of the twentieth century, when enterprising Americans amassed huge fortunes in banking, auto making, coal, oil, steel, and the railways. Their newly minted prosperity soon eclipsed the lucre accumulated over a millennium by European royalty. Keen to demonstrate the cultured face of capitalism&#x2019;s excess, America&#x2019;s moneyed moguls scooped up European patrimonies, paying enormous sums for Old Master paintings and sculptures, antique tapestries, ancient manuscripts, and ingenious mechanical pocket watches.<br> <br>Throughout history, these beautiful instruments represented the most innovative, extravagant gadgets that money could buy, available to an elite few. King Farouk I of Egypt, intrigued by their beauty and exotic novelty, possessed a collection of erotic automata pieces. On one of his most famous, the king calculated the time by counting the number of sexual thrusts executed by the figures inside the watch&#x2019;s movement, visible with the press of a button on the lid. In the early seventeenth century, Swiss, French, and English watchmakers flocked to Constantinople, vying for the patronage of the sultans who acquired thousands of highly ornate timepieces as astrological amusements.<br> <br>Once the prerogative of the aristocracy, watches had become the ultimate status symbol of wealth, and America&#x2019;s financial princes found themselves not merely bewitched by their beauty but transfixed by their illustrious pedigrees. The country&#x2019;s most powerful banker, the cigar-chomping John Pierpont Morgan, spent enormous sums to purchase 240 European timepieces dating to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In love with his own legacy, Morgan eventually bequeathed his collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br> <br>Henry Graves, Jr., a private man of fine tastes and even grander possessions, and James Ward Packard, the brilliant engineer, both possessed the passion and limitless purse to acquire the finest instruments ever produced. Timepieces from antiquity scarcely roused their attention, but over the course of three decades the pair engaged in a surreptitious collecting duel to own the most complicated watch of their era. Their patronage spurred Swiss watchmakers, chief among them Patek Philippe, to craft ever more innovative and ingenious timepieces, pushing the boundaries of mathematics, astronomy, craftsmanship, technology, and physics. Their contest produced a series of transcendently unique grandes complications. Almost a century later, very few of their timepieces had ever come to market. The rather gauzy tale of how &#x201c;the Graves&#x201d; ended up in the hands of Seth Atwood added another layer to the watch&#x2019;s already considerable mystique.<br> <br>Among horophiles, the Supercomplication was considered the Mona Lisa of timepieces, and most believed they were likely to see Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s masterpiece appear on the market before the Graves ever went under the hammer. Should the legendary piece leave the Graves family and come onto the open market, it was widely accepted that it would land in Patek Philippe&#x2019;s private collection. Yet in a stunning reversal, Seth Atwood acquired the Supercomplication on March 26, 1969. Thirty years later, even the Stern family had to admit that the pocket watch&#x2019;s path from Henry Graves, Jr.&#x2019;s Fifth Avenue vault to Sotheby&#x2019;s wood-paneled seventh-floor salesroom was as unexpected and random as the watch was obsessively crafted and meticulously built.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Surveying the room, Daryn Schnipper, Sotheby&#x2019;s director of worldwide watches and clocks, found it difficult to contain her composure. Securing the Time Museum sale and with it the Graves had been a coup for the auction house. For nearly twenty years, the petite, bright-eyed brunette had traveled between Europe and New York and, more recently, Asia, building up Sotheby&#x2019;s slice of the growing global watch market. When she first joined the auction house in 1980, t...</p><h2>The Bible Exposition Commentary: Old Testament (The Pentateuch)</h2><p>By Dr. Warren Wiersbe<br> Compiled from Dr. Wiersbe's best-selling"BE" series with over 3 million copies in print! <p></p> Here at last is the exciting truth of the Old Testament Scriptures wrapped in the warm, personal style of one of America's best-loved Bible teachers, Warren Wiersbe. <p></p> Dr. Wiersbe brings the people, places, history, and teachings of the Pentateuch to life in the pages of <b><i>The Bible Exposition Commentary</i></b><i>.</i> This volume is compiled from the following"BE" series books:<p></p> <p></p> <b> Be Basic</b> Genesis 1&#x2013;11 <br> <b>Be Obedient</b> Genesis 12&#x2013;25<br> <b>Be Authentic</b> Genesis 25&#x2013;50<br> <b>Be Delivered</b> Exodus<br> <b>Be Holy</b> Leviticus<br> <b>Be Counted</b> Numbers<br> <b>Be Equipped</b> Deuteronomy <p></p> There will be three subsequent volumes covering the Major and Minor Prophets, the Historical Books, and <br> the Wisdom Books and Poetry.<p></p> Study the Pentateuch in digestible sections that emphasize personal application as well as biblical content.

What&#x2026;&#x201d; He sat up, rubbing at his eyes with one hand. &#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Get up!&#x201d; Setheris snarled. &#x201c;Hurry!&#x201d; <br>Obediently, Maia crawled out of bed, clumsy and sleep-sodden. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s toward? Is there a fire?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Get thy clothes on.&#x201d; Setheris shoved yesterday&#x2019;s clothes at him. Maia dropped them, fumbling with the strings of his nightshirt, and Setheris hissed with exasperation as he bent to pick them up. &#x201c;A messenger from the court. <i>That&#x2019;s</i> what&#x2019;s toward.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A message from my father?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is&#x2019;t not what I said? Merciful goddesses, boy, canst do <i>nothing</i> for thyself? Here!&#x201d; He jerked the nightshirt off, caring neither for the knotted strings nor for Maia&#x2019;s ears, and shoved his clothes at him again. Maia struggled into drawers, trousers, shirt, and jacket, aware that they were wrinkled and sweat-stained, but unwilling to try Setheris&#x2019;s ill temper by saying so. Setheris watched grimly by the single candle&#x2019;s light, his ears flat against his head. Maia could not find his stockings, nor would Setheris give him time to search. &#x201c;Come along!&#x201d; he said as soon as Maia had his jacket fastened, and Maia followed him barefoot out of the room, noticing in the stronger light that while Setheris was still properly and fully attired, his face was flushed. So he had not been wakened from sleep by the emperor&#x2019;s messenger, but only because he had not yet been to bed. Maia hoped uneasily that Setheris had not drunk enough metheglin to mar the glossy perfection of his formal court manners. <br>Maia ran his hands through his hair, fingers catching on knots in his heavy curls. It would not be the first time one of his father&#x2019;s messengers had witnessed him as unkempt as a half-witted ragpicker&#x2019;s child, but that did not help with the miserable midnight imaginings: <i>So, tell us, how looked our son?</i> He reminded himself it was unlikely his father ever asked after him in the first place and tried to keep his chin and ears up as he followed Setheris into the lodge&#x2019;s small and shabby receiving room. <br>The messenger was maybe a year or so older than Maia himself, but elegant even in his road-stained leathers. He was clearly full-blooded elvish, as Maia was not; his hair was milkweed-pale, and his eyes the color of rain. He looked from Setheris to Maia and said, &#x201c;Are you the Archduke Maia Drazhar, only child of Varenechibel the Fourth and Chenelo Drazharan?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Maia said, bewildered. <br>And then bewilderment compounded bewilderment, as the messenger deliberately and with perfect dignity prostrated himself on the threadbare rug. &#x201c;Your Imperial Serenity,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Oh, get up, man, and stop babbling!&#x201d; Setheris said. &#x201c;We understood that you had messages from the Archduke&#x2019;s father.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then you understand what we do not,&#x201d; the messenger said, rising again to his feet, as graceful as a cat. &#x201c;We bear messages from the Untheileneise Court.&#x201d; <br>Maia said hastily, merely to prevent the altercation from escalating, &#x201c;Please, explain.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your Serenity,&#x201d; the messenger said. &#x201c;The airship <i>Wisdom of Choharo</i> crashed yesterday, sometime between sunrise and noon. The Emperor Varenechibel the Fourth, the Prince Nemolis, the Archduke Nazhira, and the Archduke Ciris were all on board. They were returning from the wedding of the Prince of Thu-Athamar.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And the <i>Wisdom of Choharo</i> crashed,&#x201d; Maia said slowly, carefully. <br>&#x201c;Yes, Serenity,&#x201d; said the messenger. &#x201c;There were no survivors.&#x201d; <br>For five pounding heartbeats, the words made no sense. Nothing made sense; nothing had made sense since he had woken with Setheris&#x2019;s grip hurting his shoulder. And then it was suddenly, pitilessly clear. As if from a very long distance away, he heard his own voice saying, &#x201c;What caused the crash?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Does it matter?&#x201d; Setheris said. <br>&#x201c;Serenity,&#x201d; said the messenger with a deliberate nod in Maia&#x2019;s direction. &#x201c;They do not yet know. But the Lord Chancellor has sent Witnesses, and it is being investigated.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Maia. He knew neither what he felt nor what he ought to feel, but he knew what he ought to do, the next necessary thing. &#x201c;You said&nbsp;&#x2026; there are messages?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, Serenity.&#x201d; The messenger turned and picked up his dispatch case from where it lay on the side table. There was only one letter within, which the messenger held out. Setheris snatched the letter and broke the seal savagely, as if he still believed the messenger to be lying. <br>He scanned the paper, his customary frown deepening into a black scowl, then flung it at Maia and stalked from the room. Maia grabbed at it ineffectually as it fluttered to the floor. <br>The messenger knelt to retrieve it before Maia could and handed it to him without a flicker of expression. <br>Maia felt his face heating, his ears lowering, but he knew better than to try to explain or apologize for Setheris. He bent his attention to the letter. It was from his father&#x2019;s Lord Chancellor, Uleris Chavar: <br> <i>To the Archduke Maia Drazhar, heir to the imperial throne of Ethuveraz, greetings in this hour of greatest grief.</i> <br> <i>Knowing that Your Imperial Serenity will want all honor and respect paid to your late father and brothers, we have ordered arrangements put in train for a full ceremonial funeral in three days&#x2019; time, that is, on the twenty-third instant. We will notify the five principalities, also Your Imperial Serenity&#x2019;s sister in Ashedro. We have already ordered the courier office to put airships at their disposal, and we have no doubt that they will use all necessary haste to reach the Untheileneise Court in good time for the funeral.</i> <br> <i>We do not, of course, know what Your Imperial Serenity&#x2019;s plans may be, but we hold ourself ready to implement them.</i> <br> <i>With true sorrow and unswerving loyalty,</i> <br> <i>Uleris Chavar</i> <br>Maia looked up. The messenger was watching him, as impassive as ever; only the angle of his ears betrayed his interest. <br>&#x201c;I&nbsp;&#x2026; we must speak with our cousin,&#x201d; he said, the constructions of the formal first person awkward and unaccustomed. &#x201c;Do you&nbsp;&#x2026; that is, you must be tired. Let us summon a manservant to tend to your needs.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your Serenity is very kind,&#x201d; the messenger said, and if he knew that there were only two menservants in the entire household of Edonomee, he gave no sign. <br>Maia rang the bell, knowing that birdlike Pelchara would be waiting eagerly for a chance to find out what was happening. Haru, who did all the outside work, was probably still asleep; Haru slept like the dead, and the whole household knew it. <br>Pelchara popped in, his ears up and his eyes bright and inquisitive. &#x201c;This gentleman,&#x201d; Maia said, mortified to realize that he did not know the messenger&#x2019;s name, &#x201c;has traveled hard. Please see that he has everything he requires.&#x201d; He faltered before the thought of explaining the news to Pelchara, mumbled, &#x201c;I will be with my cousin,&#x201d; and hurried out. <br>He could see light under Setheris&#x2019;s door, and could hear his cousin&#x2019;s brisk, bristling stride. <i>Let him not have stopped for the metheglin decanter,</i> Maia thought, a brief, hopeless prayer, and tapped on the door. <br>&#x201c;Who is&#x2019;t?&#x201d; At least he did not <i>sound</i> any drunker than he had a quarter hour ago. <br>&#x201c;Maia. May I&#x2014;?&#x201d; <br>The door opened with savage abruptness, and Setheris stood in the opening, glaring. &#x201c;Well? What chews on <i>thy</i> tail, boy?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Cousin,&#x201d; Maia said, almost whispering, &#x201c;what must I do?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What must thou <i>do</i>?&#x201d; Setheris snorted laughter. &#x201c;Thou must be <i>emperor,</i> boy. Must rule all the Elflands and banish thy kindred as thou seest fit. Why com&#x2019;st thou whining to me of what thou must do?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Moon-witted hobgoblin,&#x201d; Setheris said, but it was contempt by reflex; his expression was abstracted. <br>&#x201c;Yes, cousin,&#x201d; Maia said meekly. <br>After a moment, Setheris&#x2019;s eyes sharpened again, but this time without the burning anger. &#x201c;Thou wish&#x2019;st advice?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, cousin.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; Setheris said, and Maia entered his cousin&#x2019;s bedchamber for the first time. <br>It was as austere as Setheris himself&#x2014;no mementoes of the Untheileneise Court, no luxuries. Setheris waved Maia to the only chair and himself sat on the bed. &#x201c;Thou&#x2019;rt right, boy. The wolves are waiting to devour thee. Hast thou the letter?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, cousin.&#x201d; Maia handed Setheris the letter, now rather crumpled and the worse for wear. Setheris read it, frowning again, but this time his ears were cocked thoughtfully. When he had finished, he folded the letter neatly, his long white fingers smoothing the creases. &#x201c;He presumes much, does Uleris.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He does?&#x201d; And then, realizing: &#x201c;Dost know him?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We were enemies for many years,&#x201d; Setheris said, shrugging it aside. &#x201c;And I see he has not changed.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What mean&#x2019;st thou?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Uleris has no reason to love thee, boy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He says he&#x2019;s loyal.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. But loyal to <i>what</i>? Not to thee, for thou art merely the last and least favored child of his dead master, who wished thee not on the throne, as well thou know&#x2019;st. Use thy wits, boy&#x2014;an thou hast any.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Merciful goddesses, grant me patience,&#x201d; Setheris said ostentatiously to the ceiling. &#x201c;Consider, boy. Thou art <i>emperor.</i> What must thou do first?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Cousin, this is not the time for riddles.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And it is not a riddle I pose thee.&#x201d; Setheris shut his mouth and glared at him, and after a moment, Maia realized. <br>&#x201c;The coronation.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; Setheris brought his hands together sharply, making Maia jump. &#x201c;Exactly. So why, I ask thee, does thy coronation not figure largely in Uleris&#x2019;s plans or, indeed, at all?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The funeral&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No! Thou think&#x2019;st as a child, not as an emperor. The dead are dead, and they care not for the honor Uleris prates of, as well <i>he</i> knows. It is the living power that must concern thee, as it concerns him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Think,</i> boy,&#x201d; Setheris said, leaning forward, his cold eyes alight with fervor. &#x201c;If thou art capable&#x2014;if thou hast ever thought before in thy life&#x2014; <i>think</i>. Thou com&#x2019;st to the Untheileneise Court, the funeral is held. What then?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I speak to&nbsp;&#x2026; oh.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thou seest.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Better than Setheris might care to realize, for it was at his cousin&#x2019;s hands that Maia had learned this particular lesson; by waiting, he put himself in the position of a supplicant to Chavar, and supplicants could always be denied. &#x201c;Then what must I do?&#x201d; <br>Setheris said, &#x201c;Thou must countermand Uleris. Meaning that thou must reach the Untheileneise Court before he has time to entrench himself.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But how can I?&#x201d; It took most of a week to reach the court from Edonomee. <br>&#x201c;Airship,&#x201d; Setheris said as if it were obvious. <br>Maia&#x2019;s stomach knotted. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thou <i>must.</i> Or thou shalt be a puppet dancing at the end of Uleris&#x2019;s strings, and to a tune of his choosing. And thy nineteenth birthday may very well see thee dead.&#x201d; <br>Maia bowed his head. &#x201c;Yes, cousin.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The airship that brought Chavar&#x2019;s lapdog here can take us back. They&#x2019;ll be waiting for him. Now, go. Make thyself fit to be seen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, cousin,&#x201d; Maia said, and did not contest Setheris&#x2019;s assumption that he would be traveling to the court with the new emperor. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Katherine Addison <br></p><h2>A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles</h2><p>Shows how social theorists--from William Godwin and Adam Smith in the eighteenth century to John Kenneth Galbraith and Milton Friedman in the twentieth--have based their thinking on two irreconcilable premises: the constrained and unconstrained vision</p><p><b>Thomas Sowell</b> has taught economics at a number of colleges and universities, including Cornell, University of California Los Angeles, and Amherst. He has published both scholarly and popular articles and books on economics, and is currently a scholar in residence at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.Sowell, an economist and author (The Economics and Politics of Race, etc.), presents a provocative analysis of the conflicting visions of human nature that have shaped the moral, legal and economic life of recent times. For the past 200 years, he writes, two visions ofor "gut feelings" abouthow the world works, have dominated: the constrained vision, which views man as unchanged, limited and dependent on evolved social processes (market economies, constitutional law, etc.); and the unconstrained vision, which argues for man's potential and perfectability, and the possibility of rational planning for social solutions. Examining the views of thinkers who reflect these constrained (Adam Smith) and unconstrained (William Godwin) visions, Sowell shows how these powerful and subjective visions give rise to carefully constructed social theories. His discussion of how these conflicting attitudes ultimately produce clashes over equality, social justice and other issues is instructive. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Ever-Loving Truth</h2><p>God&#39;s Word commands believers to contend for the Christian faith.

It can't just be "nature and nurture," because even identical twins who grow up together&#x2015;same genes, same parents&#x2015;have different personalities. And if psychologists can't explain why identical twins are different, they also can't explain why each of us differs from everyone else. Why no two people are alike. Harris turns out to be well suited for the role of detective&#x2015;it isn't easy to pull the wool over her eyes. She rounds up the usual suspects and shows why none of the currently popular explanations for human differences&#x2015;birth order effects, for example, or interactions between genes and environment&#x2015;can be the perpetrator she is looking for. None of these theories can solve the mystery of human individuality. The search for clues carries Harris into some fascinating byways of science. The evidence she examines ranges from classic experiments in social psychology to cutting-edge research in neuroscience. She looks at studies of twins, research on autistic children, observations of chimpanzees, birds, and even ants. Her solution is a startlingly original one: the first completely new theory of personality since Freud's. Based on a principle of evolutionary psychology&#x2015;the idea that the human mind is a toolbox of special-purpose devices&#x2015;Harris's theory explains how attributes we all have in common can make us different. This is the story of a scientific quest, but it is also the personal story of a courageous and innovative woman who refused to be satisfied with "what everyone knows is true."&nbsp; 12 b/w illustrations</p><p>Judith Rich Harris is an independent investigator and a former writer of textbooks in child development. She lives in New Jersey with her husband.Where does adult personality come from? Why are we all different? These are the questions energizing Judith Rich Harris&#x2019;s new book. <p>Harris, a former textbook author turned popular writer, dives right in, sharpening her focus by looking at identical twins. After subtracting the share contributed by their mutual genes&#x2014;about 45 percent&#x2014;studies show that adult identical twins are no more alike in personality than people plucked at random from a crowd, even though the siblings were raised in the same home, by the same parents, with identical schooling. </p><p>Where, then, do personality differences come from? Harris begins, in a savage fashion familiar to readers of her Nurture Assumption, by recounting factors that do not contribute to personality differences. She debunks dozens of studies by psychologists&#x2014;especially the "developmentalists" and "interventionists" who believe that better parenting or school environments can affect how children turn out&#x2014;by pointing out where they have fudged numbers and twisted results. She rejects the basis of psychoanalysis, stating there is no evidence that talking about childhood experiences has therapeutic value. She also maintains that learned behaviors do not readily transfer from one situation to another, noting that even babies behave differently to fit different environments. </p><p>To answer her opening questions, Harris then develops a complex scheme based on "the modular mind," a framework set forth by Harvard University evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker and others. (Harris herself has no doctorate and is housebound by systemic sclerosis and lupus, two autoimmune disorders.) She describes three modules&#x2014;the relationship system, the socialization system and the status system&#x2014;and explains how each contributes its part to making us who we are. The relationship system starts in the cradle as infants study and learn the faces and voices of the people around them, collecting information that helps form personality. The socialization system adapts people to their culture. The status system takes all the information collected during childhood and adolescence and shapes and modifies our personalities in accord with our environments. </p><p>Harris&#x2019;s last chapter lays out her theory in tabular form, explaining how each module interacts with the others to produce our distinct personalities. It is lavishly footnoted, like the rest of the book, shoring up her strategy of pointing out the failings of other models and then proposing her own. Her goal, she writes, is to explain the variations in personality that cannot be attributed to variations in people&#x2019;s genes. After saying she believes she has succeeded, she throws down her gauntlet: "I will leave it to other people to test my theory." </p><p><i>Jonathan Beard</i></p></p><h2>Cancer Schmancer</h2><p>The actress continues her life story and reveals how she overcame many obstables and challenges, including cancer, and shares the insights and wisdom she learned along the way.</p><p>From a disadvanged childhood in Queens, Fran Drescher rose to fame as the star of the successful sitcom THE NANNY.

Using rarely seen archival documents and remarkable first-person accounts, Peter Balakian presents the chilling history of how the Young Turk government implemented the first modern genocide behind the cover of World War I. And in the telling, he also resurrects an extraordinary lost chapter of American history.</p><p>During the United States' ascension in the global arena at the turn of the twentieth century, America's humanitarian movement for Armenia was an important part of the rising nation's first epoch of internationalism. Intellectuals, politicians, diplomats, religious leaders, and ordinary citizens came together to try to save the Armenians. <em>The Burning Tigris</em> reconstructs this landmark American cause that was spearheaded by the passionate commitments and commentaries of a remarkable cast of public figures, including Julia Ward Howe, Clara Barton, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Alice Stone Blackwell, Stephen Crane, and Ezra Pound, as well as courageous missionaries, diplomats, and relief workers who recorded their eyewitness accounts and often risked their lives in the killing fields of Armenia.</p> <p>The crisis of the "starving Armenians" was so embedded in American popular culture that, in an age when a loaf of bread cost a nickel, the American people sent more than $100 million in aid through the American Committee on Armenian Atrocities and its successor, Near East Relief. In 1915 alone, the <em>New York Times</em> published 145 articles about the Armenian Genocide.</p> <p>Theodore Roosevelt called the extermination of the Armenians "the greatest crime of the war." But in the turmoil following World War I, it was a crime that went largely unpunished. In depicting the 1919 Ottoman court-martial trials, Balakian reveals the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide confessing their guilt -- an astonishing fact given the Turkish government's continued denial of the Genocide.</p><p>After World War I, U.S. oil interests in the Middle East steered America away from the course it had pursued for four decades. As Balakian eloquently points out, America's struggle between human rights and national self-interest -- a pattern that would be repeated again and again -- resonates powerfully today. In crucial ways, America's involvement with the Armenian Genocide is a paradigm for the modern age.</p></p><p><p>Peter Balakian is the author of <em>Black Dog of Fate</em>, winner of the PEN/Martha Albrand Prize for Memoir and a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book, and <em>June-tree: New and Selected Poems 1974&#x2013;2000</em>. He is the recipient of many awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship. He holds a Ph.D. in American Civilization from Brown University and teaches at Colgate University, where he is a Donald M. and Constance H. Rebar Professor of the Humanities.</p>Now faded from memory in the shadow of the Holocaust, the Turkish slaughter of more than a million Armenians in 1915-1916 was a virtual template for the 20th-century horrors that followed, and much of what Balakian describes so powerfully is now chillingly familiar: inhuman brutality; mass deportations of helpless civilians (often in overcrowded railroad boxcars); headlines screaming of "systematic race extermination"; activists and intellectuals calling for intervention; and, most devastatingly, the lack of political will in the West to intervene to stop the slaughter. Balakian exposes the roots of the genocide in the "total war" atmosphere of WWI, which combusted with the pan-Turkish nationalism of the Young Turk government, inflamed Muslim rage against "infidel" Armenian Christians, and a long-simmering Ottoman hatred of the Armenians dating to Sultan Abdul Hamid II and his slaughters in the 1890s. Balakian, who wrote so movingly of the impact of the genocide on his own family in Black Dog of Fate, also underscores how well known the Armenian destruction was in America through detailed reports by U.S. consuls throughout Turkey and steady newspaper reporting, and how great the response was in providing humanitarian assistance to refugees and survivors. In a horrifying account, city by city, region by region, Balakian quotes firsthand testimony about the decimation of the Armenian population and their towns and culture. Yet he retains the measured tone of a historian throughout; if anything, he lets Woodrow Wilson off too easily for not declaring war on Turkey. But readers will come away sadly convinced that Armenians' brave but doomed stand in Van should be as celebrated as the Warsaw ghetto uprising, and the corpse-strewn Lake Gaeljak as well known as Babi Yar. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos and maps not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dressing Your Truth, Discover Your Type of Beauty</h2><p>This title is no longer being published.&nbsp; The Author recommends you read "It's Just My Nature" and go to dressing your truth dot com to go through the free Dressing Your Truth Beginners Guide.&nbsp; Updated Sept. 10, 2019.</p><p>Carol Tuttle is a teacher, speaker, gifted healer, and best-selling author of 7 books.

For women, that&#39;s an understatement. Turning beauty inside out Author tells women to ignore the latest trends and play up their personalities. Ever wish you could bring your therapist into the dressing room? Or at least learn how to have a healthier relationship with your mirror? The first step is to stop letting outside voices distract you from expressing your own true beauty, says Carol Tuttle, a Utah psychotherapist and the author of a new book that aims to turn long-standing beauty myths on their head, and to rescue fashion victims who repeatedly fall prey to the latest trends. Seven years ago, I started to take back my beauty, Tuttle, 52, writes in the self-published Dressing Your Truth: Discover Your Personal Beauty Profile (US$19.95). For most of her life, the wife and mother of five disliked her body and her; aged and masculine; features, and spent years trying to improve what she thought was originally flawed. By age 13, she so hated how she looked, she scribbled over her picture in the school yearbook. Mine is a typical example of a female journey; says Tuttle in a phone interview. We don&#39;t ever outgrow that original trauma that all women go through to varying degrees. The fashion world is based on a system of styles and trends. And when they don&#39;t personify your type of beauty, the default for women is to think it&#39;s their body and appearance that&#39;s at fault. The current system teaches us how to put on beauty, she says, not how to bring out our own. Just because a woman looks stylish doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s dressing her truth. One way to tell the difference is to notice whether you see the clothing, jewelry and makeup first, and then the woman. If she&#39;s dressing her truth, her body looks like a natural extension of her true self, Tuttle says. After years of doing therapy and discovering how intimately connected a woman&#39;s sense of fashion -- or lack thereof -- and her perceptions of body image and physical appearance are to her sense of self, Tuttle developed a beauty profiling system to tailor a woman&#39;s wardrobe to her personality type. It divides women into four basic types: Type 1, bright and animated; Type 2, subtle/soft; Type 3, rich/dynamic; and Type 4, bold/striking. Tuttle also points out that most current clothing systems only emphasize one thing -- colour. But there are four other elements in a garment -- design line, texture, fabrication and pattern -- than can either add to our natural beauty or conflict with it. Sorry to break the news, but that perfect little black dress is a myth. In fact, Tuttle says wearing black can actually make a woman look heavier and older. No movement, no expression, just stillness, and on most women, it&#39;s deadly. (Only Type 4s can really pull it off. For the other types, she recommends various shades of brown.) Apparently even the rich and famous make the mistake of following trends instead of choosing clothes that look good on them and suit their personality. Take Michelle Obama. Although she has become a fixture in fashion magazines, Tuttle says the American first lady (a Type 3) is not dressing her truth. They dress her as a Type 4, and that can make a Type 3 appear harsh and overly intense. Quite often, she&#39;s also shown in that mommy look because that&#39;s such an important part of who she is, but it doesn&#39;t honour her beauty either. Despite all the plastic surgery, Joan Rivers (Type 3), on the other hand, makes a bold and edgy fashion statement that matches her personality. Tuttle&#39;s book will help readers discover their own beauty profile.

Thirty years later, it speaks to teenagers as powerfully as ever.Puffin is proud to publish this contemorary classic for a new generation of readers. Praise for THE OUTSIDERS "This remarkable novel gives a moving, credible view of the outsiders from the inside. . . we meet powerful characters in a book with a powerful message." -- The Horn Book<br> "Taut with tension, filled with drama . . ." -- The Chicago Tribune</p><p>According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for &#34;social&#34;) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he&#39;s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy&#39;s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser. This classic, written by S. E. Hinton when she was 16 years old, is as profound today as it was when it was first published in 1967.Ponyboy is fourteen, tough and confused, yet sensitive behind his bold front. Since his parents&#39; death, his loyalties have been to his brothers and his gang, the rough, swinging, long-haired boys from the wrong side of the tracks. When his best friend, Johnny, kills a member of a rival gang, a nightmare of violence begins and swiftly envelops Ponyboy in a turbulent chain of events.</p><h2>Killing Grounds</h2><p>Lending a hand on a salmon boat under the Alaskan summer sun, Kate Shugak reels in some unusual suspects in the murder of a roundly despised commercial fisherman, including his troubled teenaged son and his less-than-grief-stricken widow. Reprint.</p><p>Like Nevada Barr, Dana Stabenow writes mysteries so firmly rooted in the natural world that their sense of place becomes a vital part of the plot. In this book about Native Alaskan crime solver Kate Shugak, the ocean and the men who fish it for salmon are described in such vivid detail that you'll never look at a salmon steak the same way again. When a particularly nasty fisherman is murdered, there's no end of suspects--including members of Kate's own family. The story also sports a richly ironic undertone of political incorrectness, as Kate muses about the forest rangers, "who wanted to annex every square foot of land they saw and keep it pristine and inviolate, unsullied by human hand. They failed to recall that the indigenous peoples who came across the Bering land bridge during the last Ice Age had their hands all over anything that had the remotest possibility of nutritional value, and were every bit as much of the landscape and the wheel of life as the fish and the birds and the mammals." Previous Shugak sorties in paperback include <i>Breakup</i>, <i>Blood Will Tell</i>, <i>Play with Fire</i>, and <i>A Cold-Blooded Business</i>.Dana Stabenow was born in Anchorage and raised on a 75-foot fish tender in the Gulf of Alaska. She knew there was a warmer, drier job out there somewhere and found it in writing. Her first crime fiction novel, A Cold Day for Murder, won an Edgar award. Her first thriller, Blindfold Game, hit the New York Times bestseller list.</p>
